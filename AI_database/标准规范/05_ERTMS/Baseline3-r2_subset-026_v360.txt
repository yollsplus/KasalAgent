Introduction  Page 5/8 
 1.3 Introduction  
1.3.1.1  Train control is an important part of any railway opera tions management system. In the 
past a number of different Automatic Train Control (ATC) systems have evolved in 
different countries at different times. These systems are incompatible and not 
interoperable with each other. Only a few of these systems are u sed in more than one 
country, and even in those cases there have been differences in detailed development 
which have resulted in incompatible and not interoperable versions.  
1.3.1.2  Many railways anticipate a significant increase in density of train traffic and ar e 
rethinking their i nfrastructure strategy, to accommodate high levels of traffic, in which 
ATC systems play an important part. Also many railways would like to introduce 
standardised systems to reduce system costs. In order to establish international 
standardisation of ATC systems, the following document specifies the European Rail 
Traffic Management System/European Train Control System (ERTMS/ETCS).  
1.4 Advantages of an International Interoperable System  
1.4.1.1  The advantages expected by the railways can be summaris ed as:  
 Cross border interoperability.  
 Improvement of the safety of national and international train traffic.  
 Improvement of international passengers and freight train traffic management.  
 Shorter headway on heavily trafficked lines, by driving on moving bl ock, enabling 
exploitation of maximum track capacity.  
 The possibility of step -by-step introduction of the new technology.  
 Enabling Pan -European competition between the manufacturers of ERTMS/ETCS 
components. Strengthe ning the position of the European railw ay industry on the 
world market.  
 Enabling preconditions for future harmonisation in other areas of rail traffic 
management.  
1.5 About this Document  
1.5.1.1  The purpose of this document is to specify the unified European Train Control System 
(ETCS ) from a technical poi nt of view.  
1.5.1.2  Some parts of the system are only specified to allow a migration from existing train 
control systems to ETCS (e.g. STM’s) over a transition period. They might be removed 
in a future edition of the standard.  
1.5.1.3  To reach technical interoperability i t is necessary not only that telegrams are generated 
and understood according to well specified rules but also that a train respectively

 trackside equipment reacts in a uniform way to information received. Technical 
interoperability requires spec ifications  of a detailed level.  
1.5.1.4  For operational interoperability it is necessary to add operating rules, engineering 
standards etc. to the system design. Reaching operational interoperability i s outside 
the scope of the SRS.  
1.6 How to Read and Use the SRS  
1.6.1.1  The SRS cover s 9 chapters, which are briefly described in the section following this 
introduction.  
1.6.1.2  All readers may need to refer to the Glossary  of terms and abbreviations (SUBSET -
023). 
1.7 Requirements  
1.7.1.1  This specification defines the functions that allow reaching the techn ical 
interoperability. This is materialised through numbered clauses which are formally 
identified as containing ERTMS/ETCS on -board and/or ERTMS/ETCS trackside 
requirements (see details in chapter 9) . 
1.7.1.2  The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall implement all its allocated  requirements, 
with the only exceptions and conditions explicitly stated in the Control -Command and 
Signalling TSI and in this SRS . 
1.7.1.3  For ERTMS/ETCS trackside the implementation of functions has to be defined 
according to the characteristics of the specific lines and the related operational needs. 
In any case, the requirements of this SRS , which are allocated to the trackside and  
related to the implemented functions , shall be respected . 
1.7.1.4  Intentionally deleted . 
1.7.1.5  Not specified requirements and soluti ons shall only be permitted as long as they do not 
generate any interoperability problems.  
 
1.8 Contents of the SRS  
1.8.1.1  The SRS defines the system requirements for the European Train Control System 
(ETCS) of ERTMS.  
1.8.1.2  This sub -section is intended to give a rough over view of the contents of each chapter 
within the SRS so that readers interested only in specialised subjects can easily find 
the relevant chapters.

 1.8.2  Chapter 1:  Introduction  
1.8.2.1  Chapter 1 (this chapter) gives a general introduction to the intention and structure of 
the SRS, including a brief overview of the contents of each chapter.  
1.8.3  Chapter 2:  Basic System Description  
1.8.3.1  Chapter 2 gives an overview of the ERTMS/ETCS system structure.  
1.8.3.2  Chapter 2 also contains a description o f the basic application levels.  
1.8.3.3  Chapter 2 doe s not contain technical requirements.  
1.8.4  Chapter 3:  Principles  
1.8.4.1  Chapter 3 specifies the system principles of ETCS/ERTMS. These principles apply to 
onboard and trackside subsystems.  
1.8.4.2  The principles define the behaviour of the system i n general and functional ter ms. 
1.8.5  Chapter 4:  Modes and Transitions  
1.8.5.1.1  Chapter 4 defines the modes of the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment and all 
transitions between modes.  
1.8.6  Chapter 5:  Procedures  
1.8.6.1  Chapter 5 defines the dynamic behaviour of procedures that are necessary for 
interoperability. Pro cedures are presented by a state transition chart and a 
corresponding table, where all elements (States, events, transitions) of the chart are 
defined. The description of the procedures shows all states of the ERTMS/ETCS 
onboard unit and the conditions tha t must be fulfilled to switch from one state to 
another.  
1.8.7  Chapter 6:  Management of older System Versions  
1.8.7.1.1  Chapter 6 defines the envelope of legally operated system versions and list s the 
exceptions that shall apply by derogation to the requirements listed in  the other 
chapters of the SRS, when an older ERTMS/ETCS system version is used  by the 
trackside subsystem . 
1.8.8  Chapter 7:  ERTMS/ETCS Language  
1.8.8.1  Chapter 7 defines and describes the necessary variables to be used for the data flow 
over the air gap between track a nd train. The grouping of these into packets is 
described. The format of messages is given in Chapter 8.

1.8.9.1  Chapter 8 defines the application protocol (format and content of messages, logical 
sequence for radio) necessary to achieve techni cal interoperability.  
1.8.9.2  The scope of this chapter is limited to the application protoc ol and the content of 
messages.  
1.8.10  Chapter 9:  Classification of the SRS clauses  
1.8.10.1  Chapter 9 encloses a classification into categories of all the clauses in the chapters 1 
to 8 o f the SRS.  
1.8.10.2  In particular to assess properly the compliance of an ERTMS/ETCS on -board 
equipment with the SRS, it identifies which clauses contain requirements allocated to 
the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment and conversely which ones do not, either 
because th ey contain requirements allocated to the ERTMS/ETCS trackside only or 
because they are of another type.

 2.4 System structure  
2.4.1.1  Due to the nature of the required functions, the ERTMS/ETCS sy stem  will have to be 
partly on the trackside and partly on board the trains.  
2.4.1.2  This defines two subsystems, the on -board subsystem and the trackside subsystem.  
2.4.1.3  The environment of ERTMS/ETCS system is composed of:  
a) the train, which will then be considered in the train interface specification;  
b) the driver, which will then be considered via the driver interface specification;  
c) other onboard interfaces (see architecture drawing in 2.5.3),  
d) external trackside systems (interlockings, control centres, etc.), for which no 
interoperability requirement will be established.

 2.5 Subsystems  
2.5.1  Trackside subsystem  
2.5.1.1  Depending of the application level (see further sections), the trackside subsystem can 
be composed of:  
a) balise  
b) lineside electronic unit  
c) the radio communication network (GSM -R) 
d) the Radio Block Centre (RBC)  
e) Euroloop  
f) Radio infill unit  
g) Key Management Centre (KMC)  
h) Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)  
2.5.1.2  Balise  
2.5.1.2.1  The balise is a transmission device that can send telegrams to the on -board 
subsystem.  
2.5.1.2.2  The balise is based on the existing Euroba lise specifications. These documents are 
included in the frame of the ERTMS/ETCS specifications.  
2.5.1.2.3  The balises provides the up -link, i. e. the possibility to send messages from trackside 
to the on -board subsystem.  
2.5.1.2.4  The balises can provide fixed messages or, w hen connected to a lineside electronic 
unit, messages that can be changed.  
2.5.1.2.5  The balises will be organised in groups, each balise transmitting a telegram and the 
combination of all telegrams defining the message sent by the balise group.  
2.5.1.3  Lineside electronic  unit 
2.5.1.3.1  The lineside electronic units are electronic devices, that generate telegrams to be sent 
by balises, on basis of information received from external trackside systems.  
2.5.1.4  Trackside radio communication network (GSM -R) 
2.5.1.4.1  The GSM -R radio communication network  is used for the bi -directional exchange of 
messages between on -board subsystems and RBC or radio infill units.

Basic System Description  Page 9/25 
 2.5.1.5.1  The RBC is a computer -based system that elaborates messages to be sent to the train 
on basis of information received from external trackside systems and on basis of 
information exchanged with the on -board sub systems.  
2.5.1.5.2  The main objective of these messages is to provide movement authorities to allow the 
safe movement of trains on the Railway infrastructure area under the re sponsibility of 
the RBC.  
2.5.1.5.3  The interoperability requirements for the RBC are mainly related to the data exchange 
between the RBC and the on -board subsystem.  
2.5.1.6  Euroloop  
2.5.1.6.1  The Euroloop subsystem operates on Level 1 lines, providing signalling information in 
advanc e as regard to the next main signal in the train running direction.  
2.5.1.6.2  The Euroloop subsystem is composed of an on -board functionality and by one or more 
trackside parts.  
2.5.1.7  Radio infill Unit  
2.5.1.7.1  The RADIO INFILL subsystem operates on Level 1 lines, providing signa lling 
information in advance as regard to the next main signal in the train running direction.  
2.5.1.7.2  The RADIO INFILL subsystem is composed of an on -board functionality and by one or 
more trackside parts (named RADIO INFILL Unit).  
2.5.1.8  KMC  
2.5.1.8.1  The role of the KMC is to manage the cryptographic keys, which are used to secure 
the EURORADIO communications between the ERTMS/ETCS entities (ERTMS/ETCS

 2.6 Levels and transitions  
2.6.1  Introduction  
2.6.1.1  The different ERTMS/ETCS application levels (short: levels) are a way  to express the 
possible operating relationships between track and train. Level definitions are related 
to the trackside equipment used, to the way trackside information reaches the on -
board units and to which functions are processed in the trackside and i n the on -board 
equipment respectively.  
2.6.1.2  Different levels have been defined to allow each individual railway administration to 
select the appropriate ERTMS/ETCS application trackside, according to their 
strategies, to their trackside infrastructure and to t he required performance. 
Furthermore, the different application levels permit the interfacing of individual 
signalling systems and train control systems to ERTMS/ETCS.  
2.6.1.3  For the purpose of a consistent specification a level 0 has been defined. This level is 
used for operation on non -equipped (unfitted) lines or on lines  equip ped with train 
control system(s)  but operation under their supervision is currently not possible .  
2.6.2  Definitions  
2.6.2.1  A train equipped with ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment always co -operates with the 
ERTMS/ETCS trackside equipment in a defined ERTMS/ETCS level.  
2.6.2.2  All transitions between levels are performed according to well -specified rules.  
2.6.2.3  ERTMS/ETCS can be configured to operate in one of the following application levels:  
 ERTMS/ETCS Level 0 (tra in equipped with ERTMS/ETCS operating on a line not 
equipped with any train control system  (ERTMS/ETCS or national system ) or on a 
line equipped with ERTMS/ETCS and/or national system (s) but operation under 
their supervision is currently not possible ) 
 ERTM S/ETCS Level NTC (train equipped with ERTMS/ETCS operating on a line 
equipped with a national system)  
 ERTMS/ETCS Application Level 1 with or without infill transmission (train equipped 
with ERTMS/ETCS operating on a line equipped with Eurobalises and optio nally 
Euroloop or Radio infill)  
 ERTMS/ETCS Application Level 2 (train equipped with ERTMS/ETCS operating on 
a line controlled by a Radio Block Centre and equipped with Eurobalises and 
Euroradio) with train position and train integrity proving performed by the trackside  
 ERTMS/ETCS Application Level 3 (similar to level 2 but with train position and train 
integrity supervision based on information received from the train)

 2.6.2.4  It is possible to superimpose several application levels in parallel on the same track, for 
example to run trains without train integrity device in level 2 and in parallel trains 
equipped with train integrity device in level 3. Other examples might be a station which 
is shared by trains arriving over level 1 and level 2 lines (junctions) or p arallel operation 
of a national system with ERTMS/ETCS. Mixed levels are supported.

2.6.2.6  Intentionally deleted . 
2.6.2.7  It is possible to transmit information not intended for ERTMS/ETCS but for other 
systems over the ERTMS/ETCS transmission chan nels. This information is not used  
by ERTMS/ETCS.

 2.6.3  ERTMS/ETCS Application Level 0  
2.6.3.1  General description  
2.6.3.1.1  Level 0 covers operation of ETCS equipped trains on lines not equipped with ETCS or 
national systems or on lines where trackside ERTMS/ETCS infrastructure  and/or 
national systems may exist but operation under their supervision is currently not 
possible (e.g. commissioning or on -board/trackside failed components) .  
2.6.3.1.2  In Level 0 it is authorized to operate trains without any train control system and 
therefore line side optical signals or other means of signalling are used to give 
movement authorities to the driver.  
2.6.3.1.3  ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment provides no supervision except of the maximum 
design speed of a train and maximum speed permitted in unfitted areas.  
2.6.3.1.4  Train detection and train integrity supervision are performed by the trackside 
equipment of the underlying signalling system (interlocking, track circuits etc.) and are 
outside the scope of ERTMS/ETCS.  
2.6.3.1.5  Level 0 uses no track -train transmission except Euroba lises to announce/command 
level transitions. Eurobalises therefore still have to be read. No balise data except 
certain special commands are interpreted.  
2.6.3.1.6  No supervisory information is indicated on the DMI except the train speed. Train data 
has to be entere d in order not to have to stop a train at a level transition to 
ERTMS/ETCS equipped area and to supervise maximum train speed.

2.6.4.1  General description  
2.6.4.1.1  Level NTC is used to run ERTMS/ETCS equipped trains on lines equipped with 
national train control and speed supervision systems.  
2.6.4.1.2  Train control information generated trackside by the national train contr ol system is 
transmitted to the train via the communication channels of the underlying national 
system.  
2.6.4.1.3  Note: Lineside optical signals might be necessary or not, depending on the 
performance and functionality of the underlying systems.  
2.6.4.1.4  Intentionally dele ted.  
2.6.4.1.5  The achievable level of supervision is similar to the one provided by the underlying 
national systems.  
2.6.4.1.6  Train detection and train integrity supervision are performed by equipment external to 
ERTMS/ETCS.  
2.6.4.1.7  Level NTC uses no ERTMS/ETCS track -train information  except to 
announce/command level transitions and specific commands related to balise 
transmission. Eurobalises therefore still have to be read.  
2.6.4.1.8  The information displayed to the driver depends on the functionality of the underlying 
national system. T he active national system  is indicated to the driver as part of that 
information. Full train data has to be entered in order not to have to stop a train at a 
level transition position and to supervise maximum train speed.  
2.6.4.1.9  A combination of national systems can be regarded as one NTC level.  
2.6.4.1.10  Depending on the functionality and the configuration of the specific national system 
installed onboard, the ERTMS/ETCS Onboard system may need to be interfaced to it, 
in order to perform the transitions from/to the nationa l system and/or in order to give 
access to ERTMS/ETCS Onboard resources (e.g. DMI). This can be achieved through 
a device called an STM (Specific Transmission Module) using a standardised interface .

2.6.5  ERTMS/ETCS Application Level 1  
2.6.5.1  General description  
2.6.5.1.1  ERTMS/ETCS Level 1 is a spot transmission based train control system to be used as 
an overlay on an underlying signalling system.  
2.6.5.1.2  Movement auth orities are generated trackside and are transmitted to the train via  
Eurobalises.  
2.6.5.1.3  ERTMS/ETCS Level 1 provides a continuous speed supervision system, which also 
protects against overrun of the authority.  
2.6.5.1.4  Train detection and train integrity supervision ar e performed by the trackside 
equipment of the underlying signalling system (interlocking, track circuits etc.) and are 
outside the scope of ERTMS/ETCS.  
2.6.5.1.5  Level 1 is based on Eurobalises as spot transmission devices.   
2.6.5.1.6  The trackside equipment does not know th e train to which it sends information.  
2.6.5.1.7  If in level 1 a lineside signal clears, an approaching train can not receive this 
information until it passes the Eurobalise group at that signal. The driver therefore has 
to observe the lineside signal to know when t o proceed. The train has then to be 
permitted to approach the stopping location below a maximum permitted release 
speed.  
2.6.5.1.8  Additional Eurobalises can be placed between distant and main signals to transmit infill 
information, the train will receive new infor mation before reaching the signal.  
2.6.5.1.9  Note: Lineside signals are required in level 1 applications, except if semi -continuous 
infill is provided.  
2.6.5.1.10  Semi -continuous infill can be provided using Euroloop or radio infill. In this case, the 
on-board system will be able to show new information to the driver as soon as it is 
available and even at standstill.  
2.6.5.1.11  Euroloop or radio infill can improve the safety of a level 1 system as they allow the 
operation without release speed.

 3.3 Introduction  
3.3.1  Scope and purpose  
3.3.1.1  The chapter 3, Principles, specifies the system principles of ETCS/ERTMS. These 
principles apply to on -board and trackside subsystems . 
3.3.1.2  The principles define the operational and technical behaviour of the system in general 
and functional terms.  
3.3.1.3  The chapter is divided into subchapters. In each subchapter normally several 
requirements are defined. Each requirement is identified with a unique identification 
number . 
3.3.1.4  Notes, Justifications and Examples are only informative and shall not be regarded as 
requirements.  
3.4 Balise configuration and linking  
3.4.1  Balise Configurations – Balise Group Definition  
3.4.1.1  A balise group shall consist of between one and eight balises.  
3.4.1.2  In every ba lise shall at least be stored:  
a) The internal number (from 1 to 8) of the balise  
b) The number of balises inside the group  
c) The balise group identity.  
3.4.1.3  The internal number of the balise describes the relative position of the balise in the 
group.  
3.4.2  Balise Co -ordinat e System  
3.4.2.1.1  Every balise group has its own co -ordinate system.  
3.4.2.1.2  The orientation of the co -ordinate system of a balise group (i.e., nominal or reverse 
direction) is identified as balise group orientation.  
3.4.2.2  Balise groups composed of two or more balises  
3.4.2.2.1  The origin  of the co -ordinate system for each balise group is given by the balise 
number 1 (called location reference) in the balise group.  
3.4.2.2.2  The nominal direction of each balise group is defined by increasing internal balise 
numbers.

the linked balise group will be passed over" received from a previous ba lise group shall

3.4.2.3.2.3  The reference for the linking data shall be either a single b alise group if a co -
ordinate system has been assigned to it before, or a balise group consisting of two or 
more balises (with "inherent" co -ordinate system)  
3.4.2.3.3  Level 2/3:  
3.4.2.3.3.1  If the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment cannot evaluate the orientation of the last 
balise group detected, being a single balise group, i.e. no linking information is 
available to identify the orientation of the co -ordinate system of this single balise group, 
the ERTMS/ETCS on-board  equipment shall report its position by means of a position 
report based on two balise groups reporting the train position in reference to the LRBG 
and the “previous LRBG”, if any.  
3.4.2.3.3.1.1  Note: Receiving this type of position report advises the RBC of the need to assign a 
co-ordinate system to this single balise group.  
3.4.2.3.3.2  When a  single balise group is detected and the previous LRBG is known, the 
position report based on two balise groups shall use as direction reference a move 
from the  “previous LRBG”  towards this single balise group (being the new LRBG): 
directional information in the position report pointing in the same direction as the 
direction reference shall be reported as “nominal”, otherwise as “reverse”.  
3.4.2.3.3.3  If the “previous LRBG “ is not known, the “previous LRBG” and all directional 
information of the position report based on two balise groups shall be reported as 
“unknown”.  
3.4.2.3.3.4  If a new single balise group (BG2), different from the current LRBG (BG1), 
becomes LRBG while the running direction of the train is opposite to the running 
direction when this current LRBG (BG1) was last  passed, the “previous LRBG” and all

 directional information of the position report based on two balise groups shall be 
reported as “unknown” (see Figure 2a).

3.4.2.3.3.5  If a single balise group, being the LRBG,  is detected again, the LRBG and the 
“previous LRBG” of the position report based on two balise groups shall remain 
unchanged.  
3.4.2.3.3.6  The assignment of a co -ordinate system received from the RBC shall iden tify the 
balise group for which the assignment is given, and shall assign a balise group

 3.4.3  Balise Information Types and Usage  
3.4.3.1  In level 1, a ll information to the on -board system is given from balise groups or 
additionally from EUROLOOPS or Radio Infill Units  (see section 3.9). In level 2/3, 
balise g roups are mostly used for location information.  
3.4.3.2  A balise may contain directional information , i.e. valid either  for nominal or for reverse 
direction , or may contain information valid for both directions . In level 1, t his 
information can be of the following  type (please refer to section 3.8.5 ): 
a) Non-infill 
b) Intentionally deleted  
c) Infill. 
3.4.3.2.1  Intentionally deleted . 
3.4.3.2.2  Note: Infill information is referring to the location reference of an announced balise 
group.  
3.4.3.3  Some information shall be read  also in sleeping mode and when no linking information 
is available (see Chapter 4 Use of received information). If such information is 
transmitted by balises, and if the information is directional, balise groups consisting of 
at least two balises shall be  used.  
3.4.4  Linking  
3.4.4.1  Introduction  
3.4.4.1.1  Aim of linking:  
 To determine whether a balise group has been missed or not found within the 
expectation window (see section 3.4.4.4 ) and take the appropriate action.  
 To assign a co -ordinate system to balise groups consisting of a single balise.  
 To correct the confidence interval due to odometer inaccuracy (see section 3.6.4 ). 
3.4.4.1.2  A balise group is linked when its linking information (see section 3.4.4.2 ) is known in 
advance.  
3.4.4.1.2.1  Note: In cases where a balise group contains repositioning information, the term 
linked also applies since the balise group is announced, marked as linked and contains 
repositioning information marked accordingly.  
3.4.4.2  Content of l inking information  
3.4.4.2.1  Linking information shall be composed of:  
a) The identity of the linked balise group.  
b) Where the location reference of the group has to be found.

SUBSET -026-3

13/05/2016  System Requirements Specification  
Chapter 3  
Principles  Page 15/204 
 c) The accuracy of this location.  
Note: If the reference balise is duplicated, it is the trackside  responsibility to define 
the location accuracy to cover at least the location of the two duplicated balises.  
d) The direction with which the linked balise group will be passed over (nominal or 
reverse).  
e) The reaction required if a data consistency problem occ urs with the expected balise 
group.  
3.4.4.2.1.1  "Linking information is used" shall be interpreted as when balise group(s) are 
announced and the minimum safe antenna position has not yet passed the expectation 
window of the furthest announced balise group.  
3.4.4.2.2  Instead of the identity of a linked balise group it shall be possible to identify a following 
linked balise group as unknown but containing repositioning information  
3.4.4.2.2.1  Intentionally deleted.  
3.4.4.2.2.2  Note 1: Regarding the repositioning information, see chapter 3.8.5.3.5  and 3.8.5.2.  
3.4.4.2.2.3  Note 2: In case the identity of the next balise group is not unambiguously known 
because the route is not known by the trackside, this feature allows to link this balise 
group.  
3.4.4.2.3  For each linked balise group , the trackside shall select one of the following reactions to 
be used in case of data inconsistencies:  
a) Train trip  (Trip mode, see Chapter 4)  
b) Command service brake  
c) No reaction  
For further details see section 3.16.2 . 
3.4.4.3  Unlinked Balise Groups  
3.4.4.3.1  A balise group, which contains information that must be considered even when the 
balise group is not announced by linking, is called an unlinked balise group.  
3.4.4.3.2  Unlinked balise groups shall consist at minimum of two balises.   
3.4.4.3.3  Unlinked balise groups shall alw ays contain the unlinked balise group qualifier.  
3.4.4.4  Rules related to linking  
3.4.4.4.1  When no linking information is used on -board, all balise groups shall be taken into 
account.  
3.4.4.4.2  When linking information is used on -board, only balise groups marked as linked and 
includ ed in the linking information and balise groups marked as unlinked shall be taken 
into account.

 3.4.4.4.2.1  When linking information is used on -board and the expected balise group is referred 
in the linking information with a balise group with ID “unknown”, a balise g roup marked 
as linked shall only be taken into account if:  
a) the on-board equipment  can determine the orientation of the linked balise group by 
information from the balise group itself (therefore excluding for example single 
balise groups), AND  
b) the balise gr oup contains repositioning information valid for the train orientation, 
AND  
c) the balise group is crossed with the direction announced in the linking information.  
3.4.4.4.3  The on -board equipment shall accept a balise group marked as linked and included in 
the linking  information (i.e. the balise giving the location reference) from  
 when the max safe front end of the train has passed the first possible location of 
the balise group  
until  
 the min safe front end of the train has passed the last possible location of the 
balise group  
taking the offset between the front of the train and the balise antenna into account.  
3.4.4.4.3.1  Note: The first possible location and the last possible location of the balise group 
are defined by the linking distance and the location accuracy.  
3.4.4.4.3.2  Note: The  interval between the outer limits to accept the balise group defines the 
expectation window.  
3.4.4.4.4  In case of a balise group containing repositioning information, the first possible location 
shall start from the previously linked balise group.  
3.4.4.4.5  The on -board equi pment shall expect balise groups one by one (i.e., it shall supervise 
only one expectation window at a time) according to the order given by linking 
information.  
3.4.4.4.6  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall stop expecting a balise group and shall 
expect the nex t one announced in the linking information (if any) when:  
a) the balise group is found inside its expectation window  
b) a linking consistency error is found, see 3.16.2.3.1  
3.4.4.4.6.1  Linking consistency error due to early reception of balise group expected later (see 
3.16.2.3.1 c)): if the balise group found is the next one announced in the linking 
information, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall check its linking consistency 
and apply again clause 3.4.4.4.6, i.e. it will immediately expect the further next balise 
group announced in the linking information.

the memorized or default Radio Network,  attempts to register to this Radio Network will 
be repeated unconditionally by the Mobile Terminal(s) until either an attempt is 
successful or a new Radio Network identity is received from trackside or from driver, 
preventing Mobile Terminal(s) from regis tering to any unwanted Radio Network . 
3.5.6.4  Intentionally deleted . 
3.5.6.5  On reception of the trackside order, ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall 
immediately order the Radio Network registration of each Mobile Terminal that fulfils 
the following conditions:  
a) it is not yet registered to the ordered Radio Network, AND  
b) it is not used for an established communication session, AND  
c) no safe radio connection is being set -up 
3.5.6.6  If a Mobile Terminal is not currently registered to the Radio Network ordered by 
trackside and if one of the conditions b) or c) is not fulfilled, ERTMS/ETCS on -board 
equipment shall initiate the Radio Network registration once communication session is 
terminated and safe radio connection is released.  
3.5.6.7  If no Mobile Terminal is duly registered to a Radio Networ k, any order to contact an 
RBC or an RIU received from trackside shall be rejected by ERTMS/ETCS on -board 
equipment.  
3.5.7  Safe Radio Connection Indication  
3.5.7.1  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall inform the driver about the status of the 
safe radio connection. T o that purpose, the following indication statuses of the safe 
radio connection are defined: “No Connection”, “Connection Lost/Set -Up failed”, 
“Connection Up”.

 3.5.7.2  In addition, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall use a “connection status” 
timer (see Appendi x A.3.1), in order to manage properly the transitions to the indication 
status “Connection Lost/Set -Up failed”.  
3.5.7.2.1  Note: The purpose of the “connection status” timer is to avoid distracting the driver for 
any short disturbance of the safe radio connection.  
3.5.7.3  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall start the “connection status” timer as 
soon as the first request to set -up a safe radio connection with the relevant RBC/RIU is 
sent:  
a) for what regards the session establishment, see items b), c), d), e) in 3.5.3.4.  
b) for what regards maintaining a communication session, see 3.5.4.2 and 3.5.4.4  
3.5.7.4  If the “connection status” timer is ongoing, it shall be stopped if the requests to set -up 
a safe radio connection are stopped with the relevant RBC/RIU . 
3.5.7.5  The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equ ipment shall execute the transitions between the 
different indication statuses of the safe radio connection with the relevant RBC/RIU as 
described in Table 1 according to the conditions in Table  2 (see se ction 4.6.1 for

driver shall switch from the indication status of the safe radio co nnection with the 
Handing over RBC to the one with the Accepting RBC as soon as one of the following 
conditions is met:  
a) the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment sends a position report directly to the 
Accepting RBC with its maximum safe front end having passed th e border, see 
3.15.1.3.5 (i.e. the Accepting RBC becomes the supervising RBC),  
b) the safe radio connection is released with the Handing over RBC and the minimum 
safe rear end of the train has crossed the border, see 3.15.1.2.7  and 3.15.1.3.9 . 
3.5.7.6.1  Note: During an  RBC/RBC handover procedure, an indication status transition table 
and a connection status timer might have to be managed at the same time, for each 
RBC.  
3.5.7.7  For the case of safe radio connection with RIU’s, the safe radio connection indicated to

3.6 Location Principles,  Train Position and Train Orientation  
3.6.1  General  
3.6.1.1  Two types of location based data are defined : 
a) Data that refers only to a given location, referred to as Location data (e.g. level 
transitio n orders, linking)

Principles  Page 27/204 
 b) Data that remains valid for a certain distance, referred to as Profile data (e.g. SSP, 
gradient).  
3.6.1.2  Note: Determination of the Train Position  is always longitudinal along the route, even 
though the route might be set through a complex tra ck layout.

Figure 7: Route known by the train  
 
3.6.1.3  The Train Position information defines the position of the train front in relation  to a 
balise group, which is called LRBG ( the Last Relevant Balise Group). It includes:  
 The estimated train front end position, defined by the estimated distance between 
the LRBG and the front end of the train  
 The train position confidence interva l (see 3.6.4)  
 Directional train position information in reference to the balise group orientation 
(see 3.4.2, also Figure 14) of the LRBG, regarding:  
 the position of the train front end (nominal or reverse side of the LRBG)  
 the train orientation  
 the train  running direction  
In case of an LRBG being a single balise group with no co -ordinate system 
assigned, directional information is defined in reference to the pair of LRBG and 
“previous LRBG”, see 3.4.2.3.3  
 A list of LRBGs, which may alternatively be used b y trackside for referencing 
location dependent information (see 3.6.2.2.2  c)). 
3.6.1.4  Balise groups, which are marked as unlinked, shall never be used as LRBG.

 3.6.1.4.1  Justification: The location of an unlinked balise group, or the balise group itself, may 
not be known t o the RBC.  
3.6.1.5  If there is an active cab, this one defines the orientation of the train, i.e . the side of the 
active cab shall be considered as the front of the train. If no cab is active, the train 
orientation shall be as when a cab was last active.  
3.6.1.6  The “trai n orientation relative to LRBG” is defined as the train orientation related to the 
orientation of the LRBG, see Figure 14. It can be either “nominal” or “reverse”.  
3.6.1.6.1  Note: The train orientation cannot be affected by the direction control ler position.  
3.6.2  Location of Data Transmitted to the On -Board Equipment  
3.6.2.1  Data Transmitted by Balises  
3.6.2.1.1  All location and profile data transmitted by a balise shall refer to the location reference 
and orientation of the balise group to which the balise belongs.  
3.6.2.1.2  Exception: Regarding infill information the section 3.6.2.3.1  shall apply . 
3.6.2.2  Data Transmitted by Radio from RBC  
3.6.2.2.1  All location and profile data transmitted from the RBC shall refer to the location 
reference and orientation of the LRB G given in the same message.  
3.6.2.2.2  For the LRBG the following requirements have to be met:  
a) The on -board equipment shall use the last balise group passed as a reference 
when reporting its position to the RBC (in the following termed as LRBG ONB). Only  
 balise grou ps marked as linked and contained in the previously received linking 
information, if linking information is used on -board  
 or  
 the last balise group not marked as unlinked, if no linking was used when this 
balise group was passed  
shall be regarded.  
b) The RBC  shall use a balise group which was reported by the on -board equipment 
as a reference (in the following termed as LRBG RBC). At a certain moment LRBG RBC 
and LRBG ONB can be different.  
c) The on -board equipment shall be able to accept information referring to on e of at 
least eight LRBG ONB last reported to the RBC.  
3.6.2.2.2.1  Exception  to a) : When on -board position is unknown or when position data has 
been deleted during SoM procedure , the on -board equipment shall use an LRBG 
identifier set to "unknown" until the onboard has  validated its position again by passing 
a balise group .

 3.6.2.2.2.2  Exception to b): When the RBC has received from the onboard an unknown position  
(as per 3.6.2.2.2.1)  or during SoM procedure an invalid position which it is not able to 
confirm, the RBC shall use an LRBG identifier set to "unknown" until it receives a 
position report from the onboard having validated its position by passing a balise 
group.  
3.6.2.2.2.3  Regarding c):  From the time it has reported an unknown position, or an  invalid 
position during SoM procedure, to the time it has received from the RBC a message 
with an LRBG not set to “unknown”, the on -board equipment shall also be able to 
accept messages from the RBC containing LRBG “unknown” .

b)). 
3.6.2.3  Data transmitted as Infill information  
3.6.2.3.1  All location and profile data transmitted as infill information  shall refer to the location 
reference of the balise group at the next main signal (identified by the i nfill information) 
and to the orientation given by the infill device. (See note after justification).

 3.6.2.4.1  It shall be possible to transmit non -infill location data by loop, which refers to a balise 
group as location reference.  
3.6.2.4.1.1  Note: Regarding infill infor mation see section 3.6.2.3.  
3.6.2.4.2  The orientation of data transmitted by a loop is determined by the EOLM information 
which indicates how the directional information contained in loop messages is to be 
interpreted.  
3.6.3  Validity direction of transmitted Information  
3.6.3.1  General  
3.6.3.1.1  The direction for which transmitted information is valid shall refer to:  
a) the direction of the LRBG for information sent by radio  
b) the direction of the balise group sending the information.  
3.6.3.1.2  Data transmitted to the on -board equipment (by balise or radi o) shall be identified as 
being valid for  
a) both directions  
b) the nominal direction  
c) the reverse direction  
of the referenced balise group.  
3.6.3.1.2.1  Deleted.  
3.6.3.1.3  When receiving information from any transmission medium, the ERTMS/ETCS  on-
board equipment shall only take into a ccount information valid for its orientation. Other 
information shall be ignored. Exception: for SL , PS  and SH engines, balise group 
crossing direction shall be considered.  
3.6.3.1.3.1  If the train position is unknown, data received from any transmission medium valid 
for one direction only (nominal or reverse) shall be rejected by the onboard equipment. 
Data valid for both directions shall be evaluated (see section 4.8).  
3.6.3.1.4  If no co -ordinate system has been assigned to a single balise group, data transmitted 
by trackside,  which refers to that balise group requiring the co -ordinate system to be 
known (i.e. all data which are only valid for one direction (nominal or reverse) ) shall be 
rejected by the ERTMS/ETCS  on-board equipment . Data valid for both directions shall 
be eval uated (see section 4.8).  
3.6.3.1.4.1  Exception: if not rejected due to balise group message consistency check (see 
3.16.2.4.4.1 and 3.16.2.5.1.1), data to be forwarded to a National System (see section 
3.15.6) shall be accepted. Justification: the co -ordinate system o f the balise group 
might be known to the National System by other means inherent to the National 
System itself .

includes train length delay, refer to 3.11.3.1.3).  
c) Distances shall be given as unsigned incremental values representing the distance

a) Distance to the start of each element (value(n) for length(n)) shall be given as 
unsigned incremental values , each increment representin g the distance between  
starts of element (n) and element (n -1). 
b) For distance (1) the previously received data (or initial data/default values, see 
section 3.7) shall be used.  
c) Each value (n) may represent a single value or a se t of data.  
d) Note: There is no relationship between length of element (n -1) and distance (n), i.e., 
elements may overlap.  
3.6.3.2.5  It shall be possible for the RBC to shift the location reference, e.g., after a change of 
train orientation or running direction.  
3.6.3.2.5.1  Justification: Refer to Figure 13. To make it possible to shift the location reference if

a) On-board over-reading amount and under -reading amount  (odometer accuracy plus 
the error in detection of  the balise group locati on reference)  
b) The location accuracy of the LRBG.

 3.6.4.2.2  Note: The confidence interval increases in relation to the distan ce travelled from the 
LRBG  depending on the accuracy of odometer equipment  until it is reset when another 
balise group becomes the LRBG . 
3.6.4.2.3  The value of the Location Accuracy shall be determined by Linking information if 
available, if not, by the correspondin g National Value, or the corresponding Default 
Value if the National Value is not applicable.  
3.6.4.3  When another balise group becomes the LRBG or when evaluating (see section 4.8) 
location related trackside information, which is referred to a previously received  balise 
group different from the LRBG, all the location related information shall be relocated by 
subtracting from the distances that are counted from the reference balise group of the 
location related information:  
a) the distance between the reference balise  group of the location related information 
and the LRBG, retrieved from linking information if it is available and it includes both 
the reference balise group and the LRBG, OR  
b) in all other cases, the estimated travelled distance between the reference balis e 
group of the location related information and the LRBG.  
3.6.4.3.1  Justification: it is always the trackside responsibility to provide linking in due course, 
knowing this rule; if the location related information is to be used in situations where 
linking is not pro vided (e.g. TSR transmitted by balise group marked as unlinked), the 
trackside can include provisions, if deemed necessary, when engineering the distance 
information .

 3.8 Movement authority  
3.8.1  Characteristics of a MA  
3.8.1.1  The following characteristics can be used in a Movement Authority (see Figure 17: 
Structure of an MA ): 
a) The End of Movemen t Authority is the location to which the train is authorised to 
move.  
b) When t he Target Speed at the End of Movement Authority is zero, the End of 
Movement Authority is called EOA (End of Authority) ; when the target speed is not 
zero, it is called the LOA ( Limit of Authority). This non zero target speed can be time 
limited.  
c) If no overlap exists, the Danger Point is a location beyond the End of Movement 
Authority  that can be reached by the front end of the train without a risk for a 
hazardous situation.  
d) The e nd of an overlap (if used in the existing interlocking system) is a location 
beyond the Danger Point that  can be reached by the front end of the train without a 
risk for a hazardous situation. This additional distance is only valid for a defined 
time.  
e) A release speed is a speed limit under which the train is allowed to run in the vicinity 
of the End of Movement Authority , when the target speed is zero. One release 
speed can be associated with the Danger Point, and another one with the overlap. 
Release speed  can also be calculated on -board the train (see section 3.13.9.4 ). 
f) The MA can be split into several sections, The last one is called End Section.  
 A first time -out value can be attached to each section. This value will be used f or 
the revocation of the associated route when the train has not entered into it yet. It is 
called the Section time -out.  
 In addition, a second time -out value can be attached to the End Section of the 
MA. This second time -out will be used for the revocatio n of the last section when it 
is occupied by the train; it is called the End Section time -out. 
3.8.1.2  The values of the time -outs possibly given in an MA shall take into account the time 
elapsed from the start of validity of information to the sending of the mess age. 
3.8.1.3  Note: A Danger Point can be (not exhaustive list):  
 the entry point of an occupied block section (if the line is operated according to 
fixed block principles)  
 the position of the safe rear end of a train (if the line is operated according to 
moving blo ck principles)  
ERA * UNISIG * EEIG ERTMS USERS GROUP  
 
 
SUBSET -026-3 
3.6.0  
13/05/2016  System Requirements Specification  
Chapter 3  
Principles  Page 49/204 
  the fouling point of a switch, positioned for a route, conflicting with the current 
direction of movement of the train (both for fixed and moving block mode of 
operation)  
3.8.1.4  Note: Traditionally the overlap is a piece of track (beyond the danger  point), that is put 
at disposal of a train, to guarantee a non hazardous situation, also in case the driver 
should misjudge the stopping distance for the train. In ERTMS/ETCS the overlap can 
be used to improve the efficiency of the braking supervision.  
3.8.1.5  Note: Time -out values can be given in the MA to cope with the following situations 
depending on the interlocking operations, i.e. the timers on -board will only reflect the 
situation trackside and when expired (on -board) the actions taken are restrictive:  
a) Section time -out or time -out for the speed at the LOA: When a signalman requests 
a route release of a part of a route not yet entered by the approaching train.  
b) End Section time -out: When the train has entered the last part of a route, the 
automatic route rele ase can be delayed to make sure that the train has come to a 
standstill before any switches inside the route can be moved.  
c) Time -out for an overlap: When the train has entered the last part of a route, the 
overlap associated with the route remains valid for  a certain time to make sure that 
the train has successfully stopped before its End of Movement A uthority. If the 
overlap is still unoccupied when the timer expires the interlocking revokes the 
overlap.  
3.8.1.6  Note:  If the trackside equipment does not have enough  information to give the distance 
to the End of Movement Authority with a target speed equal to zero , a target speed 
higher than zero can be given (LOA, Limit of Authority). It is the responsibility of the 
trackside to ensure that the safe distance beyond the LOA is long enough to brake the 
train from the target speed to a stand still without any hazardous situation. It is the 
responsibility of the on -board equipment to apply the brakes if no new information is 
received when the Limit of Authority is passed .  
3.8.2  MA request to the RBC  
3.8.2.1  It shall be possible for the on -board equipment to request a new M ovement Authority 
from the RBC.  
3.8.2.2  The parameters for requesting a ne w MA shall be given by the RBC.  
3.8.2.3  In level 2/3, the following possibilities shall be available:  
a) A def ined time before the train reaches the perturb ation location  assuming it is 
running at the warning speed  (see section 3.13. 11 for details) . 
b) A defined time before the Section timer (not the End Section timer, not the Overlap 
timer) for any section of the MA  expires , or before the LOA speed timer expires .

description is deleted according to A .3.4, except for situations a, b, f, k.  
3.8.2.8  Together with the MA request the on -board shall inform the RBC about the reason(s) 
why the MA request is sent:  
a) Start selection by driver,  
b) Time before reaching perturb ation l ocation  reached,  
c) Time before a section timer or the L OA speed timer expires reached,  
d) The track description has been deleted , 
e) Track ahead free up to level 2/3 transition location . 
3.8.3  Structure of a Movement Authority (MA)  
3.8.3.1  The distance to the End of Movement Authority can be composed of several sections.  
3.8.3.2  For each section composing the MA the following information shall be given;  
a) Length of the section  
b) Optionally, Section time -out value and distance from beginning of section to Se ction 
timer stop location  
3.8.3.3  In addition, it shall be possible to define for  the End Section of the MA :

3.8.3.3.1  Note: If only one section is given in the MA it is regarded as the End Section.  
3.8.3.4  The Section timer stop location shall be inside of the corresponding section.  
3.8.3.4.1  Note: the End Section and Ove rlap timer start locations may be outside their 
corresponding section. One example can be seen referring to figure 22c: An infill MA 
towards a signal at stop will replace the previous End Section by a new short End 
Section starting at the infill location r eference and ending at the next main signal, 
however the End Section and Overlap timer start locations still have to be consistent 
with the Interlocking timer start locations. Another example is when a timer start 
location is in rear of the LRBG.  
3.8.3.5  In level 3, no time -outs shall be used.  
3.8.3.5.1  Note: For level 3 functionality the split of responsibility between the RBC and the 
Interlocking has to be considered. Time -out of routes and related overlap can not be 
based on train position reports since the position repor t can be delayed compared to

 the real position of the train. The route release and revocation of routes can not be 
carried out by the interlocking until permitted by the RBC.  
3.8.3.6  When an MA is transmitted by a balise group, the length of the first section shal l refer 
to the balise co -ordinate system of that balise group.  
3.8.3.7  In case a main signal is at danger in level 1, the first section shall give the distance 
from the balise group at the main signal to the location of the main signal, i.e. the 
distance to EOA is  given. Where available, information concerning danger point and 
overlap for this EOA may also be given.  
3.8.3.7.1  Justification: The balise group is not necessarily placed at the same location as the 
signal and thus an infill message (which includes the same infor mation as the balise 
group at the main signal) could change the location of the EOA to a position closer to 
the train.  
3.8.3.8  Note: In case the main signal is at danger in level 1, the on -board will supervise the 
given distance (specified in section 3.8.3.7 ) as the distance to EOA.  
3.8.3.9  When an MA is transmitted by radio from the RBC, the length of the first section shall 
refer to the balise co -ordinate system of the LRBG given in the same message.  
3.8.3.10  It shall be possible to give the length o f a section to any location in the track.  
3.8.3.10.1  Note: A section can cover several blocks and is not restricted to block ends (see

3.8.4.1  End Section Time -Out 
3.8.4.1.1  The End Section timer shall be started on -board when the train passes the End 
Section timer start location given by t rackside with its max safe front end.  
3.8.4.1.2  When the End Section timer value becomes greater than the time -out value given by 
trackside, the following shall apply:  
a) The EOA/LOA shall be withdrawn to the current position of the train . Refer to 
appendix A.3.4 for t he exhaustive list of location based information stored on -board, 
which shall be deleted accordingly ; 
b) if any,  a non zero target speed value at the End of Movement Authority  shall be set 
to zero  (i.e. an  LOA at the End of Movement Authority becomes an EOA w ithdrawn 
to the current position of the train) . 
3.8.4.1.3  In case no End Section timer is running when the on -board receives a new MA with an 
End Section timer start location in rear of the max safe front end of the train, the on -
board shall consider that the End Se ction timer value became greater than its time -out 
value and apply 3.8.4.1.2 .

 3.8.4.1.3.1  Justification: in this case the train is already beyond the timer start location, 
therefore it is impossible to determine when that location was crossed and so what 
share of the time-out value has elapsed since the crossing event. The safe assumption 
is to consider that the time -out value has been exceeded and therefore that the End 
Section will soon be released by the Interlocking.  
3.8.4.1.4  In case an End Section timer is already running when the on -board receives a new MA 
with an End Section timer start location in rear of the max safe front end of the train, 
the on -board shall keep the End Section timer running but replace the time -out value 
with the value received with the new MA.  
3.8.4.1.4.1  Justification: this allows repetition of the MA via RBC (e.g. acknowledgment of 
current MA was lost) without unintentionally affecting the End Section timer.  
3.8.4.2  Section Time -Outs  
3.8.4.2.1  The on -board shall start a Section timer for each section:  
a) For Level 2: at the value of the time stamp of the message including the MA.  
b) For Level 1: at the time of passage over the first encountered balise of the balise 
group giving the MA.  
3.8.4.2.1.1  Justification for b): This is to ensure that the timer is always started before or at the 
same time as the related variable information is received. Thus the timer start is 
independent of in which balise the variable information is given.  
3.8.4.2.2  When a Section timer value becomes greater than the time -out value given by 
trackside , the following shall apply:  
a) the EOA /LOA and the SvL shall be withdrawn to the entry point of the revoked 
section . Refer to appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of location based information 
stored on -board, which shall be deleted accordingly ; 
b) the National/ Default Value of the Releas e Speed shall apply ;  
c) if any, a non zero target speed value at the End of Movement  Authority  shall be set 
to zero  (i.e. a n LOA at the End of Movement  Authority becomes an EOA withdrawn 
to the entry point of the revoked section ). 
3.8.4.2.2.1  Intentionally deleted.  
3.8.4.2.3  The Section timer shall be stopped when the min safe front end of the train has passed

3.8.4.3.1  The on -board shall start a timer for the  LOA speed:

 b) For Level 1: at the time of passage over the first encountered balise of the balise 
group giving the MA.  
3.8.4.3.1.1  Justification for b): This is to ensure that the timer is alwa ys started before or at the 
same time as the related variable information is received. Thus the timer start is 
independent of in which balise the variable information is given.  
3.8.4.3.2  When the LOA speed timer value becomes greater than the time-out value given by  
trackside , the speed associated with the LOA shall be set to zero (i.e. the Limit of 
Authority becomes an End of Authority  and the SvL  is defined on -board according to 
3.8.4.5) . Refer to appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of location based information  
stored on -board, which shall be deleted accordingly.  
3.8.4.4  Time -out of Overlap  
3.8.4.4.1  The Overlap timer shall be started on -board when the train passes the Overlap timer 
start location given by trackside with its max safe front end.  The timer shall be 
considered as st arted even if a time -out value “infinite” is given.  
3.8.4.4.2  When the Overl ap timer value becomes greater than the time -out value given by 
trackside, the following shall apply:  
a) the overlap information shall be deleted  and the Supervised Location shall be  
determined  in accordance with 3.8.4. 5. Refer to appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive 
list of location based information stored on -board, which shall be deleted 
accordingly.  
b) the release speed associated with the Overlap shall be deleted  
c) if any, a non zero target speed v alue at the End of Movement Authority  shall be set 
to zero  (i.e. a n LOA at the End of Movement  Authority becomes an EOA) . 
3.8.4.4.3  If the train comes to a standstill after the Overlap timer has been started, the on-board 
shall consider that the Overlap timer value became greater than its time -out value and 
shall apply 3.8.4.4.2 . 
3.8.4.4.4  In case no Overlap timer is running when the on -board receives a new MA with an 
Overlap timer start location in rear of the max safe front end of the train, the on -board 
shall consider that the Overlap timer value became greater than its time-out value  and 
shall apply 3.8.4.4.2.  
3.8.4.4.4.1  Justification: in this case the train is already beyond the timer start location, 
therefore it is impossible to determine when that location was crossed and so what 
share of the time -out value has elapsed since the crossing event. The safe assumption 
is to consider that the time -out value has been exceeded a nd therefore that the 
Overlap will soon be released by the Interlocking.

 board shall keep the Overlap timer running but replace the Overlap time-out value with 
the value received with the new MA.  
3.8.4.4.5.1  Justification: this allows repetition of the MA via RBC (e.g. acknowledgment of 
current MA was lost) without unintentionally affecting the Overlap timer.  
3.8.4.5  Supervised Location  
3.8.4.5.1  The Supervised Location  (SvL) shall be defined on -board as : 
a) the end of overlap (if any and before time -out). 
b) if not, the Danger Point (if any).  
c) if not, the End Of Authority.  
3.8.4.5.2  As long as a Limit of Authority is supervised, no SvL shall be defined on -board.  
3.8.4.6  Infill MA (level 1 only)  
3.8.4.6.1  An MA given by an infill device is called an infill MA.  
3.8.4.6.2  An infill MA shall be evaluated on -board only if the on -board equipment is in FS or LS 
mode.  
3.8.4.6.3  The infill information shall include the identity of the balise group at the next main 
signal i.e. the identity of the balise group giving the information that is tra nsmitted in 
advance by the infill device.  
3.8.4.6.4  An infill MA shall be evaluated on -board only if the linking information, regarding the 
main signal balise group to which it refers, is available.  
3.8.4.6.5  The on -board shall start a Section timer for each section beyond th e next main signal:  
a) When the infill information is received from a balise group at the time of passing the 
first encountered balise of the infill balise group.  
b) When the infill information is received from a loop at the time of receiving the loop 
message . 
c) When the infill information is received from a radio infill unit at the value of the time 
stamp of the radio infill message including the MA.  
3.8.5  MA Update  
3.8.5.1  A new MA shall replace a previously received  MA in the following ways : 
a) When the new MA is given from a ba lise group at a main signal (i.e. not infill 
information) or from the RBC all data included in the previous MA shall be replaced 
by the new data.  
b) When the new MA is given as infill information all data beyond the announced balise 
group at the next main si gnal shall be replaced.

 3.8.5.1.1  Note: This refers to all information included in the MA as listed in section 3.8.1.1  and 
the Signalling related speed restriction (see section 3.11.6 ). 
3.8.5.1.2  When an infill MA is r eceived, the on -board shall start a new MA section at the infill 
location reference, i.e. the balise group at the next main signal (see 3.6.2.3.1).  
3.8.5.1.3  If the SvL defined from the new MA is closer than the one supervised with the former 
MA, this shall be consi dered by the on -board equipment as an MA shortening. Refer to 
appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of location based information stored on -board, 
which shall be deleted accordingly.  
3.8.5.1.4  If a new MA defines an SvL while the on -board was supervising an LOA, th is shall 
always be considered by the on -board equipment as an MA shortening regardless of 
the SvL location. Refer to appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of location based 
information stored on -board, which shall be deleted accordingly.  
3.8.5.2  It shall be possi ble to update the length of an MA  section by means of repositioning 
information contained in a balise group message (see section 3.8.5.3 ). 
3.8.5.2.1  Note: The concerned MA  section need not be the end section.  
3.8.5.2.2  Upon reception of reposition ing information and only  if linking information has 
announced a following balise group as unknown but containing repositioning 
information , the on -board shall update the length of the current MA section in which the 
train front end is . 
3.8.5.2.3  A balise group messa ge containing a movement authority shall not contain 
repositioning information for the same direction.  
3.8.5.2.3.1  Note: It is possible to combine repositioning with an infill MA.  
3.8.5.2.4  The reception of repositioning information or of a new MA with an LOA shall not be

 If it is in rear , the on -board equipment shall accept the new MA. 
 If it is in advance , the request shall be rejected and the previously received MA 
remains valid  
c) The RBC shall be informed about the d ecision.  
3.8.6.2  If the request from the RBC is granted by the on -board, refer to appendix A.3.4 for the 
exhaustive list of location based information, which shall be deleted accordingly.  
3.9 Means to transmit Infill information (Level 1 only)  
3.9.1  General  
3.9.1.1  It shall be poss ible to transmit infill information to the on -board equipment using  
a) Balise groups  
b) Euroloops  
c) Radio infill units.  
3.9.1.1.1  If the information transmitted by Balise groups, Euroloops, and Radio includes infill 
information , those devices are al so identified as infill d evices.  
3.9.1.2  The principle used for the infill information shall be the same independent of 
transmission media.  
3.9.1.3  If the on -board system is not equipped with the infill transmission media as requested 
by the announcement balise group, the announcement information  shall be ignored by 
the on -board equipment and the train shall proceed according to the previously 
received information.  
3.9.1.4  Note: No additional description is needed for infill by balise group (other than already 
covered in previous chapters).  
3.9.2  Infill by loo p 
3.9.2.1  An End Of Loop Marker (EOLM) is by definition a device to mark the beginning or the 
end of a loop. When receiving this information, the on -board equipment knows that it is 
entering/leaving a track equipped with a loop. In unidirectional applications it is 
possible to have an EOLM only at the entry side of a loop.  
3.9.2.2  Balise groups shall be used as EOLMs. They act as an EOLM by sending the EOLM 
information to the passing train.  
3.9.2.3  EOLMs have an orientation that is identical to the balise group orientation. The g eneral 
rules for balise orientation therefore also apply to EOLMs.

 3.9.2.4  EOLM information might be contained in a balise group that contains other information.  
3.9.2.5  The EOLM shall send the identity of the announced loop.  
3.9.2.6  The on -board shall only accept information c oming from the loop with the announced 
identity.  
3.9.2.7  Deleted.  
3.9.2.8  Deleted.  
3.9.2.9  The following information shall be sent in advance by the EOLM to prepare for 
reception of the loop information:  
 Loop identity used to identify the loop.  
 Key to select the spread spectru m key necessary to receive the loop telegrams.  
 Distance to the loop giving the distance from the EOLM to the location from where 
on loop messages can be received.  
 Length of the loop giving the length of the loop over which messages can be 
received.  
 Indic ator telling the on -board whether the orientation of the loop is identical or 
reverse to the orientation of the announcing EOLM.  
3.9.2.10  The on -board shall be prepared to receive messages from the Euroloop after passing 
the EOLM.  
3.9.2.11  When the on -board equipment reads  the next main signal balise group or when it 
detects that the next main signal balise group was missed, new infill information 
possibly received from the loop shall be ignored.  
3.9.2.12  The distances given in an EOLM (distance to loop, length of loop) are used for  
diagnostic purpose only. They shall therefore not be used to restrict reception of loop 
telegrams to specific locations.  
3.9.3  Infill by radio  
3.9.3.1  In level 1 areas it shall be possible to send to the on -board equipment orders to 
establish/terminate a communication session with a radio infill unit.  
3.9.3.2  The orders shall be sent via balise groups  or via Radio Infill units . 
3.9.3.3  The order to establish a communication session shall be ignored:  
a) Intentionally deleted .  
b) If the on -board equipment does not include radio.  
3.9.3.4  If the on -board equipment includes radio, the communication session shall be 
established using the same protocols and interfaces as for Level 2/3 operations.

a) If only one RIU communication session is ongoing , maintain the existing 
communication session and establish a  new one with the RIU indicated in the order . 
b) If two RIU communication session s are ongoing, maintain  the communication 
session related to the curr ent infill area,  terminate  the other one and establish a  new

session, the order shall be ignored.  
3.9.3.7  A Radio Infill Unit shall not initi ate a communication session with an on -board 
equipment.  
3.9.3.8  The order to establish/terminate a communication session sent via balise groups shall 
be sent together with the following radio infill area information:  
a) Location where to perform the action (referred to the balise group containing the 
order). Note: if the action is to establish a communication session, this location 
marks the beginning of the Radio Infill Area.  
b) Next main signal balise group identifier ( ignored by the on -board  if the action is 
Terminate communication session). Note: the reference location of this balise group 
marks the end of the Radio Infill Area.  
3.9.3.8.1  The order to establish/terminate a communication session sent via Radio Infill units 
(see 3.5.3.6) shall not be sent together with any radio in fill area information.  
3.9.3.9  The establishment of a communication session for radio infill shall not change the 
operational level of the on -board i.e. the information in the balise group shall be taken 
into account as usual in level 1.

b) As soon as the next main signal balise group indicated in the order sent via balise 
groups is read  or the on -board equipment detects that it was missed.  
3.9.3.11  The information sent to the radio infill unit by the on -board equipment shall include  
a) Train identity (ETCS -ID of the on -board equipment)  
b) Position report  
c) Identifier of the next main signal balise group  
d) Time stamp  
3.9.3.11.1  Justification:  
a) The train identity is used for conformity with other train to track messages  
b) The identifier of the next main signal balise group allows the radio infill unit to 
identify safely where the train is going, even in the case of a poi nts area  
3.9.3.12  As soon as the radio infill unit is informed that a train has entered an infill area  under  
its responsibility , it shall  
a) Terminate a possible previous sending of infill information to the on -board 
equipment , AND  
b) Send cyclically the infill informati on corresponding to the message currently sent by 
the next main signal balise group indicated in the information from the on -board 
equipment.  
3.9.3.12.1  Justification: case a) refers to the possibility that a report from the on -board equipment, 
after having passed t he previous main signal, was lost.

information is received, that the on -board equipment has read the next main signal 
balise group indicated in the order or that the on -board equipment has det ected that it 
was missed.  
3.9.3.14  The radio infill unit shall evaluate the time stamp according to the principles of section

 in Euroradio specification. Only  emergency messages can be sent as high priority 
data, not their acknowledgement or their revocation.  
3.10.1.1.1  Justification: In case of hazardous events, it is possible to use high priority data in the 
radio connection between RBC and on -board equipment to get a q uick reaction.  
3.10.1.2  An emergency message shall contain an identifier decided by the trackside.  
3.10.1.3  The same identifier shall be used in case the emergency message is repeated.  
3.10.1.3.1  If the on -board receives a new message with the same identifier it shall replace the 
previous one.  
3.10.1.4  Each emergency message to an on -board equipment shall be acknowledged, using 
the corresponding emergency message identification number.  
3.10.1.4.1  Note: This acknowledgement informs the RBC about the use of the emergency 
message by on -board equipment and i s independent from the general 
acknowledgement for track -to-train messages, as  specified in section 3.16.3.5.  
3.10.2  Emergency Stop  
3.10.2.1  It shall be possible to stop a train with a conditional or an unconditional emergency 
stop message.  
3.10.2.2  A conditional emergency stop message shall contain the information of a new stop 
location, referred to the LRBG.  In case, when receiving this message  
 the train has already passed with its min safe front end the new stop location, the 
emergency stop message shall be rejected and the RB C shall be informed.  
 the train has not yet passed with its min safe front end the new stop location, the 
emergency stop message shall be accepted, however this location shall be used by 
the onboard to define a new EOA /SvL only if not beyond the current E OA/LOA . 
Refer to appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of location based information stored 
on-board, which shall be deleted accordingly . 
3.10.2.3  When receiving an unconditional emergency stop message the train shall be tripped 
immediately.

3.11 Static Speed Restrictions and Gradients  
3.11.1  Introduction  
3.11.1.1  The permitted speed at which the train is allowed to travel shall be limited to different 
kinds of St atic Speed Restrictions.  
3.11.1.2  A Static Speed Restriction shall be handled in the same way independent of ETCS 
level.  
3.11.2  Definition of Static Speed Restriction  
3.11.2.1  Static Speed Restrictions are imposed by the trackside infrastructure, the train 
characteristics, the sig nalling and the mode of the on -board equipment.  
3.11.2.2  There are eleven  categories of Static Speed Restrictions:   
a) Static Speed Profile (SSP)  
b) Axle load Speed Profile (ASP)  
c) Temporary Speed Restrictions (TSR)  
d) Maximum Train Speed  
e) Signalling related speed restriction  (only level 1)  
f) Mode related Speed Restriction.  
g) STM Max speed (for details refer to Subset -035) 
h) STM System speed (for details refer to Subset -035) 
i) Level Crossing  speed restriction  (LX SR)  
j) Override function related Speed Restriction  
k) Speed restriction to ens ure a given permitted braking distance (PBD SR) (see 
3.11.11)  
3.11.2.3  The Static Speed Restriction categories are independent of each other. This means 
that one speed restriction category cannot affect, nor be affected by, any other 
category of Static Speed Restri ctions.

3.11.3  Static Speed Profile (SSP)  
3.11.3.1.1  The Static Speed Profile (SSP) is a description of the fixed spee d restrictions of a 
given piece of track. The speed restrictions can be related to e.g. maximum line speed, 
curves, points, tunnel profiles, bridges.  
3.11.3.1.2  The Static Speed Profile is based on factors, which are both track and train dependent. 
The relationship b etween track and train characteristics determine s the individual 
Static Speed Profile for each train.  
3.11.3.1.3  It shall be possible for every element (distance between two discontinuities) of a static 
speed profile to define, if a transition to a higher speed limi t than the speed limit 
specified for this element is permitted before the complete train has left the element.  
3.11.3.2  Static Speed Profile Categories  
3.11.3.2.1  It shall be possible to transmit  several  Static Speed Profile Categories; one Basic SSP 
category and specific SSP  categories related to the international train categories.  
3.11.3.2.1.1  The specific SSP categories are decomposed into two types:

 a) The “Cant Deficiency” SSP categories: the cant deficiency value assigned to one 
category shall define the maximum speed, determined by sus pension design, at 
which a particular train can traverse a curve and thus can be used to set a specific 
speed limit in a curve with regards to this category.  
b) The “other specific” SSP categories: it groups all other specific SSP categories 
corresponding to the other international train categories  
3.11.3.2.1.2  Whenever the type of specific SSP category is not explicitly specified in the 
following requirements, it shall be interpreted as being applicable for both types of 
specific SSP categories.  
3.11.3.2.2  For each part of the Stati c Speed Profile, the ERTMS/ETCS trackside shall:  
a) always give the Basic SSP, which shall be considered as the default “Cant 
Deficiency” SSP  
b) optionally give one or more specific SSPs  
c) specify, for each “other specific” SSP, whether it replaces or not the “Can t 
Deficiency” SSP as selected by the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment according to 
3.11.3.2.3  
3.11.3.2.3  For each part of the Static Speed Profile, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall 
select the SSP best suiting its “Cant Deficiency” train category, according to the  
following order of preference:  
a) if available, the “Cant Deficiency” SSP matching its “Cant Deficiency” train category, 
OR 
b) if available, the “Cant Deficiency” SSP with the highest Cant Deficiency value below 
the value of its “Cant Deficiency” train category , OR

train belonging to at lea st one or more “other international” train categories shall use 
the most restrictive speed amongst:  
a) the ” Cant Deficiency” SSP as selected in 3.11.3.2.3, only if none of the “other 
specific” SSP categories matching the train categories replaces the ” Cant 
Deficiency” SSP, AND  
b) all the “other specific ” SSP categories matching the “other international” train 
categories.

 3.11.3.3.1  A maximum of 31 train categories is defined to match the SSP categories. 16 “Cant 
Deficiency”  train categor ies and 15 “other international”  train categories.  
3.11.3.3.2  A train shall always belong to one and only one “Cant Deficiency”  train category  and 
may optionally belong to one or more “other international” train categor ies. 
3.11.3.3.3  The train categor y(ies) to which a train belongs is a part of  its Train Data.  
3.11.4  Axle load Speed Profile  
3.11.4.1  It shall be possible to define an Axle load Speed Profile as a non -continuous profile.  
3.11.4.2  For each section with a speed restriction due to axle load, the different speed value(s) 
and for which minimum axle load categor y this speed value(s) applies shall be 
specified.  
3.11.4.2.1  Note: Different speed restrictions depending on the axle load category  can be 
applicable to the same distance.  
3.11.4.3  The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment  shall consider the most restrictive speed 
restriction that is associated with any axle load category  lower  than, or equal to that of 
the train.  
3.11.4.4  For t rains with an axle load category lower than the minimum axle load category given 
in the profile , the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment  shall not consider any speed 
restrict ion due to axle load.  
3.11.4.5  The initial state for Axle load Speed Profile shall be “no restriction due to axle load”.  
3.11.4.6  Whether a speed increase after the axle load speed restriction shall be delayed with 
train length, shall be determined by the axle load speed pr ofile information sent to the 
on-board equipment.  
3.11.5  Temporary Speed Restrictions  
3.11.5.1  The temporary speed restriction is defined in order to enable a separate category of 
track infrastructure speed restriction, which can be used for working areas etc.  
3.11.5.2  All Tempora ry Speed Restrictions are independent of each other. This means that an 
individual Temporary Speed Restriction cannot affect, nor be affected by, any other 
individu al Temporary Speed Restriction.  
3.11.5.3  Whether a speed increase after the temporary speed restricti on shall be delayed with 
train length, shall be determined by the temporary speed restriction information sent to 
the on -board equipment.  
3.11.5.4  When two or more temporary speed restrictions overlap, the most restrictive speed of 
the overlapping temporary speed r estrictions shall be used in the area of overlap.

 3.11.5.5  Each Temporary Speed Restriction shall have an identity to make it possible to revoke 
the Temporary Speed Restriction using its identity. The speed restriction shall be 
revoked immediately when revocation i s received from trackside, without delay for the 
train length.  
3.11.5.6  It shall be possible to identify whether a Temporary Speed Restriction is possible to 
revoke or not.  
3.11.5.7  A new Temporary Speed Restriction shall not replace a previously received Temporary 
Speed Re striction with another identity.  
3.11.5.8  Temporary Speed Restrictions shall only be revoked on request from the trackside.  
3.11.5.9  If the on -board equipment receives a new Temporary Speed Restriction (TSR) with the 
same identity as an already received TSR, the new Tempo rary Speed Restriction shall 
replace the previous one, except when the Temporary Speed Restriction is identified 
as non revocable in which case this shall be considered as an additional TSR.  
3.11.5.10  In case the train has changed its orientation any Temporary Speed  Restriction shall be 
deleted (operational requirement: will be executed due to the mode change).  
3.11.5.11  Intentionally deleted.  
3.11.5.12  It shall be possible for the RBC to order an ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment in Level 
2 or 3 to reject revocable TSRs from balises.  
3.11.5.13  When ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment has accepted an order to reject revocable 
TSRs from balises, this inhibition shall be stored and shall be effective immediately, 
but only for revocable TSRs received from balises thereafter.  
3.11.5.14  The inhibition of revocable TSRs f rom balises  shall be deleted if any of the following 
occurs:  
 the communication session established with the RBC that ordered the inhibition is 
terminated, OR  
 in case of RBC/RBC handover, the train front end crosses the RBC/RBC border.  
3.11.5.15  Note: this inhibition  may be useful in Level 1 / Level 2 mixed signalling applications 
when the RBC has more precise information about restrictions than can be given from

account from the location reference of the balis e group at the next main signal.  
3.11.6.3  The speed restriction shall be valid until a new signalling related speed restriction is

3.11.6.4  In case of a signal at danger the signalling related speed restriction shall have value  
zero, which shall be evaluated by the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment not as a 
speed limit but a s a train trip order.  
3.11.6.5  In case of infill information the signalling related speed restriction at zero shall be

 3.11.10  Override function related Speed Restriction  
3.11.10.1  While the “override” function is active, the override speed limit (national /default value) 
shall be taken into account.  
3.11.11  Speed restriction  to ensure permitted braking distance  
3.11.11.1  It shall be possible for trackside t o request the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment to 
calculate a speed restriction based on a permitted braking distance  given by trackside . 
3.11.11.2  The order shall be given by means of a non -continuous profile defining:  
 The start and end location for the speed restrict ion 
 The permitted braking distance (PBD) used to calculate the speed restriction value  
 Whether the permitted braking distance is to be achieved with the Service Brake or 
Emergency Brake  
 A single gradient value applicable for the calculation  
3.11.11.3  The speed restr iction shall be calculated when the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment 
receives the permitted braking distance information from trackside, and shall be re -
calculated only if any of the inputs taken into account for the calculation of the speed 
restriction chang es. 
3.11.11.4  The calculation of the speed restriction by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall 
take into account that : 
 The single gradient value received from trackside shall be compensated in value 
according to the rotating mass as defined in 3.13.4.3 . 
 The safe deceleration shall be computed as in 3.13.6.2.1 but without considering 
the adhesion profiles , the track conditions related to brake inhibition and the track 
conditions related to powerless section given by trackside.  
 The expected deceleration shall be com puted as in 3.13.6.3.1 but without 
considering the track conditions related to brake inhibition and the track conditions 
related to powerless section given by trackside . 
 The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall calculate an Emergency Brake 
Deceleration (EBD ) curve based on the safe deceleration and that reaches zero 
speed at a distance equal to the permitted braking distance . 
 If the permitted braking distance is to be achieved with the service brake, the 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall also calculate a S ervice Brake 
Deceleration (SBD) curve based on the expected deceleration and that reaches 
zero speed at a distance equal to the permitted braking distance . 
 The estimated acceleration shall be set to “zero”.  
 If not inhibited by National Value, the compensat ion of the inaccuracy of the speed 
measurement shall be set to a value calculated from the PBD speed, as defined in 
SUBSET -041 § 5.3.1.2: V_delta0PBD = f41(V_PBD + dV_EBI(V_PBD)) if the

 permitted braking distance is to be achieved with the emergency brake;  
V_delta0PBD = f41(V_PBD + dV_SBI(V_PBD))  if the permitted braking distance is 
to be achieved with the service brake . 
 The train will travel a distance from the last encountered balise of a group that 
provides restrictive information until initiating the br ake command. This travelled 
distance shall be set to a value calculated from the PBD speed considering a 
processing delay (T 41) equal to SUBSET -041 § 5.2.1.1.  
 Regardless of how the service brake feedback is actually configured (see 
3.13.2.2.7.2), T_bs1 and  T_bs2 (see 3.13.9.3.3) shall be defined as if the service 
brake feedback was not implemented . 
 Regardless of how the traction cut -off interface is actually configured (see 
3.13.2.2.8), T_traction (see 3.13.9.3.2) shall be defined as if the traction cut -off was 
not implemented.  
3.11.11.4.1  Note: Knowing how the PBD speed restriction is computed by the ERTMS/ETCS on -
board equipment, it is the responsibility of the trackside to set the appropriate 
permitted braking distance with regard to the risk of not initiating the br ake command 
in due time when encountering a further balise group providing restrictive information. 
In other words, if deemed necessary, the trackside can include provisions based on 
the characteristics of the balise group providing restrictive information  e.g. distances 
between balises in that group with regards to validity direction of transmitted 
information and balise group orientation, accuracy of balise location.  
3.11.11.4.2  Note: If the permitted braking distance is to be achieved with the service brake , it is the 
responsibility of the trackside to also consider an estimation of the on-board over-
reading and under -reading amounts at the time the brake command is initiated in order 
to lower the likelihood of the max safe front end of the train reaching the EBI 
supervision limit.  
3.11.11.5  Note: Throughout the following formulas, all the distances marked with “d” (lower case) 
are counted from a single arbitrary reference location.  
3.11.11.6  If the permitted braking distance is to be achieved with the emergency brake, the 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall seek the PBD speed restriction value 
(V_PBD) which satisfies the two following inequalities. The resulting value shall then 
be rounded down to the next lower multiple of 5km/h:

3.12.4.2  For OS and LS mode the mode profile define s the entry and the length of the On 
Sight /Limited Supervision  area. For SH mode the mode profile only defines the entry 
location to SH  mode, any length given shall be ignored by the on -board.  
3.12.4.3  On reception of a new MA (with or without Mode Profile ) the on -board equipment shall 
delete the current ly supervised  Mode Profile.  
3.12.4.3.1  Exception: When receiving a new MA by infill, any current ly superv ised Mode Profile 
shall be deleted  only beyond the reference location of the infill information . 
3.12.4.4  In case the mode profile information for shunting is overwritten by a new shunting 
profile, before the on -board equipment switches to SH mode, a previous list of balise 
groups for SH area shall be deleted or replaced by a new list of balise groups  for SH 
area.

3.12.5.1  It shall be possible for trackside to inform the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment 
about the conditions under which a Level Crossing (LX) must be passed.  
3.12.5.2  Each Level Crossing shall have an identity, so that all LX information is independent of 
each other. This means that an individual LX information cannot affect, nor be affected 
by, any other individual LX information.  
3.12.5.3  If the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment receives a new LX information with the same 
identity as an already received LX informat ion, the new LX information shall replace 
the previous one.  
3.12.5.4  Level Crossing information shall be given as profile data, corresponding to the LX  start 
location and the length of the LX area.  
3.12.5.5  Level Crossing information shall indicate whether the LX is protect ed or not.  
3.12.5.6  In case the LX is not protected, ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall be informed:  
a) at which speed the LX is allowed to be passed  
b) whether the stopping of the train in rear of the LX start location is required or not

3.13 Speed and distance monitoring  
3.13.1  Introduction  
3.13.1.1  The speed and distance monitoring is the supervision of the speed of the train versus 
its position, in order to ass ure that the train remains within the given speed and 
distance limits.  
3.13.1.1.1  Note: The speed and distance monitoring of the on -board can only assure this when 
the following necessary conditions are fulfilled:  
 Brake system of the train functions as specified  
 whee l/rail adhesion is sufficient for the required safe deceleration  
 Brake characteristics (and other Train related inputs ) are correctly entered into the 
on-board  
3.13.1.2  Note: The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment triggers brake commands and revokes 
them, it may also re ceive status information if the brakes are applied or released. 
However, it cannot be made responsible if brake control circuits outside the equipment 
fail. Also the way the brakes are released by the driver after a revocation of a brake 
command is an impl ementation issue.  
3.13.1.3  Figure 28 gives an overview of the main elements contributing to the speed and 
distance monitoring. These elements (inputs, functions and outputs) are detailed in the 
following chapters.

3.13.2  Inputs for speed and distance monitoring  
3.13.2.1  Introduction  
3.13.2.1.1  The traction / braking models, the brake position / brake percentage are used for the 
definition of the kinematic behaviour of the train after a servi ce brake command or an 
emergency brake command has been initiated.

 3.13.2.1.2  However, railway brakes have a statistical behaviour and braking distances vary within 
the typical distribution for a given condition. Correction factors are therefore 
incorporated for the speed and distance monitoring.  
3.13.2.1.3  The correction factors will allow obtaining, from the nominal emergency braking 
performance of the train, the minimum emergency braking performances that are 
required  for reference conditions set by trackside . 
3.13.2.2  Train related i nputs  
3.13.2.2.1  Introduction  
3.13.2.2.1.1  The train related inputs to be considered for the speed and distance monitoring are:  
a) Traction model  
b) Braking models (brake build up time and speed dependent deceleration) or brake 
percentage  
c) Brake position  
d) Special brakes  (interface config uration and status)  
e) Service brake (interface  configuration and application ) 
f) Traction cut -off interface  
g) On-board correction factors  
h) Nominal rotating mass  
i) Train length  
j) Fixed values related to speed and distance monitoring  
k)  Train related speed restriction (i. e. the maximum train speed)  
3.13.2.2.1.2  These  train related inputs are acquired as Train Data (see 3.18.3.2 items b) c) and 
d)), except:  
 the configuration of the special brakes, service brake and traction cut -off interfaces 
which are not affected by the Train Data acq uisition,  
 the service brake application and the special brakes statuses which are 
continuously acquired on the Train Interface,  
 the fixed values.  
3.13.2.2.1.3  The speed and distance monitoring shall use braking models acquired as Train 
Data, unless the brake percentage  is acquired as Train Data and the conversion model 
is applicable (see 3.13.3.2 for its validity limits) . 
3.13.2.2.2  Traction model  
3.13.2.2.2.1  The traction model shall be given as a step function as indicated in Figure 29. It 
shall desc ribe the time delay T_traction_cut_off from the traction cut -off command by

3.13.2.2.3.1  Speed Dependent Deceleration  
3.13.2.2.3.1.1  The deceleration due to braking shall be given as a step function of the speed.  
3.13.2.2.3.1.2  It shall be possible to define up to seven steps for each speed dependent 
deceleration model.  
3.13.2.2.3.1.3  Note: An example with 4 steps is given in Figure 30. A_brake(V) is calculated as 
follows:  
 A_brake = AD_0  when 0 ≤ speed ≤ V1  
 A_brake = AD_1  when V1 < speed ≤ V2  
 A_brake = AD_2  when V2 < speed ≤ V3

3.13.2.2.3.1.4  The last step o f A_brake(V)  shall by definition be considered as open ended, i.e. it 
has no upper speed limit.  
3.13.2.2.3.1.5  The model shall be applicable only after full build up of the braking effort (see a_full 
in Figure 31) 
3.13.2.2.3.1.6  The model shall be used for the  emergency brake nominal deceleration 
(A_brake_emergency(V)), for the full service brake deceleration (A_brake_service(V)) 
and for the normal service brake deceleration (A_brake_normal_service(V)).  
3.13.2.2.3.1.7  It shall be possible to define individual speed dependent deceleration models of 
A_brake_emergency(V) and A_brake_service(V)  for each combination of use of 
regenerative brake, eddy current brake and magnetic shoe brake.  
3.13.2.2.3.1.8  Note: Individual deceleration models may be equal, thereby avoiding the influence 
of a specifi c brake on A_brake_emergency(V) or A_brake_service(V). However, the 
choice to take into account or not the contribution of a specific brake for 
A_brake_emergency(V) or A_brake_service(V) is only rolling stock dependent, not an 
ETCS implementation issue.  
3.13.2.2.3.1.9  It shall be possible to define up to two sets of three models of 
A_brake_normal_service(V):  
a) one set applicable when the brake position is in “Freight train in G”  
b) one set applicable when the brake position is in “Passenger train in P” or “Freight 
train in P”  
3.13.2.2.3.1.10  A set of A_brake_normal_service(V) shall be defined as a function of the full 
service brake deceleration at zero speed, A_brake_service(V=0):  
If A_brake_service(V = 0)  A_SB01  
A_brake_normal_service(V) = A_brake_normal_service_0(V)  
if A_SB01 < A_brake_ser vice(V = 0)  A_SB12  
A_brake_normal_service(V) = A_brake_normal_service_1(V)  
if A_SB12 < A_brake_service (V = 0)  
A_brake_normal_service(V) = A_brake_normal_service_2(V)  
3.13.2.2.3.1.11  Note: the two pivot values A_SB01 and A_SB12 are part of the 
A_brake_normal_service mod el, i.e. they are train related input data for the speed and

 3.13.2.2.3.2.1  The deceleration A_brake is not available immediately after the on -board 
commands the brake. There is a time lag between brake command and the st art of the 
brake force build -up. There is also time needed to build up the full brake force.

Figure 31: Brake Build Up Time Model  
3.13.2.2.3.2.3  In Figure 31, the following time intervals are defined:  
a) T_brake_react (t0…t1) is the interval between the command of the brake by the on -
board and the moment the brake force star ts to build up.  
b) T_brake_increase (t1...t2) is the interval in which the brake force increases from the 
zero to the moment when 95% of full brake power is reached.  
c) T_brake_build_up (t0...t3) is the equivalent brake build up time.  
3.13.2.2.3.2.4  The equivalent brake build up time (T_brake_build_up) is defined as 
T_brake_build_up = T_brake_react + 0.5*T_brake_increase.  
3.13.2.2.3.2.5  This model for T_brake_build_up shall be used for the emergency brake 
(T_brake_emergency) and for the full service brake (T_brake_service).  
3.13.2.2.3.2.6  Note: The equivale nt brake build up time is a safe approximation. In the beginning 
of the build -up time the model assumes a smaller deceleration, in the later part this is 
compensated by a higher deceleration.  
3.13.2.2.3.2.7  Note: T_brake_react and T_brake_increase are indicated in Figure 31 for 
completeness reasons; only T_brake_build_up is to be considered as an input for the 
speed and distance monitoring function.  
3.13.2.2.3.2.8  It shall be possible to define individual values of T_brake_emergency and 
T_brake_service for each  combination of use of regenerative brake, eddy current 
brake, magnetic shoe brake and  Ep brake .

T_brake_service is only rolling stock dependent, not an ETCS implementation issue.  
3.13.2.2.3.2.10  Note: In general, T_brake_emergency and T_brake_service are determined by 
the pneumatic br ake therefore avoiding to take into account of the influence of the 
regenerative brake, eddy current brake or magnetic shoe brake. However, if the 
Electro -pneumatic brake system is used, it is possible that T_brake_emergency and 
T_brake_service are determi ned by another special brake.  
3.13.2.2.4  Brake Position  
3.13.2.2.4.1  The brake position shall be set to one of the following three values:  
a) Passenger train in P  
b) Freight train in P  
c) Freight train in G  
3.13.2.2.4.2  Note: The brake position defines the behaviour of the brake for specific train typ es.

3.13.2.2.5.1  If the brake percentage is captured as Train Data and the conversion model is

A_brake_service(V), T_brake_emergency and T_brake_ servi ce.

shall not be influenced by the status of a special brake. However, the conversion 
model offer s the possibility that T_brake _service can be affected by the status of the 
regenerative brake, eddy current brake o r Ep brake (see A.3.9) . 
3.13.2.2.6.4  The on -board equipment shall be configured to define whether it is allowed to take 
into account the contribution of a special/additional brake, which is independent from 
wheel/rail adhesion, for the selection of the maximum emergency brake deceleration 
under reduced adhesion conditions (see 3.13.6.2.1.6 ). 
3.13.2.2.6.5  Note: the choice to set to “allowed” the contribution of such special/additional brake 
in the selection of the maximum emergency braking effort, is rolling stock dependent.  
3.13.2.2.6.6  If it is allowed to take into account the contribution of a special/additional brake, 
which is independ ent from wheel/rail adhesion, the speed and distance monitoring

special/additional brake to select the appropriate National Value under reduced 
adhesion conditions (see 3.13.2.3.7.7 ). 
3.13.2.2.7  Service brake  
3.13.2.2.7.1  The on -board shall be configured to define whether the service brake command is 
implemented or not, i.e. whether a service brake interface is implemented to command 
a full service brake effort.  
3.13.2.2.7.2  The on -board sh all be configured to define whether the service brake feedback is 
implemented or not, i.e. whether it is able to acquire from the service brake interface 
the information that the service brake is currently  applied.  
3.13.2.2.7.3  If the service brake feedback  is implemen ted and if not inhibited by National Value , 
the speed and distance monitoring function shall take into account either the main

 3.13.2.2.9.1.2  For each defined individual speed dependent deceleration model of 
A_brake_emergency(V) (i.e. corresponding to each combination of use of regenerative 
brake, eddy current bra ke and magnetic shoe brake), one set of rolling stock 
correction factors Kdry_rst(V, EBCL) and Kwet_rst(V) shall be defined in the on -board

3.13.2.2.9.1.3  For a given confidence level on emergency brake safe deceleration (EBCL), the 
rolling stock correction fa ctor Kdry_rst(V) shall be given as a step function of speed, 
with the same steps as the ones of A_brake_emergency(V).  
3.13.2.2.9.1.4  The confidence level on emergency brake safe deceleration represents the 
probability of the following individual event: the rolling stock emergency brake 
subsystem of the train does ensure a deceleration at least equal to 
A_brake_emergency(V) * Kdry_rst(V), when the emergency brake is commanded on 
dry rails.  
3.13.2.2.9.1.5  The rolling stock correction factor Kwet_rst(V) shall be given as a step function of  
speed, with the same steps as the ones of A_brake_emergency(V). It represents the 
loss of deceleration with regards to emergency braking on dry rails, when the 
emergency brake is commanded on wet rails, according to wheel/rail adhesion 
reference condition s.

3.13.3  Conversion Models  
3.13.3.1  Introduction  
3.13.3.1.1  For trains with variable composition (loco hauled trains), the brake characteristics can 
vary together with the composition of the train. In this case, it is not convenient to pre -
program the brake parameters necessary to calculate the braking curves. The only 
practical way to obtain the correct values for the current train composition is to include 
them in to the data entry process by the driver. However, it cannot be expected from 
the driver to know deceleration values and brake build up times. Conversion models 
are therefore defined to convert the parameters entered by the driver (brake 
percentage and brak e position) into the parameters of the corresponding brake model.  
3.13.3.1.2  Note: The process for defining the input parameters for the conversion model (brake 
percentage and brake position) is outside the scope of the ERTMS/ETCS 
specifications.  
3.13.3.2  Applicability of the  conversion models  
3.13.3.2.1  The conversion models shall be used by the on -board equipment if the brake 
percentage is acquired as part of Train Data, and if the maximum train speed, the 
brake percentage and the train length are all within the following validity limi ts of the 
conversion models:  
a) 0 ≤ V ≤ 200, where V is the maximum train speed in km/h  
b) 30 ≤ λ ≤ 250, where λ is the brake percentage in %  
c) 0 ≤ L ≤ Lmax , where L is the train length in m  and where Lmax = 900  m if the brake 
position is “Passenger train in P” or  Lmax = 1500  m if the brake position is “Freight 
train in P” or “Freight train in G”

 3.13.3.2.1.1  Note: The overspeed above the maximum train speed which may occur due to the 
ceiling speed margins is taken into account in the definition of the conversion model.  
3.13.3.2.2  For tra ins not fitting into at least one of those validity limits, it is still possible to acquire 
the brake percentage as Train Data, but the conversion models are not applicable, 
which means that braking models (i.e. pre -programmed deceleration profiles and 
brake build up times) shall be used by the speed and distance monitoring function . 
3.13.3.3  Brake percentage conversion model  
3.13.3.3.1  Input parameters

 3.13.4.1.2  The default gradient for TSR shall be compensated in value according to the rotating 
mass as defined in 3.13.4.3 . 
3.13.4.1.3  For all loca tions not covered by the gradient profile, the on -board shall consider the 
gradient value as:  
a) the default gradient for TSR, if available and if the concerned target is due to a TSR  
b) zero, for other cases.  
3.13.4.2  Train length compensation  
3.13.4.2.1  Assuming that a fictive tr ain front end would be at any location between the current 
(actual) train front end location and the SvL, the acceleration due to the gradient shall 
be determined using the lowest (taking the sign into account) gradient value given by 
the gradient profile between the location of the fictive train front end and the location of 
the fictive train rear end (see Figure 35). 
3.13.4.3  Rotating mass  
3.13.4.3.1  The influence of gradients shall be compensated for the rotating mass of the train (see 
Figure 35). 
3.13.4.3.1.1  Note: Since the rotating mass works like a flywheel (rotating inertia), the effect of 
the gradient is reduced. Assume for instance a (theoretical) train without any rotating 
mass, not braking, on a downhill gradient from height 1 to height 2. All the energy 
added to the train when it goes from H1 to H2 is converted into linear forward motion. 
This can be observed as an acceleration due to the gradient. Now assume the same 
train with part of the weight rotating. If this train travel s the same distance from H1 to 
H2, the same amount of energy is added to the train. But now a part of that energy is 
converted into rotational motion and only the remaining part is converted into linear 
forward motion. The latter can be observed as an acce leration which is less than for 
the train without rotating mass.  
3.13.4.3.1.2  Note: For the influence of the rotating mass on the deceleration due to the brake, it 
is already taken into account in the values for the brake parameters.  
3.13.4.3.2  The following formulas shall be use d: 
a) If M_rotating_nom is unknown:  
 Uphill: A_gradient = g * grad / (1000+10*M_rotating_max)  
 Downhill: A_gradient = g * grad / (1000+10*M_rotating_min)  
b) If M_rotating_nom is known:  
 Uphill: A_gradient = g * grad / (1000+10*M_rotating_nom)  
 Downhill: A_gradient =  g * grad / (1000+10*M_rotating_nom)

the contribution of this special brake.  
3.13.5.2.1  Note: in such case, a track condition profile implying the inhibition of this special brake 
will have no effect.  
3.13.5.3  From the adhesion profile given by trackside,  the on -board shall consider locations with 
reduced adhesion conditions over a distance going from the start location of the profile 
to the location derived by adding the train length to the end location of the profile.

model (see 3.13.3.4 ) using the brake position and train length acquired as Train 
Data.  
b) The integrated  correction factor Kt_in t, only if the conversion model is used  (see 
3.13.2.3.7 )

acquired as part of Train Data  
3.13.6.2.2.3  The safe brake build up time T_be shall be equal to:  
If values of T_brake_emergency are acquired  as part of Train Data:  
T_be = T_brake_emergency , with T_brake_emergency corresponding to the 
combination of special brakes currently in use

3.13.8.1  Introduction  
3.13.8.1.1  A target is defined by a target location and a target speed, to which the train must 
decelerate before reaching the target locatio n. 
3.13.8.1.2  For that purpose, the on -board equipment shall use brake deceleration curves related 
to the supervised targets, from the deceleration values as specified in sections 
3.13.6.2.1 , 3.13.6.3.1 and 3.13.6.4 . 
3.13.8.1.3  These deceleration values being speed and distance dependent, a brake deceleration 
curve shall be calculated piecewise, i.e. it shall be composed of interconnected arcs of

values  (see Figure 38). 
3.13.8.2  Determination of the supervised targets  
3.13.8.2.1  The on -board shall continuously supervise a list of targets, which may include the 
following types of target:  
a) the locations corresponding to a speed decrease of the MRSP (if any), which are in 
advance of the max safe front end of the train  
b) the Limit of Authority (LOA)  
c) the End of Authority (EOA) and the Supervised Location (SvL)  
d) the locati on deduced from the maximum permitted distance to run in Staff 
Responsible, with a target speed zero  
3.13.8.2.1.1  Note: depending on the information received from trackside and the position of the 
train, the list of supervised targets may be empty.  
3.13.8.2.2  The list of supervis ed targets shall be re -evaluated when any of the elements it is built 
of is changed (e.g. new MA and/or track description accepted on -board, EOA and/or 
SvL temporarily supervised at the start location of a mode profile, update of stored 
information in spec ific situations (see sections A.3.4 and 4.10)).  
3.13.8.2.3  A target corresponding to a speed decrease of the MRSP shall be removed from the 
list of supervised targets when the max safe front end of the train has passed the 
target location.  
3.13.8.3  Emergency Brake Deceleratio n curves (EBD)  
3.13.8.3.1  If a target belongs to the MRSP or is an LOA, the on -board shall calculate an EBD 
curve based on the safe deceleration A_safe(V,d) , that crosses the ceiling speed EBI 
supervision limit (see 3.13.9.2 ) at the target location , and that extends up to the 
location where the target speed is reached (EBD foot) .

the driver, to avoid excessive wear of the brakes and to save traction energy.  
3.13.8.5.2  If the National Value does not inhibit them, the on -board shall calculate a guidance 
curve (GUI) for each supervised target, based on the normal service brake 
decelerati on A_normal_service(V,d). The foot of a GUI curve (i.e. the location where 
the GUI speed is equal to the target speed) shall be:

  Release speed monitoring start location  
3.13.9.1.2  The purpose of the emergency brake intervention supervision limit is to assure that the 
train will remain within the various limits (in distance/speed) imposed by the trackside.  
3.13.9.1.3  The purpose of all other supervision limits is to assist the driver in preventing an 
emerg ency brake intervention by maintaining the speed of the train within the 
appropriate limits.  
3.13.9.2  Ceiling supervision limits  
3.13.9.2.1  The ceiling supervision limits are derived from the MRSP elements, where the speed is 
constant (refer to 3.13.7 ) or from the LOA.  
3.13.9.2.2  From an MRSP element or from the LOA, the Permitted speed, Warning, Service

V_delta0 = V_ura  (see Figure 45). 
3.13.9.3.2.2  The time elapsed between the Emergency brake intervention and the full a pplication 
of the braking effort is reached (EBD) shall be split into two parts:  
a) Time during which the traction effort is still present: T_traction  
b) Remaining time during which the traction effort is not present: T_berem  
3.13.9.3.2.3  The traction time (T_Traction) shall  be defined as follows:  
a) when the traction cut -off is implemented:  
T_traction = MAX((T_traction_cut_off - (T_warning + T_bs2)) ; 0).  
b) when the traction cut -off is not implemented: T_traction = T_traction_cut_off  
3.13.9.3.2.4  Note: When the traction cut -off is implemented , the traction cut -off command is 
triggered when passing the warning limit. The term (T_warning + T_bs2) in the 
equation above takes this into account, assuming that the warning limit is derived from 
the EBD.  
3.13.9.3.2.5  T_bs2 and T_warning are defined in sections 3.13.9.3.3  and 3.13.9.3.4 . 
3.13.9.3.2.6  The remaining time with no traction (T_berem) shall be equal to MAX(T_be - 
T_traction ; 0).  
3.13.9.3.2.7  Note: T_Traction exceeding T_be is rather a theoretical case, but is nevertheless 
included to make the specifications complete.  
3.13.9.3.2.8  During T_traction, the estimated acceleration (A_est1) shall be the one  measured at 
the moment when the calculation is made, but limited to positive or null values . 
3.13.9.3.2.9  If T_be > T_traction, the estimated accelerat ion during T_berem (A_est2) shall be 
the one measured at the moment when the calculation is made, but limited to values 
between 0 and +0.4m/s2. 
3.13.9.3.2.10  The compensated speed and the distance travelled during the time elapsed 
between the Emergency brake interventio n and the full application of the braking effort 
is reached shall be derived as follows (see Figure 45):

3.13.9.3.3.1  For the EOA, the on -board shall calculate the location of the SBI supervision limit

the interval T_bs1, until the SBD curve is rea ched.

3.13.9.3.3.4  If both the service brake command and the servi ce brake feedback are available for

by the driver  in target speed monitoring or release speed monitoring , they shall be 
reduced and possibly locked to the respective fixed  values of 0s and T_bs2_locked, 
until the ceiling speed monitoring is entered ; they are then reset to T_bs ( refer to

3.13.9.3.5.9  In order to determine the reference location of the target distance dis played to the 
driver , in order to check whether the target is masking another one,  and in order to 
determine the foot of the GUI curve (only if it is enabled) in case of target different from  
EOA/SvL, the location of the Permitted speed supervision limit, valid for the target 
speed, shall be calculated from the EBD, taking into account the following 
assumptions:  
a) the estimated acceleration shall be set to “zero”  
b) if not inhibited by National Value, the compensation of the inaccuracy of the speed 
measurement s hall be set to a value calculated from the target speed, as defined in 
SUBSET -041 § 5.3.1.2: V_ delta0 t = f 41(V_target)  
3.13.9.3.5.10  To do so, the same formulas defined above with V_est and V_ delta0  shall be

3.13.9.3.6.3  Note: The reduction of T_indication by a factor is intended to improve performance 
and the feasibility of this reduction is based on experience with real implementations. 
To avoid very low values when T_bs is small, a minimum is defined for T_indication, 
giving the driver always enough time to operate the brake.  
3.13.9.3.6.4  If the service brake feedback interface is available for use then T_indication shall be 
equal to  5s + T_driver . 
3.13.9.4  Release speed supervision limits  
3.13.9.4.1  The release speed is a special ceiling speed limit, applicable in the vicinity of the EOA. 
The EBI supervision limit is equal to the release speed. There is no SBI, W, P, I 
supervision limit associated to th e release speed.  
3.13.9.4.2  Note: The release speed may be necessary for two reasons. One is that a train has to 
be able to approach the EOA where the permitted speed reaches zero and might be 
too restrictive to permit acceptable driving due to inaccuracy of the meas ured distance. 
The other reason is that in a level 1 application the train has to be able to overpass the 
balise when the signal clears. For these two reasons a (low) release speed may be 
given from trackside or may be calculated on board, based on the dis tance from the 
EOA to the Supervised Location.  
3.13.9.4.3  With each MA, it shall be possible for the trackside to:  
a) Give the value of the release speed directly to the on -board, OR  
b) Instruct the on -board to calculate the release speed, OR  
c) Instruct the on -board to use t he national value.  
3.13.9.4.4  In case the MA does not identify the variant to be used or in case of LOA, no release 
speed shall be supervised.  
3.13.9.4.5  Note: When the release speed is given as a fixed value from trackside, the 
ERTMS/ETCS system cannot be responsible for stopp ing the train in rear of the 
Supervised Location. In this case, it is the full responsibility of the infrastructure 
manager to set the appropriate release speed with regard to the risk of passing the 
Supervised Location.  
3.13.9.4.6  The start location of the release s peed monitoring (i.e. where the EBI supervision limit 
related to EBD is replaced with an EBI supervision limit equal to the release speed 
value) shall be the location of the most restrictive SB I supervision limit  among the SBI1 
related to EOA, the SBI2 rel ated to SvL  and, when the Release Speed is calculated 
on-board, the SBI2 supervision limit(s) related to other target(s), if any, between the

3.13.9.4.8.2.1  Note: The above formulas  are intended to prevent the calculated release speed 
from fluctuating, according to the distance, speed and acceleration measurements. It 
allows calculating the release speed only once , for a given on-board  reference 
location, unless  
 the distance confidence interval exceeds a predicted one, which is based on 
the assumption that the whole distance between the current on -board 
reference location and the EOA would be travelled with SUBSET -041 
odometer performance values  and without any update of the on -board 
reference location, or  
 the speed under reading amount (V_ura) exceeds the SUBSET -041 
performance value  
Whenever the on-board reference location is updated (e.g. new LRBG), the release 
speed will however be recalculated and will increase with a step. This behaviour is 
acceptable from an operational point of view.

3.13.10.1  Introducti on 
3.13.10.1.1  By comparing the train speed and position  to the various supervision limits defined in 
the previous section, the on -board equipment generates braking commands, traction 
cut-off commands and relevant information  to the driver.  The information displayed t o 
the driver is selected according to the following supervision statuses of the speed and 
distance monitoring function: Normal status, Indication status, Overspeed status, 
Warning status and Intervention status.  
3.13.10.1.2  The following types of speed and distance mo nitoring are defined:  
 Ceiling speed monitoring  (CSM)  
 Target speed monitoring  (TSM)

Figure 53: Different types of speed and distance monitoring  
3.13.10.1.3  Ceiling speed monitoring is the speed supervision in the area where the train can run 
without the need to brake to a target.  
3.13.10.1.4  Target speed monitoring is the speed and distance supervision in the area where the 
specific information related to a target is displayed to the driver and wit hin which the 
train brakes to a target.  
3.13.10.1.5  Release speed monitoring is the speed and distance supervision in the area close to 
the EOA where the train is allowed to run with release speed to approach the EOA.  
3.13.10.2  General requirements  
3.13.10.2.1  The train speed indicated to the driver shall be identical to the speed used for the 
speed monitoring . This shall be the estimated speed . 
3.13.10.2.2  Once a Train Interface command (traction cut -off, service brake or emergency brake) 
is triggered, the on -board shall apply it until its correspondi ng revocation condition is 
met. 
3.13.10.2.3  If there is no on -board interface with the service brake or if the use of the service brake 
command is not allowed by a National Value (only in Target speed monitoring), 
whenever a service brake command is specified, the eme rgency brake command shall 
be triggered instead.  
3.13.10.2.4  The emergency brake command, which is triggered instead of the service brake 
command when an SBI supervision limit is exceeded, shall be revoked according to 
the requirements specified for the revocation of service brake command, unless the

 emergency brake command has been also triggered due to an EBI supervision limit. In 
such case, the condition for revoking the emergency brake command due to EBI 
supervision limit shall prevail.  
3.13.10.2.5  The on -board shall revoke th e Intervention status only when no brake command is 
applied by the speed and distance monitoring function.  
3.13.10.2.6  In level 2/3: Train trip shall be initiated if the on -board equipment detects that the 
minimum safe front end has passed the EOA/LOA location.  
3.13.10.2.7  In Lev el 1: Train Trip shall be initiated if the on -board equipment detects that the 
minimum safe antenna position (calculated by subtracting distance between active 
Eurobalise antenna and the front end of the train from the min safe front end position) 
has pass ed the EOA/LOA location.  
3.13.10.2.8  In the following sections , the term V_MRSP (together with the derived ceiling 
supervision limits) refers to the lowest MRSP element encountered between the min 
safe front end and the max safe front end of the train.  
3.13.10.3  Requirements fo r Ceiling speed monitoring  
3.13.10.3.1  The on -board equipment shall display the Permitted speed  ceiling supervision limit . 
3.13.10.3.2  When the supervision status is Overspeed, Warning or Intervention, the on -board 
equipment shall display the SBI speed  ceiling supervision limit . 
3.13.10.3.3  The on -board shall compare the estimated speed with the ceiling supervision limits 
defined in section 3.13.9.2  and shall trigger /revoke  commands to the train interface 
(service brake if implemented or emergency brake) and super vision statuses  as 
described in Table 5 and Table 6.

 the case, the on -board shall immediately set the supervision status to the relevant 
value, applying a transition from the Normal status according to Table 7. 
3.13.10.3.6  The Indication status is not used in ceiling speed moni toring. However, in case the 
ceiling speed monitoring is entered and the supervision status was previously set to 
Indication, the on -board equipment shall immediately execute one of the transitions 
from the Indication status, as described in Table 7. 
3.13.10.3.7  In ceiling speed  monitoring, only the ceiling supervision limits (described in section 
3.13.9.2 ) are used to determine the commands to the Train Interface and the 
supervision statuses displayed to the drive r. However the braking to targ et super vision 
limits and the release speed supervision limits (described  in section s 3.13.9.3  and 
3.13.9.4 ) are also used to determine the locations where the transiti on to target speed 
monitoring  and to release speed monitoring occur respectively . 
3.13.10.3.8  The on -board equipment shall display to the driver the first Indication location that will 
be reached by either the max safe or by the estimated train front end. To that effe ct,

 ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall not display any first Indication location 
information.  
3.13.10.3.9  If A_MAXREDADH (see 3.13.6.2.1.6) requests the target information as 
supplementary DMI information, the on -board equipment shall display to the driver the 
target information (target speed and distance to target) related to one target at a time: 
the Most Relevant Displayed Target (MRDT). The MRDT shall be selected amongst 
the supervised targets as the one whose remaining distance to its Indication 
supervision limit (as specified in 3.13.10.3.8 and 3.13.10.3.8.1) is the shortest. The 
indicated distance to the target shall be computed in the same way as for target speed 
monitoring, i.e. clauses 3.13.10.4.7, 3.13.10.4.8 and 3.13.10.4.8.1  shall apply.  
3.13.10.3.9.1  Exception: In case the list of supervised targets is empty or in case of LOA with no 
EBD based target whose speed value is below or equal to the estimated speed, the 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall not display any target information.  
3.13.10.3.10  If A _MAXREDADH (see 3.13.6.2.1.6) requests a time to Indication as 
supplementary DMI information, the on -board equipment shall compute the Time to 
Indication (TTI) as the time to travel at the estimated speed the remaining distance to 
the first Indication loca tion (as specified in 3.13.10.3.8 and 3.13.10.3.8.1). The on -
board equipment shall inform the driver as long as this time is shorter than a fixed 
value (refer to A.3.1).  
3.13.10.3.10.1  Exception: In case the list of supervised targets is empty or in case of LOA with no 
EBD based target whose speed value is below or equal to the estimated speed, the 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall not compute any time to Indication.  
3.13.10.4  Requirements for Target speed monitoring  
3.13.10.4.1  In target speed monitoring, both the ceiling supervision limits  and the braking to target 
supervision limits, described in sections 3.13.9.2  and 3.13.9.3 , are used to determine 
the commands to the Train Interface and the supervision statuses  displayed to the 
driver. 
3.13.10.4.2  The on -board equipment shall display to the driver the target information (target speed 
and distance to target) related to one target at a time: the Most Re levant  Displayed 
Target (MRDT). The MRDT shall be selected amongst the supervised targets whos e 
Indication supervision lim it is exceeded (i.e. a condition to trigger a supervision status 
with respect to these targets is met, se e table 8 and table 9) and shall be determined 
according to the following steps : 
 Step 0: MRDT 0 = the target of which the br aking to target Permitted speed 
supervision limit (refer to section 3.13.9.3.5 ), calculated for the current position of 
the train, is the lowest one amongst the concerned  targets:

 Step 1: the on -board equipment shall check whether the MRDT obtained from the 
previous step (MRDT 0) masks any other target(s) remaining in the list of concerned 
target s, whose target speed is lower than MRDT 0. A target is masked by MRDT 0 if 
its Indication supervision limit is located in rear of the location of the MRDT 0 
Permitted speed supervision limit, both at the target speed of MRDT 0. It shall be 
identified using on e of the following formulas, where both the Indication supervision 
limit and the Permitted speed supervision limit are calculated using the sa me 
formulas defined above and by substituting V_est with V_target_MRDT 0:

If at least one target is masked by MRDT 0, then the MRDT obtained from this step 
(MRDT 1) shall be the masked target with its Indication supervision limit the furthest  
in rear of the location of the MRDT 0 Permitted speed supervision limit and the on -
board equipment shall go to the next step.  
If none of the remaining targets from the list of concerned targets is masked by 
MRDT 0 or if there is no other remaining target to check in the list of con cerned 
targets, then the MRDT shall be the target obtained from the previous step (i.e. 
MRDT 0). 
... 
 Step n: the on -board shall apply step n -1, substituting MRDT n-2 with MRDT n-1 and 
checking the list of concerned targets excluding the targets which have bee n 
preselected as MRDT in all the previous steps (i.e. from MRDT 0 to MRDT n-1 
inclusive).  
3.13.10.4.2.1  Note 1: the above process for the determination of the MRDT ensures that in all 
circumstances (especially when several targets are close to each other) it is avoided 
that a target is displayed after its Indication supervision limit has been reached .

 3.13.10.4.2.2  Note 2: when entering target speed monitoring, there is by definition at least one 
target that satisfies the conditions to be selected as MRDT. Afterwards (e.g. due to 
train braking) it is possible that no target satisfies any more the conditions to be 
selected as MRDT, which however only means that the target previously selected 
remains the MRDT (see clause 3.13.10.4.5).  
3.13.10.4.2.3  Note 3: if MRDT n-1 is a target at zero speed (e.g. EOA or SvL) , then it is always 
selected as MRDT, i.e. no other target can be selected as MRDT as per step n .

 3.13.10.4.8.1  As long as the displayed values are locked due to SB feedback (see Appendix 
A.3.10 for details), the on -board equipment shall ensure that the displayed Permitted 
speed, the displayed SBI speed (if any) and the distance to target never increase (e.g. 
due to the reduction of T_bs1 and T_bs 2 or e.g. due to relocation). In other terms if a

above has a higher value than the previously displayed value, then the previous value 
shall remain displayed until a further cal culated value is lower than the displayed one.  
3.13.10.4.9  The on -board shall consider the service brake command as available for use unless:  
a) The service brake command is not implemented, OR  
b) The national value inhibits its use.  
3.13.10.4.10  The on -board equipment shall compare the  estimated speed and train position

 3.13.10.4.12  Note: Figure 55 shows the parts of the ceiling speed and braking to target 
supervision limits, which are used in target speed monitoring to trigger the brake 
commands and the transitions between supervision  statuses. It does not show what is 
displayed to the driver: in particular, the braking to target Permitted supervision limit is 
displayed (even if not supervised) for values lower than the release speed.  
3.13.10.4.13  In case of target EOA/SvL without any supervised re lease speed, the Table 9 
and Table 11 shall be applied, by substituting V_release with the value 0.  
3.13.10.4.13.1  In case the target is the location at the end of the maximum permitted distance to 
run in Staff Responsi ble, the Table 9 and Table 11 shall be applied, by substituting 
V_release with the value 0, SvL with staff responsible end location and by ignoring any 
formula related to EOA.  
3.13.10.4.14  A TI command shall be trigge red if a corresponding triggering condition is met for 
at least one target. On the other hand it shall be revoked only if a corresponding 
revocation condition is met for each supervised target.  
3.13.10.4.15  The on -board equipment shall execute the transitions between t he different 
supervision statuses as described in Table 12 (see section 4.6.1 for details about the

 3.13.10.4.16  When the speed and distance monitoring function becomes active and the target 
speed monitoring is the first one entered, the triggering conditio n t3 defined in Table 8 
or Table 9 shall be checked for each target in order to determine whether the 
Indication  status applies. If it is not the case, the on -board shall immediately set the 
supervision s tatus to the relevant value, applying a transition from the Indication  status 
according to clause 3.13.10.4.15 . 
3.13.10.4.17  The Normal status is not used in target  speed monitoring. However, in case the 
target  speed monitoring is entered and the supervision statu s was  previously set to 
Normal , the on -board equipment shall immediately execute one of the transition s from 
the Normal status , as specified in clause 3.13.10.4.15.  
3.13.10.4.18  Note: Depending upon train speed/position it is possible that for some target(s) 
none of the tri ggering conditions specified in table 8 and 9 is met. However the 
conditions to enter the target speed monitoring are such (see condition [1] in table 16) 
that the clauses 3.13.10.4.16 and 3.13.10.4.17 always allow determining a supervision 
status.  
3.13.10.5  Require ments for release speed monitoring  
3.13.10.5.1  The on -board equipment shall display the Release speed.  
3.13.10.5.2  The on -board equipment shall display the target distance in the same way as for target 
speed monitoring , i.e. clauses 3.13.10.4.8 and 3.13.10.4.8.1 shall apply . 
3.13.10.5.3  The braking to target Permitted speed supervision limit related to the MRDT (i.e. EOA

3.13.10.4.8.1 shall apply . 
3.13.10.5.4  The on -board equipment shall compare the estimated speed with the release speed

 3.13.10.6.5  On executing a transition between types of speed and distance mon itoring, the 
supervision status shall be determined according to the requirements specified for the 
newly entered speed and distance monitoring.  
3.13.11  Perturbation location  
3.13.11.1  The purpose of the perturbation location is to trigger the MA request to the RBC in 
order  to renew the Movement Authority in due time before the train would have to 
brake to an EOA/SvL or LOA target.  
3.13.11.2  For the SvL or the LOA, the on -board shall calculate the perturbation location as 
follows.  
3.13.11.3  Starting from the first element of the MRSP (i.e. from  the start location of the on -board 
stored track description), the on -board shall calculate the location of the Indication 
supervision limit, valid for the speed of the MRSP element, taking into account the 
following assumptions:  
a) the estimated acceleration  shall be set to “zero”  
b) if not inhibited by National Value, the compensation of the inaccuracy of the speed 
measurement shall be set to a value, calculated from the speed of the MRSP 
element, as defined in SUBSET -041 § 5.3.1.2: V_delta0ind = f 41(V_MRSP -n) 
c) If available for use, the service brake feedback shall not have any effect: T_bs1ind 
and T_bs2ind shall be set to T_bs if the service brake command is available for use, 
otherwise they shall be set to “zero”. T_tractionind and T_beremind shall be defined 
as in 3.13.9.3.2 for T_traction and T_berem by substituting T_bs2 with T_bs2ind  
3.13.11.4  To calculate the EBI supervision limit, the same formulas defined above with V_est, 
T_traction, T_berem and V_delta0 shall be applied, by substituting V_est with 
V_MRSP -n, T_tra ction with T_tractionind, T_berem with T_beremind and V_delta0 
with V_delta0ind.

3.13.11.9  If, in exceptional situation (e.g. after a shortening of MA), the EBD, SBD or GUI speed

MRSP, the location  to trigger the MA request t o the RBC  shall be considered as 
already passed . 
3.13.11.10  Note: For trackside engineering reasons, the assumptions for the calculation of the EBI 
supervision limit are necessary to obtain a fully predictable p erturb ation location, i.e. 
independent from the measured  acceleration and speed confidence interval.  
3.14 Brake Command Handling and Protection against Undesirable 
Train Movement  
3.14.1  Brake Command Handling  
3.14.1.1  Note: Whenever the type of brake used is not specified explicitly in the text, it shall be 
interpreted as not being  important for technical interoperability and being a property of  
the specific implementation.  
3.14.1.2  In case only the application of  (the non -vital) service brake has been commanded and 
the service brake fails to be applied, the emergency brake command shall be given.  
3.14.1.3  If the emergency brake command was triggered due to a trip condition (see chapter 4) 
the emergency brake command shall be released at standstill and after driver 
acknowledgement of the trip condition.  
3.14.1.4  For handling of brake commands resulting from  the speed and distance monitoring, 
refer to section 3.13.10 . 
3.14.1.5  If the brake command was triggered due to roll away protection, reverse movement 
protection or standstill supervision the brake command shall be released at standstill 
and after driver acknowled gement.  
3.14.1.6  If the brake command was triggered due to linking error, balise group message 
inconsistency or RAMS related supervision error, the brake command shall be 
released at standstill.  
3.14.1.7  If the brake command was triggered due to supervision of the safe rad io connection 
(T_NVCONTACT) the brake command shall be released at standstill or if a new 
consistent message has been received from the RBC.  
3.14.1.7.1  If the brake command was triggered due to an overpassed  reversing distance related 
to a reversing area  or due to a ny further movement in the direction opposite to the train

 orientation while the reversing distance is still overpassed , the brake command shall 
be released if the reversing distance becomes  extended so that the reversing distance 
is no longer overpassed , or at standstill after driver acknowledgement.  
3.14.1.7.2  If the brake command was triggered due to change of Train Data while running (see 
section 5.17 procedure "Changing Train Data from sources different from the driver”), 
the brake command shall be released at st andstill and after driver acknowledge ment . 
3.14.1.7.3  If the brake command was triggered due to the detection of a train movement while 
modifying/revalidating train data or while entering SR speed/distance limits, the brake 
command shall be released at standstill and  after driver acknowledgement. . 
3.14.1.7.4  If the brake command was triggered due to an overpass ed distance allowed for moving 
backwards in Post Trip mode  or due to any further movement in the direction opposite 
to the train orientation while the distance allowed for  moving backwards in Post Trip 
mode is still overpassed , the brake command shall be released at standstill and after 
driver acknowledgement.  
3.14.1.7.5  If the brake command was triggered due to the driver not having acknowledged a text 
message, the brake command shal l be released after the driver has acknowledged the 
text message.  
3.14.1.8  An indication shall be given to the driver to indicate when the brakes can be released 
and when an acknowledgement is requested.  
3.14.2  Roll Away Protection  
3.14.2.1  Note: This protection is only applicable  if the required information can be obtained from 
the direction controller.  
3.14.2.2  The Roll Away Protection (RAP) shall prevent the train from moving in a direction, 
which conflicts with the current position of the direction controller in the active desk.  
3.14.2.3  If the controller is in neutral position, the RAP shall prevent forward and reverse 
movements of the train.  
3.14.2.4  When the system recognises a movement exceeding the national value for the allowed 
roll away distance the brakes shall be triggered.  
3.14.2.5  Refer to section 3.14.1 . 
3.14.2.6  An indication shall be given to the driver showing when the RAP is commanding the 
brakes.  
3.14.2.7  After revocation of the brake command the RAP shall be re -initialised using the current 
position of the train as the new reference loc ation.

 3.14.3  Reverse Movement Protection  
3.14.3.1  The Reverse Movement Protection (RMP) shall prevent the train from moving in the 
opposite direction to the permitted one. The permitted movement direction of a train 
shall be the one of the currently valid MA, if availabl e on -board. See chapter 4 
concerning permitted direction for special cases.  
3.14.3.2  When a reverse movement is detected, the brake command shall be triggered after a 
distance s pecified by the national value.  
3.14.3.3  Refer to section 3.14.1 . 
3.14.3.4  An indication shall be given to the driver showing when the RMP is commanding the 
brakes.  
3.14.3.5  After revocation of the brake command the RMP shall be reinitialised using the current 
position of the train as the new reference location.  
3.14.3.6  Information received from ba lises during reverse movement shall be ignored . 
3.14.4  Standstill supervision  
3.14.4.1  This function shall prevent the train from moving.  
3.14.4.2  When a movement is detected, the brake command shall be triggered after a distance 
specified by the national value.  
3.14.4.3  Refer to section 3.14.1 . 
3.14.4.4  After revocation of the brake command the standstill supervision shall be re -initialised.  
3.14.4.5  If a cab is active, an indication shall be given to the driver showing when the Standstill 
Supervision is commanding the brakes.

3.15.1  RBC/RBC Handover  
3.15.1.1  Introduction  
3.15.1.1.1  The RBC/RBC Handover principles are such that trains are able to pass from one RBC 
area to another automatically (without driver action).  
3.15.1.1.2  This is also granted when, due to a failure in the on -board radio commu nication 
system,  the on -board is no longer able to manage two communication sessions at 
once. Thereby, the behaviour of the RBCs is independent from such on -board 
degraded situation .

 3.15.1.1.3  However, a n RBC/RBC handover performed by a train with only one communica tion 
session available may result in performance penalties since it will not be able to 
“prepare” (session establishment, version determination, …) the expected supervision 
by the Accepting RBC until the on -board disconnects from the Handing Over RBC.  
3.15.1.1.4  In level 3, trains following the one with only one communication  session available will 
always suffer performance penalties since no more position reports will be issued from 
the disconnection from the Handing Over RBC until the connection to the Accepting 
RBC . 
3.15.1.2  Handing Over RBC  
3.15.1.2.1  When the Handing Over RBC detects that a route is set for a train to enter another 
RBC area, it shall send:  
a) Intentionally deleted.  
b) To the Accepting RBC the following information:  
 The ETCS identity of the on -board equipment;  
 The border lo cation that will be passed by the train when entering the Accepting 
RBC area;  
 Current mode of the on -board equipment;  
 For a leading engine , Train Data  and Train Running Number ; 
 The system versions supported by the on -board equipme nt; 
 Optionally, for a non -leading engine, the ETCS identity of the leading engine.  
3.15.1.2.2  The Handing Over RBC shall not send information to an on -board equipment 
concerning the route in advance of the border without receiving the corresponding 
information from the Accepting RBC.  
3.15.1.2.3  It shall  be possible for the Handing Over RBC to request route related information from 
the Accepting RBC, limited to a maximum amount of data.  
3.15.1.2.3.1  Route related information is :  
a) Movement authorities  
b) Linking  
c) International static speed profiles  
d) Axle Load Speed profiles  
e) Gradients  
f) Temporary speed restrictions  
g) Mode profiles

3.15.1.2.3.2  Note: The amount of information to be sent between the RBCs is depending on the 
implementation trackside.  
3.15.1.2.4  Note: Route related information received from the Accepting RBC will be processed by 
the Handing Over RBC if possible.  
3.15.1.2.5  Deleted.  
3.15.1.2.6  When the Handing Over RBC r eceives a position report and detects that the maximum 
safe front end of the train has passed the border location, it shall inform the Accepting 
RBC.  
3.15.1.2.6.1  Note: This information might be needed to inform the signalman of the Accepting 
RBC that the train has ent ered the Accepting RBC area.  
3.15.1.2.7  When the Handing Over RBC receives a position report and detects that the minimum 
safe rear end of the train has crossed the border, it shall send a disconnection order to 
the on -board equipment.  
3.15.1.2.8  When the Accepting RBC informs the Handing Over RBC that it has taken over the 
responsibility, the latter shall stop sending route related information to the on -board 
equipment.  
3.15.1.2.9  When the Handing Over RBC detects that the transition to the Accepting RBC has to 
be cancelled, it shall sen d this cancellation information to the Accepting RBC (including 
the train identification).  
3.15.1.2.9.1  Note: For instance, the cancellation procedure can be triggered by:  
 Change to a route which does no more include the border;  
 The sending of an “end of mission” info rmation from the on -board equipment.  
3.15.1.3  On-board equipment  
3.15.1.3.1  When receiving an order to switch to another RBC at a given location, the on -board 
equipment shall:  
a) Establish the communication session with the Accepting RBC;

 b) Send a position report to the Handing Ov er RBC when the maximum safe front end 
of the train passes the given location;  
c) Send a position report to the Handing Over RBC when the minimum safe rear end 
of the train passes the given location;  
3.15.1.3.2  Exception to 3.15.1.3.1 a) (degraded situation):  If the on -board equipment  is able to 
handle only one communication session at a given time, it shall wait until the session 
with the Handing over RBC is terminated due to crossing the border and then establish 
the session with the Accepting RBC.  
3.15.1.3.3  As soon as the on -board equipment has established the session with the Accepting 
RBC, it shall send its Train Data unless it is in sleeping or non leading mode.  
3.15.1.3.4  When the on -board equipment is connected to both RBCs, it shall send its position 
reports to both of them with the use of the position report parameters valid for the 
Handing Over RBC.  
3.15.1.3.4.1  If the on -board equipment is connected to both RBCs, and it executes an End of 
Mission, it shall execute the End of Mission procedure with both RBCs  
3.15.1.3.5  As soon as  the on -board sends a posit ion report directly to the Accepting RBC with its 
maximum safe front end having passed the border, it shall use information received 
from the Accepting RBC and only a disconnection order shall be accepted from the 
Handing Over RBC.  
3.15.1.3.5.1  Intentionally deleted . 
3.15.1.3.6  While both  communication sessions are opened, if information is received from the 
Accepting RBC before a position report is sent to the Accepting RBC with the 
maximum safe front end having passed the border, this information shall be stored on -
board.  
Excep tion: The acknowledgement of Train Data shall be immediately accepted by the 
on-board equipment.  
3.15.1.3.6.1  Note: for the exhaustive list of accepted/rejected information, please refer to 
Chapter 4 Use of received information.  
3.15.1.3.7  When the train front end passes the ann ounced border or when an order to execute 
the RBC transition immediately is received, the on -board shall substitute the current 
valid RBC ID/phone number with those of the Accepting RBC . 
3.15.1.3.8  After this substitution, the on -board shall however retain the RBC ID /phone number of 
the Handing Over RBC until at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled:  
a) Min safe rear end of the train has passed the border and the communication 
session with this Handing Over RBC has been terminated , 
b) The RBC transition order i s deleted according to A.3.4 or 4.10 .

 3.15.1.3.8.1  Note: Even after the train front end has passed the border, the on -board may have 
to maintain the communication session with the Handing Over RBC (see 3.5.4) or re -
establish it (see 3.5.3.4 f) ) and needs therefore to r emember the RBC ID/phone 
number of this RBC.  
3.15.1.3.9  In case the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment has reported that the train has passed 
with its min safe rear end the announced border and no order to terminate the session 
is received from the Handing Over RBC within  a fixed waiting time (see Appendix 
A.3.1) from the time the position report was sent, it shall repeatedly send a position 
report with the fixed waiting time after each repetition, until the order to terminate the 
session is received, or the defined number  of repetitions (see Appendix A.3.1) has 
been reached. If no reply is received within the fixed waiting time after the last 
repetition, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall terminate the communication 
session with the Handing Over RBC.  
3.15.1.4  Accepting RBC  
3.15.1.4.1  The Accepting RBC shall keep route related information sent to the Handing Over RBC 
updated. In particular, this possibly includes temporary speed restrictions.  
3.15.1.4.2  As soon as the Accepting RBC receives from the on -board equipment a position report 
and detects th at the maximum safe front end of the train has passed the border, it shall  
inform the Handing Over RBC that it has taken over the responsibility.  
3.15.1.4.3  When the Accepting RBC receives Train Data from both the on -board equipment and 
the Handing over RBC Train Dat a provided by the on -board equipment shall take 
precedence.  
3.15.1.4.4  If the Accepting RBC receives a cancellation information from the Handing Over RBC, 
it shall send an order to terminate the communication session to the corresponding on -
board equipment (if alread y established).  
3.15.1.4.5  The Accepting RBC shall comply with the maximum amount of data contained in the 
last received route related information request from the Handing Over RBC.  
3.15.1.5  RBC/RBC message acknowledgement  
3.15.1.5.1  As soon as a consistent RBC/RBC message including the  request for 
acknowledgement is received, the receiving RBC shall send an acknowledgement to 
the emitting RBC.  
3.15.1.5.2  The RBC/RBC message is consistent  when all checks have been completed 
successfully:  
a) It has passed the checks performed by the RBC/RBC Safe Commun ication 
Interface protocol (see SUBSET -098);  
b) Variables in the message do not have invalid values.

 3.15.1.5.3  The acknowledgement message shall refer to the identity of the concerned message 
sent by the emitting RBC.  
3.15.2  Handling of Trains with Non Leading Engines  
3.15.2.1  It is possible to operate a train using more than one engine, each engine being under 
the control of a driver.  
3.15.2.2  Only the leading engine is responsible for the train movement supervision functions.  
3.15.3  Splitting/joining  
3.15.3.1  ERTMS/ETCS allow s Splitting and Joining using the  normal supervision functions 
available (e.g. On -sight, Shunting).  
3.15.3.2  Splitting only refers to the case that the two resulting trains contain at least one 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment each.  
3.15.3.2.1  Note: This must be ensured by operational procedures.  
3.15.3.3  ERTMS/ETCS is not responsible for providing information that a Splitting/Joining 
operation has been correctly completed (technical aspect and/or operational aspect).  
3.15.3.4  Justification: ERTMS/ETCS is not able to provide this information. Splitting and Joining 
require s the fu lfilment of operating rules ensuring that a Splitting/Joining operation has 
been correctly completed (e.g. physical disconnection).  
3.15.4  Reversing of movement direction  
3.15.4.1  It shall be possible to send in advance to an on -board equipment information about 
areas, wh ere initiation of reversing of movement direction is possible, i.e. change the 
direction of train movement without changing the train orientation.  
3.15.4.1.1  A new reversing area given from the trackside shall replace the one already available 
on-board.  
3.15.4.2  Together with  start and end of reversing area, the following supervision information 
shall be sent:  
a) Maximum distance to run in the direction opposite to the orientation of the reversing 
area, the fixed reference location being the end location of the area where reversi ng 
of movement is permitted  with which the maximum distance information is  sent. 
b) Reversing mode  speed limit allowed during reverse movement.

 3.15.4.4  While at standstill with the front end of the train inside the indicated area, it shall be 
possible for the driver to reverse the direction of movement.  
3.15.4.5  The on -board equipment shall allow movement in the direction opposite to the train 
orientation, supervising it according to distance and speed received.  
3.15.4.6  Note: level transitions and RBC /RBC handovers  are not handled by the ERTMS/ETCS 
on-board equipment  when in Reversing mode . 
3.15.4.7  When at standstill the on -board equipment shall inform the driver if the reversing of 
movement is permitted.  
3.15.4.8  If the end location of the maximum distance to run in the opposite direction is passed 
by the train front end, the emergency brake command shall be triggered.  
3.15.5  Track ahead free  
3.15.5.1  In a level 2/3 area, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment is able to handle a track 
ahead free request given by the RBC.  
3.15.5.2  The track ahead free request from the RBC shall ind icate to the on -board  
a) at which location the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall begin to display the 
request to the driver.  
b) at which location the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall stop to display the 
request to the driver (in case the driver did not ackn owledge).  
3.15.5.3  As long as it is displayed, the driver ha s the possibility to acknowledge the track ahead 
free request (meaning the driver confirms that the track between the head of the train 
and the next signal or board marking signal position is free).  
3.15.5.4  When t he driver acknowledges, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall stop 
displaying the request, and shall inform the RBC that the track ahead is free.  
3.15.5.5  There is no restrictive consequence by the on -board system if the driver does not 
acknowledge.  
3.15.5.6  A new track a head free request shall replace the one previously received and stored.

3.15.6.5  Amongst the data to be used by applications outside ERTMS/ETCS that can be 
transmitted b y trackside over the ERTMS/ETCS transmission channels,  it shall be 
possible  to send from balises or RBC data to be forwarded to a  National System . 
3.15.6.5.1  Note: Definition of what qualifies as  “data to be forwarded  to a National System ” is 
national dependent and o utside the scope of Subset 026.  
3.15.7  Tolerance of Big Metal Mass  
3.15.7.1  Big metal object in the track, exceeding the limits for big metal masses as defined in 
Subset -036, section 6.5.2 “Metal Masses in the Track” may trigger an alarm reporting 
a malfunction for the on board balise transmission function.  
3.15.7.2  In Levels 0/ NTC, the alarms which may be triggered by metal masses shall be ignored 
for a defined distance (see A .3.1). If the alarm persists for a longer distance the 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall trigger a safety  reaction.  
3.15.7.3  Justification: Ignoring the alarm for a defined distance eliminates the need to equip all 
excessive big metal masses with track condition “Big Metal Mass” outside ETCS fitted 
areas.  
3.15.8  Cold Movement Detection  
3.15.8.1  After being switched off (i.e. once in No Power mode), the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 
equipment shall be capable, if fitted with, to detect and record whether the engine has 
been moved or not, during a period of at least 72 hours.  
3.15.8.2  When powered on again, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall use, if 
available, the memorised information about cold movement in order to update the 
status of information stored by on -board equipment (see chapter 4 section 4.11 for 
details).  
3.15.8.3  Note: information memorised by Cold Movement Detection function is considered as 
not available if:  
a) no Cold Movement Detection function is implemented in the ERTMS/ETCS on -
board equipment, OR  
b) the Cold Movement Detection function has encountered a condition, during the No 
Power period, which prevents the use of the Cold Movement informatio n (e.g. the 
battery ensuring the Cold Movement Detection function has run down during the No 
Power period).

 3.15.9  Virtual Balise Cover  
3.15.9.1  It shall be possible to se t and remove from balise a Virtual Balise Cover  (VBC) . A VBC 
is defined by : 
a) A marker corresponding to  balises to be ignored by the on -board  together  with the 
area (country or region) in which the VBC  is applicable . The VBC marker and the 
country/region identity form the unique VBC identity . 
b) Its validity period . 
3.15.9.2  During a start of mission, the driver shall have the opportunity to set a new VBC , or to 
remove an existing one. 
3.15.9.3  As long as a VBC is stored on -board:  
a) The ERTMS/ETC S on-board equipment shall ignore  any balise telegram that 
include s a VBC marker  and a country/region identity that both match the VBC 
identity.  
b) No reaction shall be applied if errors in the reading of the rest of such balise 
telegram occur.  
3.15.9.4  If the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment receives from balise or from driver a new 
VBC with the same VBC identity as an already stored VBC, the new VBC sha ll replace 
the previous one, including its validity period . 
3.15.9.5  A VBC shall be retained on-board when the on -board equipment is switched off (i.e. 
enters No Power mode)  and shall remai n applicable  when powered on  again . It shall 
be deleted when:  
a) it is ordered  by trackside , or 
b) its validity period has elapsed , or 
c) it is removed by the d river (during Start of Mission), or  
d) a mismatch is detected between the country/region identity read from  a balise group 
and the country/region identity of the VBC. Not e: this means that the reception of a 
consistent balise group message is a necessary condition for deleting  a VBC due to 
mismatching country/region  identities. 
3.15.10  Advance display of route related information  
3.15.10.1  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall display an overview of th e gradient 
profile (as received from trackside), of the MRSP, of the track conditions  (except the 
tunnel stopping areas) , of the first I ndication location , if any (only in Ceiling Speed 
monitoring ), and of the EOA/LOA , with the remaining distances referred  to the train 
front end position.

3.16.1  Criteria of consistency  
3.16.1.1  The on-board shall not consider a message transmitted from the trackside if any of the 
following criteria is not fulfilled.  
a) Correctness of the received message: the whole message shall be complete and 
respect the ETCS language; variables shall not have invalid  values  
b) The message shall be received in due time.

information in the following cases:  
a) If the location reference of the expected balise group is found in rear of the 
expectation window  
b) If the location reference of the expected balise group is not found inside the 
expectation window (i.e . the end of  the expectation window has been reached 
without having found the expected balise group ) 
c) If inside the expectation window of the expected balise group another announced 
balise group, expected later, is found.  
3.16.2.3.1.1  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment s hall reject  the message from  a balise 
group found with its location reference outside its expectation window.  
3.16.2.3.2  The on -board shall reject the message from the expected group and trip the train if the 
balise group is passed in the unexpected direction.  
3.16.2.3.2.1  Except ion: When the expected balise group is referred in the linking information 
with a balise group with ID “unknown”, 3.4.4.4.2.1 shall apply.  
3.16.2.3.3  If the location reference balise of the group is duplicated and the on -board is only able 
to correctly evaluate the d uplicating one, the duplicating one shall be used as location 
reference instead.  
3.16.2.3.4  If the balise duplicating the location reference balise is used as location reference for 
the group, and is found within the expectation window, no linking reaction shall be 
applied.  
3.16.2.4  Balise Group Message Consistency  
3.16.2.4.1  If linking information is used, the on -board shall reject the message from a linked 
balise group found in the expected location and react according to the linking reaction 
in the following cases:  
a) A balise is missed inside the group.  
b) A balise is detected but no telegram is decoded (e.g. wrong CRC,...).  
c) Variables in the balise group message have invalid values.  
d) Message counters do not match (see 3.16.2.4.7)

excluding the ones complying with 3.16.2.4.6  and the ones that are not used by the on -
board to compose the message (see 3.16.2.4.8.2) , if their values are not al l identical, 
or at le ast one of  them complies with 3.16.2.4.6.1, this shall be considered as a 
message consistency error.  
3.16.2.4.7.1  In case of single balise group, if the message counter of the received telegram 
complies with 3.16.2.4.6.1, this shall also be considered as a message cons istency 
error.  
3.16.2.4.8  It shall be possible to indicate failures in the system underlying the balise/loop/RIU 
(e.g. the Lineside Electronic Unit, LEU) by sending a balise telegram, a loop message

3.16.2.4.8.1  If one (and only one) out of a pair of duplicated balise telegrams received by the on -
board includes the information “default balise information”, the on -board shall ignore 
any other information included in this telegram and shall consider in formation from the 
telegram not containing “default balise information".  
3.16.2.4.8.2  When duplicated balises are both found and decoded correctly, and both, or none 
of them, contain "default balise information", the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment 
shall compose the mess age using the telegram from the last received balise out of the 
pair.

 3.16.2.7.2.1  If repositioning is an nounced and the expected repositioning balise group has been 
found, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall keep looking for a balise group 
that satisfies the same criteria as this previously expected and already found 
repositioning balise group, until one  of the following events occurs:  
a) the on -board antenna leaves the expectation window of the repositioning balise 
group that was announced and already found  
b) a linked balise group that has been announced with known identity is found.  
3.16.2.7.2.2  If a second balise group is found that satisfies the same criteria as the previously 
expected and already found repositioning balise group, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 
equipment shall command the service brake  and the driver shall be informed . At 
standstill, the location based informa tion stored on -board  shall be shortened to the

3.17.1.1  Definitions, high level principles and rules regarding the offli ne management of 
ERTMS/ETCS system version during the ERTMS/ETCS system life time are given in 
SUBSET -104. 
3.17.1.2  The objective of th is section  is to define requirements applicable to ERTMS/ETCS on -
board equipment and to trackside constituents, when different ver sions  of the 
ERTMS/ETCS system have been defined . 
3.17.1.3  Intentionally deleted . 
3.17.2  Determination of the operated system version  
3.17.2.1  The on -board equipment shall be able to operate with (i.e. shall support) any of the 
ERTMS/ETCS system version  number s X included in the e nvelope of legally operated 
system versions, as defined in chapter 6.  
3.17.2.1.1  Within one of its supported system version numbers X, the on -board equipment shall 
always operate the highest system version number Y defined in this release of the 
SRS, regardless of th e system version number Y transmitted by the trackside . 
3.17.2.2  The on -board equipment shall operate with only one system version at a time, i.e. it 
shall behave according to the whole set of requirements applicable to a system version 
(refer to chapter 6 in case the operated system version is older than the last one 
introduced in this release of the SRS).  
3.17.2.3  The on -board equipment shall determine the operated system version  number X , in 
relation to non -RBC trackside constituents, as the system version number X 
transm itted by any balise, loop or RIU, if this system version number X is higher than 
the currently operated one.  
3.17.2.4  It shall be possible from balise group to order the on -board equipment to operate a 
system version.  
3.17.2.5  On receiving the order to operate system versio n from balise group, the on -board 
equipment shall immediately operate the system version number X  given in the order. 
After the order is executed, the requirement 3.17.2.3 shall be again applied for any 
further received balise telegram/loop message or any further contacted RIU.

 3.17.2.5.1  Note: the system version order is to be used wherever it is necessary to enforce an 
operated system version number X lower than the currently operated one.  
3.17.2.6  If a mismatch has been detected between the country or region identifier read  from a 
balise/loop and the corresponding identifier(s) for which a set of national values is used 
onboard, the on -board equipment shall consider the system version number X 
transmitted by this balise/loop as the operated one and shall comply again with 
requirement 3.17.2.3.  
3.17.2.7  If the on -board equipment does not support the system version number X transmitted 
by a non -RBC trackside constituent or the one specified in the balise group order, it 
shall consider the operated system version as unchanged.  
3.17.2.8  In case of  communication session established with an RBC, the system version 
number X  of the RBC shall take precedence on the operated system version in relation 
to non -RBC constituents and on system version ordered from balise group; the 
operated system version number X  shall be determined according to the following 
principles:  
a) if the on -board equipment is in level 0, NTC or 1 (e.g. entrance in level 2/3 area), 
the RBC system version number X  shall be operated when the transition to level 2/3 
is executed;  
b) if the on -board equipment is in level 2/3 (SoM procedure or order received from 
trackside), the RBC system version number X  shall be operated immediately;  
c) in case of session established with an accepting RBC (RBC/RBC Handover), the 
accepting RBC system version numbe r X shall be operated as soon as the engine 
has passed the RBC/RBC border location with its maximum safe front end;  
d) in case the on -board equipment switches from level 2/3 to another level (e.g. exit 
from a level 2/3 area), the system version control in rel ation to non -RBC 
constituents shall be again applied and the balise group orders shall be again 
considered;  
e) in case the engine passes the RBC/RBC border location with its maximum safe 
front end and no session is established with the accepting RBC, the syst em version 
control in relation to non -RBC constituents shall be again applied and the balise 
group orders shall be again considered.  
3.17.2.9  The system version currently operated when the on -board equipment is switched off 
(i.e. enters  No Power mode) shall be retained and re -used when powered on.  
3.17.2.9.1  If the on -board equipment loses the information (failure situation), the highest 
supported system version shall be used.  
3.17.3  Handling of trackside data in relation to system version  
3.17.3.1  Every telegram transmitted by a balise, and every message transmitted by Euroloop 
and Radio Infill Unit shall contain only the data related to one system version. It is not

be ignored.  
b) In all levels, if th is system version number X is different from 0 and lower than the

able to interpret the balise information, to the extent defined for each type of 
information (see chapter 6 fo r detailed requirements). If the on -board is not able to 
interpret the information, this shall be considered as a message consistency error.  
c) In all levels, if this system version number X is amongst its supported ones, the on -
board equipment shall be able to interpret the balise information. See chapter 6 for 
detailed requirements.  
d) In levels 1, 2 and 3, if this system version number X is greater than the highest

3.18.1.1  Note: Appendix to chapter 3 contains a list of Fixed values used as system parameters 
in the supervision. These parameters are system related and can easily be changed in 
later versions of the ERTMS/ETCS if required. These parameters are not defined as 
National data.

 3.18.2.2  Trains shall be supervised according to the National Values of the current 
infrastructure if they are available on -board.  
3.18.2.3  National Values are transmitted with the area(s) (country or region) in which they are 
applicable. They shall be come  applicable at a defined location, or shall be applicable 
immediately.  
3.18.2.4  Evaluating a balise group message, the balise identity information referring to the 
count ry or region shall be used to ensure that correct National Values are used.  
3.18.2.5  For each National Value, the corresponding Default Value shall be used as fall back 
value if:  
 the National Value  is not available, or  
 a mismatch has been detected between the cou ntry or region identifier read from a 
balise group and the corresponding identifier(s) of the applicable  set with which the  
National Value was received and stored . 
3.18.2.6  Note: even though the National Values are always transmitted as a single  set for a 
given sys tem version, the content of a set depends on the system version, so that 
when a set of National Values is received or becomes applicable, or when passing a 
balise group, the on -board equipment may apply clause 3.18.2.5 for a subset of 
National Values  
3.18.2.7  The N ational Values currently applicable when the on -board equipment is switched off 
(i.e. enters No Power mode) shall be retained and shall remain  applicable  when 
powered on.  
3.18.2.7.1  Justification:  The aim of this requirement is to limit the number of balise groups 
containing National Value information. Once a set of National Values has been 
received on -board, there is no need to re -load the information unless National Values 
change, the on -board equipment loses the information (failure situation), or the train 
enters  an area requiring different National Values.  
3.18.2.8  The applicable set of National Values data shall be transmitted from the trackside on 
transition between areas requiring a different set of National Values.  
3.18.2.8.1  When a new set of National Values becomes applicable its content  shall always 
overwrite the corresponding National Values  currently applicable regardless of the 
country or region identifier(s).  
3.18.2.9  A previously received set of National Values which is not yet applicable shall be 
deleted if:  
 a new set of National  Values is received, or  
 the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment is switched off (i.e., enters No Power 
mode).  
3.18.2.10  If a National Value becomes invalid, i.e., a mismatch has been detected between the 
country or region identifier read from a balise group and the corres ponding identifier(s)

A.3.3 Handling of information received from trackside  
A.3.3.1  Before it can be accepted and  used by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment, raw 
information received from trackside is subject to various checks, which can lead to the 
individual rejection/ignoring of information (e.g. Movement Authority not valid for the 
train orientation), the ignoring  of a whole balise telegram or the rejection of a whole 
message. The SRS clauses/sections corresponding to these checks are gathered in 
Table 17.

Table 17: Check of raw data received from trackside  
A.3.3.2  With the exception of the clauses/sections referred to in Table 17 and of the clause 
3.16.3.5.1, all the clauses in this specification in which trackside information is referred 
to (through the terms “balise”, “telegram”, “balise group [message]”, “message”, 
“[name of] information”...), shall be applied assuming that the information has not been 
ignored/rejected by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment due to all the checks listed 
in Table 17. 
A.3.3.3  Example 1: clause 3.16.2.4.9 has to be understood as follows: “If a <consistent>  
message <composed with telegrams that have passed the system version check, that 
have not been ignored because of a VBC, that have not been ignored because of 
duplication, and that have been received while no reverse movement was performed> 
has been received  <with one of its telegrams composing it>  containing the information 
“default balise information” <which is valid for the train orientation (or the balise group 
crossing direction for NL or SL engines) and which has passed the level and mode 
filters> , the driver shall be informed.”  
A.3.3.4  Example 2: as a result of the clause A.3.3.2, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment 
will not apply requirements in relation to the content of the telegram or the message 
such as:

  clause 3.6.2.2.2 a), in case the balise group message is rejected because not 
consistent (e.g. according to 3.16.2.4.1), it does not become LRBG  
 clause 3.16.3.3.3.1, in case the radio message is rejected because of its time 
stamp, this latter will not be used by the on -board to check the supervision o f 
sequence of further messages  
 clause 3.17.2.3, in case the balise telegram is ignored because of its system 
version number (e.g. according to 3.17.3.5 d)), this latter will not affect the system 
version operated by the on -board  
 clause 3.18.2.5 2nd bullet,  in case a message from a balise group marked as linked 
is rejected because the balise group was not announced by linking (see 
3.16.2.4.3), the balise group country or region identifier will not be compared with 
the one(s) of the currently applicable set o f National Values  
A.3.4 Handling of Accepted and Stored Information in specific 
Situations  
A.3.4.1  Introduction  
A.3.4.1.1  All data that can be stored onboard after being accepted may be influenced in special 
situations.  
A.3.4.1.2  The situations acting on t he “status” of stored information are:  
a) the execution of a conditional emergency stop (3.10.2.2);  
b) the reception of a shortened MA ( 3.8.5.1.3, 3.8.5.1.4 ); 
c) the stored MA is shortened due to a section time -out (3.8.4.2.2);  
d) the SvL is shifted (to the DP if any or to the EOA) due to an overlap time -out 
(3.8.4.4.2) ;  
e) the stored MA is shortened due to an end section time -out (3.8.4.1.2);  
f) a cooperative MA revocation is granted by the onboard (3.8.6.2);  
g) inconsistency in a balise group marked as unlinked and the train  is at standstill 
(3.16.2.5.2);  
h) a linking reaction led to a service brake and the train is at standstill (3.16.2.6.2) ;  
i) the reaction due to the supervision of the safe radio connection led to a service 
brake and the train is at standstill (3.16.3.4.5 b) ;  
j) the train category, axle load  category , loading gauge or traction system  is changed 
and the train is at standstill (3.18.3.7) ;  
k) driver closes the desk during SoM ;  
l) RAMS related supervision functions led to a service brake and the train is at 
standstill (3. 16.2.7)

n) the Limit of Authority becomes an End of Authority and the on -board considers an 
SvL (3.8.4.3.2)  
A.3.4.1.3  Depending on th e situation, the action shall be one of the following : 
a) data is deleted,

 A.3.5 Handling of Actions in Specific Situations  
A.3.5.1  Regards actions executed in reference to location information received from trackside, 
the on -board equipment shall ensure that the action related to a location is neither 
reverted, nor executed twice. Situations to be considered shall include reverse 
movement (initiated by driver or due to roll -away) and the sub -sequent forward 
movement, or adjustment of train position on passing a new LRBG . This rule shall 
apply  to the following actions:  
 Change of National Values (see 3.18.2)  
 Request to acknowledge new level, level transition (see SRS chapter 5.10)  
 Start and stop displaying plain or fixed text messages (see 3.12.3)  
 Request to acknowledge a mode profile, mode tran sition due to mode profile (see 
3.12.4)  
 Start and stop accepting radio infill information (see 3.9.3)  
 Actions related to RBC/RBC handover (see 3.15.1)  
 Actions related to track condition information (see 3.12.1) with the exception of big 
metal masses  and no n stopping areas  
 Permission to initiate Reversing mode, i.e., limits of Reversing Area (see 3.15.4)  
 Start and stop Track Ahead free  request to driver (see 3.15.5)  
 Start and stop calculation of geographical position (see 3.6.6)  
 Substitute the supervision of  the LX start location as the EOA/SvL by the inclusion 
of the LX speed restriction in the MRSP (see 5.16.2 and 5.16.3)  
A.3.5.2  Once the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment has received a balise group message 
(i.e. once it has received the last balise telegram of  the balise group), the action(s) 
resulting from its content shall take into account the train position measured at the time 
of reception of this last telegram and shall take precedence on any other action related 
to a further location that is reached befo re the message has been fully processed.  
A.3.5.2.1  Example 1: in level 1, the crossing of the EOA/LOA location with the min safe antenna, 
before a new extended MA (received when the min safe antenna was in rear of the 
EOA/LOA) has been processed, will not lead to train trip. In other terms the 
replacement of the EOA/LOA is considered by the on -board as happening before the 
min safe antenna crosses the EOA/LOA location (i.e. preventing that clause 
3.13.10. 2.7 applies).  
A.3.5.2.2  Example 2: when the override function is active, the crossing of the former EOA /LOA  
location by the min safe antenna, before a “Stop if in SR” information (received when 
the min safe antenna was in rear of the former EOA /LOA ) has been processed, will not

Princi ples Page 195/204 
 lead to the end of the overrid e procedure followed by a train trip due to “Stop if in SR”. 
In other terms, both the deletion of the former EOA /LOA  and the end of override 
procedure (see 5.8. 3.1.3 and 5.8.4.1 c)) are considered by the on -board as 
simultaneously happening before the min safe antenna crosses the former EOA/LOA 
location.  
A.3.6 Deletion of accepted and stored information when used  
A.3.6.1  Standard case  
A.3.6.1.1  When the train moves in the direction of its train orientation, storage capacity occupied 
by trackside information  no longer used, i.e., the related on -board functionality has 
been completed, shall be made available immediately.  
A.3.6.1.1.1  Note: The requirement is needed to allow trackside to predict the storage capacity 
available on -board in order to comply with dim ensioning rules regards information 
stored on -board given in Subset 040.  
A.3.6.2 Exception  
A.3.6.2.1  Following information shall remain stored on -board for a distance defined by a fixed 
value in rear of the min safe rear end position of the train:  
 location  dependent static speed restrictions , i.e., SSP, ASP, TSR , LX SR, PBD SR  
(see 3.11.2.2)  
 gradient information,  
 reduced adhesion information received from trackside,  
 Track condition “Big metal masses”.  
A.3.6.2.1.1  Note: The above information remains stored for the case of a reverse movement:  
 With the exception of the track condition “Big metal masses”,  the stored 
information allows the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment to calculate speed 
supervision limits after a reverse movement (roll -away, or initiated by th e driver)  
 Track condition “Big metal masses” is needed also for a reverse movement itself to 
avoid any false alarms due to Big metal masses in the track.  
A.3.6.2.1.2  Note: The distance to intervention of the roll away or reverse movement supervision is 
determined by a National/Default value.  This is also true for a reverse movement in 
Post trip mode. However, following an intervention, the train will not stop immediately. 
In order to keep the on -board functionality simple, a fixed distance value was chose n 
to define an unambiguous location in rear of the train where the above information is 
no longer required and the related on -board storage capacity is made available again.

 A.3.7  Calculation of the basic deceleration  
A.3.7.1  The brake per centage (λ) shall be converted into two different input parameters:  
λo = λ for calculation of emergency brake deceleration (A_brake_emergency(V))  
λo = MIN (λ, 135) for calculation of service brake deceleration (A_brake_service(V))  
where λ is the brake perc entage defined as part of Train Data.  
A.3.7.2  The calculation of the basic deceleration (A_basic(V)) shall use a common algorithm 
that will be used twice, once for the service brake and once for the emergency brake.  
A.3.7.3  The speed limit for the first st ep shall be calculated as V_lim = x * λ oy. 
V_lim is the speed limit for the first step in km/h  
x = 16.85  
y = 0.428  
A.3.7.4  The first step of the basic deceleration shall be calculated as AD_0 = A * λ o + B 
AD_0 is the basic deceleration in m/s2 for 0 ≤ spee d ≤ V_lim.  
A = 0.0075  
B = 0.076  
A.3.7.5  The following steps of the basic deceleration shall be calculated by means of a set of 
polynomials of the third order with the following format:  
AD_n = a3_n * λo3 + a2_n * λo2 + a1_n * λo + a0_n  
and with the followin g values for n (all speed limits in km/h):  
n = 1    valid for V_lim < speed ≤ 100   if V_lim < 100 
to be ignored      if V_lim ≥ 100 
n = 2    valid for V_lim < speed ≤ 120   if 100 < V_lim < 120 
valid for 100 < speed ≤ 120    if V_lim ≤ 100

reference value s for the equivalent brake build up time for the service brake , which 
shall be considered as maximum one s. If justified by the specific brake system of the 
train other values of these coefficients , which lead to shorter value s of the equivalent 
brake build up time  for the service brake , may be used .

A.3.10  Service brake feedback  
A.3.10.1  The purpose of service brake feedback is to reduce the distance between the SBI and 
EBI supervision limits and between the SBI and SBD curves.  
A.3.10.2  The on -board shall consider the service brake feedback as available for use if:  
a) The service brake feedback is implemented, AND  
b) The national value does not inhibit its use.

 A.3.10.3  Two different types of feedback from the service brake are specified, main brake pipe 
pressure and brake cylinder p ressure. The algorithms below are made for main brake 
pipe pressure. When brake cylinder pressure is used instead this shall be converted 
into a fictive main brake pressure value in the following way:  
p = fictive main brake pipe pressure (kPa)  
p_cylinder =  brake cylinder pressure (kPa)  
k1 = vehicle dependent constant (set by engineering of ETCS on -board; k1 is normally 
between 2 .0 and 2 .7) 
p =  500  - p_cylinder / k1  
A.3.10.4  The value of T_bs1 and T_bs2 shall be calculated according to the following algori thm 
to take the service brake feedback into account:  
p = current main brake pipe pressure (or fictive main brake pipe pressure calculated in  
A.3.10.3 ) 
p0 = reference pressure when not braking  
p1 = pressure at which the train starts to brake = p0 - 30  
p2 = pressure limit, under which T_bs1 and T_bs2 are locked = p0 - 60  
p3 = pressure at full service brake = p0 - 150  
Q_feedback_ active  = a Boolean stating whe ther the feedback function is active, i.e. 
once it has started to reduce T_bs1 and T_bs2  until the ceiling speed monitoring is 
entered . 
Q_Tbslocked = a boolean stating whe ther T_bs1 and T_bs2 have been locked to the 
following values  due to enough main brake pipe pressure reduction : 
T_bs1_locked =  0 s.  
T_bs2_locked =  2 s.  
Q_displaylocked_P = a boolean stating whether the displayed permitted speed  is 
locked due to SB feedback.  
Q_displaylocked_SBI = a boolean stating whether th e displayed SBI  speed (if any) is 
locked due to SB feedback.  
Q_displaylocked_TD = a boolean stating whether the displayed target  distance is 
locked due to SB feedback.  
A displayed value is locked from the moment the SB feedback has started to reduce 
T_bs1 and T_bs2 until the calculated value becomes less than the displayed and 
locked value. Note: It is only SB feedback that can start  the locking of the displayed 
values. Once started and still locked it remains locked also in case the calculated 
values are increased due to other reasons (e.g. due to relocation), which will prolong 
the locking period.

The reference pressure p0 (nominal value 500 kPa) shall be set on starting the ETCS:  
 a) To the first stable p value between 400 -550 kPa achieved.  
 b) Stable in this instance means that the pressure has not varied more  than ± 
20 kPa o ver 3 seconds.  
 
 The reference pressure p0 shall thereafter be adapted to the current pressure 
according to the following table (which applies if the calculation is performed once per 
second):  
 
 CONDITIONS:  ACTION:  REMARKS  
a) p = p0  No cha nge Constant pressure  
b) p > p0  p0 = p0 + 1,5  Increasing pressure  
c) p < p0 - 30 No change  Braking  
d) p0 > p > p0 - 30 p0 = p0  0,5 Decreasing pressure  
 
Where:   
- p is limited to max 550 kPa.  
- Values given in kPa.  
 
A.3.10.5  Note: If T_bs1 and T_bs2 h ave been locked to 0s and 2 s  on approaching a non zero 
target , the locking will remain even if the train speed comes below the target speed. 
This avoids “jumping” indications  related to the values of T_bs1 and T_bs2 . It also 
makes it possible to release t he brakes before a speed reduction, without having the 
curves moving back again. It might though result in emergency brake intervention if the 
driver releases the brakes too early. But since EBI is not moved, this is not a safety 
issue. To keep 2 s between  the SBI and EBI enables the service brake to be activated 
first and thus may avoid emergency brake.  
A.3.10.6  Note: If feedback is active  but T_bs1 and T_bs2 are not locked, the feedback function 
will remain active until the ceiling speed monitoring is ent ered. This avoids “jumping” 
indications in some rare situations.

slave engine that is remote controlled.  
4.4.6.1.2  The desk (s) of a sleeping engine must be closed (since there is no driver, no 
information shall be shown).  
4.4.6.1.3  As the engine is remote controlled by the leading engine, its ERTMS/ETCS o n-board 
equipment shall not perform any train movement supervision.  
4.4.6.1.4  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall perform the Train Position function; in 
particular, the front/rear end of the engine (i.e., not the train) shall be used to refer to 
train front/rea r end.  
4.4.6.1.5  Sleeping mode shall be automatically detected on -board via the train interface.  
4.4.6.1.6  If possible, the train must not be stopped due to a safety critical fault in a sleeping 
engine. The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment sh ould therefore try to memorise the 
occurrence of such fault(s), which sh ould be handled when the engine leaves the 
Sleeping mode. The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment sh ould also try to send an 
error information to the RBC.  
4.4.6.1.7  If a desk of the sleeping engine is opened while the train is running (t his is an 
abnormal operation), the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall switch to Stand -By 
mode.  
4.4.6.1.8  If the “sleeping input signal” is lost (no more detection of the remote control), the 
switch to Stand -By mode shall be made only if the train is at standstill.  
4.4.6.1.9  Intentionally deleted . 
4.4.6.1.10  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall open a communication session with the 
RBC when at least one of the following events occur s:

the LRBG.  
In case the LRBG is, due to a change of orientation, in front of the train when the 
distance to run in SR mode is to be determined from the EUROLOOP information, 
the complete distance to run in SR mode shall be determined as the distance 
given by EUROLOOP plus the distance between the estimated train front end and 
the LRBG.  
4.4.11.1.4  Note:  Since the gradient is unknown, the supervision of the braking curves in Staff 
Responsible mode does not ensure that the train will not pass the gi ven distance.  
4.4.11.1.5  The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall give the possibility to the driver to modify 
the value of the SR mode speed limit and of the given distance. This shall be possible 
only at standstill.  
4.4.11.1.5.1  If a train movement is detected while the driver i s entering the SR speed/distance 
limits, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall trigger the brake command.  
4.4.11.1.5.2  The unit, range and resolution of the SR mode speed limit and distance entered

4.4.14.1.2  Once in post trip mode, the onboard equipment shall release the Command of the 
emergency brake.  
4.4.14.1.2.1  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall keep on indicating to the driver the 
reason of the train trip . 
4.4.14.1.3  The train shall only be authorised to move backwards a given distance (national value). 
The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall supervise this national distance for 
reverse movements, and shall command the service brakes if the distance is over -
passed. The dri ver shall be informed about the reason for the brake application.  
4.4.14.1.3.1  Note:  The ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment performs the Reverse Movement 
Protection (as in PT mode, the "normally allowed movement" is backwards, then the 
Reverse Movement Protection avoids the train running in forward direction when in PT 
mode). This implies that the given distance to run backwards in PT is considered as a 
directional data, oriented backwards.  
4.4.14.1.3.2  After the release of a brake command initiated due to an overpassed distance 
allowed f or moving backwards in Post Trip mode, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board

4.4.15.1.1  The N on-Leading mode is defined to manage the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment 
of a slave engine that is NOT electrically coupled to the leading engine (and so, not 
remote controlled) but has its own driver.  
4.4.15.1.1.1  Note: This operating situation is called Tandem.  
4.4.15.1.1.2  The ERT MS/ETCS on -board equipment shall use, as a necessary condition to 
enter in Non -Leading mode, a “non leading input signal" from the train interface.  
4.4.15.1.1.3  If the “non leading input signal" is no longer present, the switch to Stand -By 
mode shall be made only if th e train is at standstill.  
4.4.15.1.2  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall not perform any train movement 
supervision in Non -Leading mode.  
4.4.15.1.3  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall perform the Train Position function; in 
particular, the front/rear end of the engine ( i.e., not the train) shall be used to refer to 
train front/rear end.  
4.4.15.1.4  When level is 2 or 3, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall report its position to 
the RBC, according to the previously received parameters.  
4.4.15.1.5  If possible, the train must not be stopped d ue to a safety critical fault in a non -leading 
engine. The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment sh ould therefore try to memorise the 
occurrence of such fault(s), which sh ould be handled when the engine leaves Non 
Leading mode. The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment sh ould also try to send an

 4.4.18  REVERSING  
4.4.18.1  Description  
4.4.18.1.1  The Reversing mode allows the driver to change the direction of movement of the train 
and drive from the same cab, i.e. the train orientation remains unchanged. This is 
possible only in areas so marked by trackside.  
4.4.18.1.2  Note: This mode is used to allow the train to escape from a dangerous situation and to 
reach as fast as possible a “safer” location.  
4.4.18.1.3  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall supervise train movements against : 
a) a ceiling speed : the Rev ersing mode speed limit  given from trackside  
b) a distance to run in the direction opposite to the train orientation , given from 
trackside. The emergency brake shall be commanded if overpassing this distance  
4.4.18.1.4  After the release of a brake command initiated due to an overpassed reversing 
distance, and while the reversing distance is still overpassed, the ERTMS/ETCS on -
board equipment shall command the emergency brake for any further movement in the 
direction opposite to the train orientation . 
4.4.18.1.5  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall display the train speed, the permitted 
speed and  the remaining distance to run . 
4.4.18.1.6  In case the SBI supervision limit is exceeded (refer to chapter 3  table 5, triggering 
condition t4), the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall command the eme rgency 
brake  instead of the service brake . For the revocation of the brake command, refer to 
3.13.10.2.4.  
4.4.18.1.7  The position reports sent when in reversing mode shall refer to the location of the 
driving cab (as before reversing).  
4.4.18.1.8  Note:  The ERTMS/ETCS onboard eq uipment performs the Reverse Movement 
Protection (as in RV mode, the "normally allowed movement" is backwards, then the 
Reverse Movement Protection avoids the train running in forward direction when in RV 
mode). This implies that the given distance to run in reversing is considered as a 
directional data, oriented backwards.  
4.4.18.1.9  Note: for the list of main functions related to this mode, refer to chapter  4.5 “Modes

of the train movement  to the extent permitted by the information provided by trackside.  
4.4.19.3.1.1  Note: The Limited Supervision mode enables the train to be operated in areas 
equipped with lineside signals where ETCS does not have information regarding t he 
status of some signals, i.e. not all signals are fitted with LEUs or connected to an RBC  
4.4.19.3.2  The driver must always observe the existing line -side information (signals, speed 
boards etc.)  and National operating rules . 
4.4.19.3.2.1  Note: the indications given to the driv er by the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 
equipment do not substitute the observance of the line -side information. In particular

 4.4.20  PASSIVE  SHUNTING  
4.4.20.1  Description  
4.4.20.1.1  The Passive Shunting mode is defined to manage the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 
equipment of a slave engine (NOT remote controlled, but mechanically coupled to the 
leading engine) , being part of a shunting consist. This mode can also be used to carry 
on a shunting movement with a s ingle engine fitted with one on -board equipment and 
two cabs, when the driver has to change the driving cab . 
4.4.20.1.2  The desk of a Passive Shunting engine  must be closed (since there is no driver, no 
information shall be shown).  
4.4.20.1.3  As the engine is coupled to a leading engine, its ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment 
shall not perform any train movement supervision.  
4.4.20.1.4  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall perform Train Position function;  in 
particular, the front/rear end of the engine (i.e., not the train) shall be used to refer to 
train front/rear end.  
4.4.20.1.5  It shall only be possible to enter in Passive Shunting mode from the Shunting mode; 
while in Shunting mode, the driv er shall have the possibility to enable the function 
“Continue Shunting on desk closure” . 
4.4.20.1.6  When the active desk is closed, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall switch to 
Passive Shunting mode  if the function “Continue Shunting on desk closure” is active 
and the “passive shunting input signal” is received from the train interface. If the 
function “Continue Shunting on desk closure” is not active or the “passive shunting 
input signal” is not present, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall switch to 
Stand -By mode instead.  
4.4.20.1.7  The special function “Continue Shunting on desk closure” shall allow one and only one 
transition from Shunting mode to Passive Shunting mode. The special function shall be 
inactive once the Shunting mode is left.  
4.4.20.1.8  If a desk of the Passive Sh unting engine is opened  and no “Stop Shunting on desk 
opening” information previously received from balise group is stored onboard , the 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall switch to Shunting mode.  
4.4.20.1.9  If a desk of the Passive Shunting engine is opened and “Sto p Shunting on desk 
opening” information previously received from balise group is stored onboard, the 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall switch to Stand By mode.  
4.4.20.1.10  If possible, the train must not be stopped due to a safety critical fault in a Passive 
Shuntin g engine. The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment sh ould therefore try to 
memorise the occurrence of such fault(s), which sh ould be handled when the engine 
leaves the Passive Shunting mode.

 4.4.20.1.11  When in Passive Shunting mode, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board shall not manage level 
transitions. However, an immediate level transition order or a conditional level 
transition order shall be stored and shall be evaluated only when another mode than 
Shunting or Passive Shunting has been entered  (i.e. when the Shunting movement is 
terminated ). 
4.4.20.1.12  When receiving a communication session establishment order, the ERTMS/ETCS on -
board in Passive Shunting mode shall not establish the communication session, but 
shall store the RBC ID/phone number information.  
4.4.20.1.13  When in Passive Shunting mode, the ER TMS/ETCS on -board shall not manage RBC -
RBC hand -over, except for storing the RBC ID/phone number information given at the 
RBC/RBC border.  
4.4.20.1.14  Note: for the list of main functions related to this mode, refer to chapter 4.5 “Modes 
and on-board  functions” . 
4.4.20.1.15  In cas e of balise group message consistency error (refer to 3.16.2.4.4 and 3.16.2.5.1), 
the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment shall not command the service brake.  
4.4.20.2  Used in levels  
4.4.20.2.1  Used in all levels: Level 0, level 1, level 2, level 3 and level NTC 
4.4.20.3  Responsibilities  
4.4.20.3.1  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment of an engine in Passive Shunting mode has 
no responsibility for the train protection.  
4.4.20.3.2  The notion of responsibility of the driver is not relevant for the Passive Shunting mode.  
4.4.20.3.3  Note : The leading engine is responsible for the m ovement of the train. It is then the 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment of the leading engine that is fully/partially/not 
responsible for the train protection, with respect to its mode.

4.5.1  Introduction  
4.5.1.1  The following table specifies in which modes the on -board functions are active or not. 
The functions are described in the “Related SRS §” (second column of the table).  
4.5.1.2  Note:  Modes are not the only thing that can influence an onboard function. This is why 
this Table is not enough in itself  to understand all the ERTMS/ETCS onboard 
behaviour. It must be understood as a complement to all other SRS chapters 
(especially §4.7, 4.8, 4.9 and 4.10).  
4.5.1.3  Note:  for DMI depending on modes, refer to §4.7.  
4.5.2  Active Functions Table  
4.5.2.1  X = functions shall be active  
Empty case = function shall be inactive  
O = Optional (function is not required for interoperability, but is not forbidden)

 4.6 Transitions between modes  
4.6.1  Symbols  
4.6.1.1  The indication “ 4>” means: The condition n°4 must be fulfilled to trigger the transitio n 
4.6.1.2  From the mode located in the column  
4.6.1.3  To the mode that is indicated by the arrow “ >”. 
4.6.1.4  Each transition from a given mode receives a priority order (indicated by “ -px-”, x is the 
priority order) to avoid a conflict between the different transitions when they  occur at 
the same time (i.e. in the same clock cycle). P1 has a higher priority than P2.  
4.6.1.5  Some transitions have received the same priority order. This has been decided when it 
is obvious that these transitions cannot occur at the same time, and so can neve r lead 
to a conflicting situation (for example, the RBC cannot give in the same time a MA for 
FS and a MA for OS to a given engine, this is why the transition “from SR to FS” and 
the transition “from SR to OS” have the same priority order).  
4.6.1.6  "16, 17, 18" me ans "16 or 17 or 18".

 4.7 DMI depending on modes  
4.7.1  Introduction  
4.7.1.1  The DMI is an interface  that allows the direct exchange of information between the 
driver and the ERTMS/ETCS onboard eq uipment.  The indirect exchange of information 
done via the train interface (e.g. a driver’s action on the service brake used for the 
service brake feedback, opening/closing the desk) is not part of the DMI.  
4.7.1.2  The device(s) used to select “ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment powered/unpowered” 
is (are) not part of the DMI . 
4.7.1.3  The device(s) used to select /indicate  “ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment isolated/not 
isolated” is (are) part of the DMI . 
4.7.1.4  Intentionally deleted . 
4.7.1.5  Information (input or output) only relevant for National System  and not originated by 
the ERTMS/ETCS on -board is not included in the following section.  
4.7.2  DMI versus Mode Table  
4.7.2.1.1  X = active: For a  DMI output, this means that the output information shall be shown to 
the driver when the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment is in the mode indicated in the 
column. For a  DMI input, this means that it shall be possible for the driver to enter this 
information when the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment is in the mode indicated in the 
column).  
4.7.2.1.2  A = available: This means that the input/outp ut shall become active ONLY if another 
condition(s) is (are) fulfilled. This condition(s) are not described here.  
4.7.2.1.3  Grey cells: availability and meaning defined by national system.  
4.7.2.1.4  NA = Not Applicable: This concerns the modes SF and IS in which the DMI input s and 
outputs cannot be determined.

 4.8 Acceptance of received information  
4.8.1  Introduction  
4.8.1.1  The aim of this chapter is to give an overview o f which information is accepted  or 
rejected depending on the state of the on -board (level, mode) and the nature of the 
received inf ormation ( transmission medium, type of information: infill  or non -infill). 
4.8.1.2  The following sections have to be interpreted by applying the filters as shown in Figure 
3. The first filter is detailed in section 4.8.3 “Accepted information depending on the 
level and transmission media”, the third filter in section 4.8.4 “Accepted information 
depending on the modes”.  
4.8.1.3  If a message contains level transition information, any other information in that 
message shall be evaluated considering  the level transition inform ation.  
4.8.1.3.1  Information received in the same message as an immediate level transition order or a 
conditional level transition order that causes a level transition  shall be evaluated first 
considering the on -board currently operated level, as if a level transiti on order for 
further location had been received (i.e. conditions [1] , [2] or [6]  of Figure 3, if applied, 
shall be automatically fulfilled). Then, if relevant, it shall be immediately extracted from 
the buffer and re -evaluated according to the new selected  level.  
4.8.1.4  Note:  As shown in Figure 3, information stored following an announcement of a 
change of level, is re -checked for acceptance when the level has changed. This 
implies that, when the level changes, the mode is - for a short moment – still 
unchanged, u ntil the stored information has been processed. The consequence for the 
Third Filter is that information needs to be accepted for this short period also in modes 
in which this information is otherwise useless.  
4.8.1.5  If a message contains infill information, this  latter shall be evaluated considering  all 
other non -infill information in that message.  
4.8.1.6  When evaluating trackside information received by radio or when re -evaluating a set of 
information released from the transition buffer, linking information, if any, sh all be 
evaluated prior to any other location related information .

 4.8.2  Assumptions  
4.8.2.1  The following tables shall be applied assum ing that: 
a) the information complies with the system version checks (see section 3.17.3) and 
with the data consistency checks.(see section 3.16)  
b) the direction for which the information is valid matches the current train orientation, 
or the balise group crossing d irection (for SL , PS and SH engines).(see section 
3.6.3)  
c) In levels 2/3, it is assumed that the “RBC” information which is marked “A” 
(Accepted) comes from the supervising RBC (see RBC/RBC handover). If this 
information is received from the “Accepting” RBC while the “Handing Over” RBC is 
still responsible, it is stored onboard until the RBC transition is performed  
Exception  1: The information “Acknowledgement of Train Data”, “ Trackside 
constituent system version ”, "Session Management" and “Acknowledgement of  
Session Termination" shall be immediately accepted.  
Exception  2: The information “Co -operative shortening of MA” , “Revocation of 
Emergency Stop” and “LSSMA display toggle on/off order” shall be rejected.  
d) to check exception [4] in 4.8.3, the track descript ion is referred to the LRBG  (i.e. 
relocation has been performed see 3.6.4.3) . 
e) the information from balise is received while no reverse movement is performed 
(see clause 3.14.3.6)  
4.8.2.2  Regarding 4.8.2.1 a): In case a balise is missed or a balise telegram cannot be 
decoded, the information “ Inhibition of balise group message consistency reaction”  is 
only used by the on -board equipment to inhibit the service brake reaction, while the 
balise group message is rejected. If all the telegrams from a balise group are cor rectly 
read, the information “ Inhibition of balise group message consistency reaction” , if 
received, shall be ignored by the on -board equipment. Therefore this information need 
not to be referre d to i n the following tables.  
4.8.2.3  In case a balise telegram contai ns the information VBC marker and a country/region 
identity that both match a stored VBC, the whole balise telegram is ignored and any 
further check in relation to this balise telegram is irrelevant (refer to 3.15.9. 3 b)). 
Otherwise the information VBC mar ker, if included in a consistent balise group 
message , shall al ways be ignored by the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment and  need 
not to be referred to in the following tables . 
4.8.2.4  Note: with the exception of the data that is forwarded to a National System through the 
STM interface (see 3.15.6 and SUBSET -035), what will happen to the data to be used 
by applications outside ERTMS/ETCS  (e.g. whether it is discarded, forwarded to an 
external application, processed by a national function…) is outside the scope of this 
specification and is assumed as not being part of the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 
functionality .

 4.8.5  Handling of transition buffer in case of level transition announcement or 
RBC/RBC handover  
4.8.5.1  If an order to switch to level NTC, 1, 2 or 3  at a further location has been received , the 
ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment shall be able to store in a transition buffer (see 
figure 3, first filter) three  sets of information obtained from three  filtered messages.  
4.8.5.2  If a RBC transition order has been received and the Handing Over RBC is still the 
supervising one, the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment shall be  able to store in a 
transition buffer (see figure 3, second filter) three sets of information obtained from 
three filtered messages from the Accepting RBC.  
4.8.5.2.1  Note: t he term “set of information” refers to the part of a message being stored in the 
transition b uffer (i.e. information which is neither accepted nor rejected immediately) 
according to the conditions stated in 4.8.3.1 [1] and [2] (for level transition) or 
according to 4.8.2. 1c (for RBC/RBC handover) . 
4.8.5.3  In case three sets of information are already stor ed in the transition buffer , any new set 
to be stored shall replace the oldest one currently stored.  
4.8.5.4  The sets of information stored in the transition buffer shall be deleted : 
a) in case  the level transition order is deleted or overwritten by another level tra nsition 
order for a different level, OR  
b) in case  the RBC transition order is deleted or overwritten by an order to switch to 
another Accepting RBC , OR 
c) in case the communication session with the RBC that provided the stored 
information is terminated  
4.8.5.5  At the s ame time the level transition is performed or at the same time the Accepting 
RBC becomes the supervising one, the sets of information stored in the transition 
buffer shall be released and re -evaluated in the sequence they have been received.  
4.8.5.6  This sequentia l re-evaluation of all the released information shall be a prerequisite to 
any use by the on -board equipment (e.g. it will lead neither to an intermediate change 
of mode nor to a change of information displayed to the driver) and shall obey the 
following p rinciples:  
a) Starting from the information currently used by on -board at the moment the 
level/RBC transition is effective, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall 
determine the new information for train supervision, by performing sequential 
updates from the information released from the transition buffer, if accepted.  
b) For each information update related to a re -evaluated set of information, the same 
rules shall apply as to information update related to new information accepted 
outside a level/RBC transition c ontext.

Chapter 4 : Modes and Transitio ns Page 69/75 
 c) The information resulting from this sequential update shall then be used by the 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment . 
4.8.5.7  Accepting re -evaluated Conditional Emergency Stop information according to table 
4.8.3 implies that the accepted Conditional Emergency St op information may be 
accepted or rejected in a further step (see clause 3.10.2.2) depending on the given 
stop location. This decision , based on the comparison between the min safe front end 
position of the train at the time the message was received and th e given stop location,  
shall be  considered part of the evaluation process as it affects the further re -evaluation 
of information stored in the transition buffer (see clause 3.10.2.4).  
4.8.5.7.1  Note: For the case of the Unconditional Emergency Stop information accep ting the 
information according to table 4.8.3 will always lead to the train being tripped (see 
clause  3.10.2.3) when re -evaluation of the transition buffer is completed . Information 
accepted during re -evaluation of information stored in the transition buff er can then be 
affected on transition to TR mode according to conditions in Table 4.10.  
4.8.5.8  Note: The requirement to acknowledge an Emergency Stop information according to 
clause 3.10.1.4, i.e., communicating to the RBC if the information has been accepted 
(Conditional or Unconditional Emergency Stop)  or rejected because the train has 
passed the stop location (Conditional Emergency Stop only) , applies to the time when 
the information is used , immediately after the sequential update has been completed.  
Regards a cknowledging the reception of an emergency stop message, as for any 
other information received from trackside, see clause 3.16.3.5.

4.11.1.3  If a cold movement has been detected, or the Cold Movement Detection function  is not 
able to confirm that no cold move ment has taken place, no change of status of 
information to “valid” shall be made until it has been validated by a different means 
than cold movement detection .

 5.3 Introduction  
5.3.1  Scope and Purpose  
5.3.1.1  This document defines the procedures that are necessary for interoperability within the 
scope of ERTMS/ETCS.  
5.3.1.2  Each procedure is defined by a set of mandatory requirements and , where convenient, 
is illustrated by a flowchart.  
5.3.1.3  In case the condition(s) in chapter 4 triggering a mode transition is(are) fulfilled, this 
transition shall be executed even if not shown in the chapter 5 procedures . 
5.3.1.3.1  Note: Such a mode transition could lead to exit ing a procedure immediately (e. g. cut 
off power of on -board equipment, isolation of on -board equipment).  
5.3.1.4  National operation rules (outside of ERTMS/ETCS) are also excluded, but may be 
applied by the railways in addition to the procedures as long as interoperability is 
retained.  
5.3.2  Definitions  
5.3.2.1  Procedu res 
A procedure defines the required reaction of the ERTMS/ETCS entities (subsystems 
and components) to either information exchanged between ERTMS/ETCS entities or 
events (triggered by external entities or internal events). The procedures focus on the 
required change in status and mode of the described ERTMS/ETCS entities.  
5.3.2.2  Entities  
The procedures define the required system behaviour on a context level, i. e. the 
entities that are used to define the procedures are for example: the on -board 
equipment, the tra ckside equipment (RBC/Balise), the driver.  
5.3.2.3  States  
States are situations of an ETCS subsystem with a specific set of available functions 
and a specific set of events that may start or terminate the state. A state remains 
active as long as the conditions to trigger the transition to a succeeding state are not 
completely satisfied.  
Note 1: one mode of operation may include several states for the on -board equipment.  
Note 2: A new state is only created, if the behaviour of the system differs from another 
one. P ossession of information (e. g. location information) or not does not force 
branching in states.

 Transitions define the rules for passing from one state to another. A transition is 
triggered by a set of conditions which has to be fulfilled in a  defined order or at the 
same time.  When a transition refers to a driver’s selection, it means that the conditions 
to enable the corresponding button on the DMI were fulfilled.

 5.4 Procedure Start of mission  
5.4.1  Introduction  
5.4.1.1  The driver may have to start a mission : 
a) Once the train is awake, OR  
b) Once shunting movements are finished, OR  
c) Once a mission is ended, OR  
d) Once a slave engine becomes a leading engine.  
5.4.1.2  The common point of all these situations is that the ERTMS/ETCS on -board is in 
Stand -By mode, but the Start of Mission will be different, since some data may be 
already stored on -board, depending on the previous situation.  
5.4.1.3  Once the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment is in Stand -By mode, the start of mission 
is not the only possibility, the engine may be come  remote contr olled ( i.e. the on -board 
switches to Sleeping  mode ). 
5.4.2  Status of data stored in the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment  
5.4.2.1  At the beginning of the Start of Mission procedure, the data required may be in one of 
three states:  
a) “valid” (the stored value is known to be c orrect)  
b) “Invalid” (the stored value may be wrong)  
c) “Unknown”  (no stored value available)  
5.4.2.2  This refers to the following data: Driver ID, ERTMS/ETCS level, RBC ID/phone 
number, Train Data, Train Running Number, Train Position ( see 3.6.1.3 ). 
5.4.2.3  Note 1 :  The status  of data in relation to the previous and the actual mode is described 
in chapter 4, section "What happens to stored information when entering a mode".  
5.4.2.4  Note 2 : The change of status of data in course of the procedure is shown in the table 
in section 5.4.3.3 . 
5.4.3  Table of requirements for “Start of Mission” procedure  
5.4.3.1  The ID numbers in the table are used for the representation of the procedure in form of 
a flow chart in section 5.4.4 .

 5.4.3.2  Procedure  
ID # Requir ements  
S0 The Start of Mission procedure shall be engaged when the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 
equipment is in Stand -By mode with a desk open and no communication session is 
established  or is being established . 
S1 Depending on the status of the Driver -ID, the ER TMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall 
request the driver to enter the Driver -ID (if the Driver -ID is unknown) or shall request 
the driver to revalidate or re -enter the Driver -ID (if the Driver -ID is invalid).  
The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall offer the d river the possibility to 
enter /re-validate  (depending on the status) the Train running number.  
The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall also offer the driver the possibility to 
set/remove a Virtual Balise Cover.  
Once the Driver -ID is entered or revalidated (E1) (possibly further to the Train running 
number entry/revalidation and/or to Virtual Balise Cover setting/removal ), the process 
shall go to D2 
D2 If both the stored position and the stored level  are valid, the process shall go to D3 
If the stored posit ion or the stored level is “invalid ” or “unknown ”, the process shall go 
to S2 
D3 If the stored level is 2 or 3, the process shall go to D7 
If the stored level is 0,1 or NTC, the process shall go to S10 
D7 If at least one Mobile Terminal is registered to a Radio Network, the process shall go 
to A31 
If no Mobile Terminal is registered to a Radio Network, the process shall go to S4 
S2 If the status of the Level data is "unknown", the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment 
shall request the driver to enter it.  
If the  status of the Level data is "invalid", the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall 
request the driver to re -validate or re -enter the ERTMS/ETCS level.  
If the entered / re -validated level is 2 or 3, the process shall go to S3 
If the entered / re -validated leve l is 0 , 1 or one of proposed NTC level(s) (see 3.18.4.2 
for the levels the driver is allowed to select) , the process shall go to S10

S3 The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall offer the possibility to the driver to re -
enter the Radio Network ID. If the d river elects to do so, the on -board equipment shall 
terminate the ongoing communication session, if any. As soon as the related safe 
connection is released, the on -board equipment shall acquire an alphanumeric list of 
available and allowed networks, based on a request to the Mobile Terminal(s):

ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment to use the last stored RBC -ID/phone 
number  
 Order the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment to use the EIRENE short 
number (trackside call ro uting function)  
 Enter the RBC -ID/phone number (if its status is "unknown"), or revalidate/re -
enter it (if its status is “invalid”  or “valid” ). 
Once the driver has selected the first or second option or once data is validated ( E5), 
the process shall go to A31

not be en taken into account for the design of the SoM flowchart. However, should such 
a fault occur above D11 the nominal procedure applies (refer to D11 in flowchart). On 
the other hand, if it occurs in any step further than D11, the process shall go to S10.  
5.4.5.2  The SoM flowchart described in section 5.4.3 only includes the main paths and does 
not exhaustively cover the various operational situations, which could occur while 
performing the SoM procedure (e.g. when revised instructions are given to the driver or 
when  the driver needs to re -enter already captured data).  
5.4.5.3  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall also offer the driver the following 
possibilities, in addition to the ones that are described in section 5.4.3:  
a) only at S10 and S20 and if the conditions defined in 5.8.2.1 for Stand By are 
fulfilled , to select “Override”. If the driver chooses to do so, then the process shall 
go to the procedure “Override” and, if the position is still invalid, the ERTMS/ETCS 
on-board shall delete the train position data (new stat us: “unknown”)  
b) only at S10 and S20,  to re-enter the Driver -ID 
c) only at S10 and S20, to re-enter the “Train running number”  
d) only at S20,  to re-enter the Train data . If the driver chooses to do so , then the 
process shall go to S12.  
e) only at S10 and S20, to re -enter the Level. If the driver chooses to do so, t hen the 
process shall go to S2  
f) only at S20, to select “Non Leading”. If the driver chooses to do so, then the 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall immediately switch to Non Leading mode 
and, if the position i s still invalid, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board shall delete the train 
position data (new status: “unknown”).  
g) only at S20, to select “Shunting”. If the driver chooses to do so, then the process 
shall go to the procedure “Shunting initiated by driver” and, if the position is still 
invalid, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board shall delete the train position data (new status: 
“unknown”). If, in level 2 or 3, the RBC rejects the request for Shunting, the process 
shall go back to S20.  
h) only at S10, if valid Train Data is available,  to select “Start”. If the driver chooses to 
do so:  
 if the level is 0, then the process shall go to S23.  
 if the level is NTC, then the process shall go to S22.  
 if the level is 1, then the process shall go to S24.

 5.5 Procedure End of Mission  
5.5.1  Introduction  
5.5.1.1  End of mission refers to the situation where the trackside stops to authorise the 
movement of a unit. End of mission is initiated by the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 
equipment when entering specific modes (see below).  
5.5.2  Entry to Mode Considered as an End of Mission:  
5.5.2.1  Stand -By mode  
5.5.2.1.1  From FS, LS, OS, UN, NL,  SR, PT, RV or SN mode, the entry of the ERTMS/ ETCS 
on-board equipment into the Stand -by mode is considered as an End of Mission  
5.5.2.1.2  Note: While in SN mode (level  NTC), some other conditions to end the mission may 
depend on the National System . 
5.5.2.1.3  The entry of the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment into the S tand-by mode, from PT 
mode, is only considered as an End of Mission if there was an ongoing mission . 
5.5.2.2  Intentionally deleted  
5.5.2.3  Shunting mode  
5.5.2.3.1  The entry of the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment into the Shunting mode, from FS, 
LS, OS, SR, SN or UN mode, is considered as an End of Mission.  
5.5.2.3.2  The entry of the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment into the Shunting mode, from PT 
mode, is only considered as an End of Mission if there was an ongoing mission.  
5.5.2.3.3  Note: While in SN mode (level  NTC), some other conditions to end the mission ma y 
depend on the National System . 
5.5.3  End of Mission Procedure  
5.5.3.1  The procedure comprises the following steps  
5.5.3.1.1  Step 1 - MA, Track Description Data and Train Data may be deleted (mode 
dependent, see Chapter 4, section "What happens to accepted and stored information  
when Entering a Mode") .

 5.7 Entry in Shunting with Order from Trackside  
5.7.1  General Requirements  
5.7.1.1  This procedure is used to allow the entry of a train into a shunting area.  
5.7.1.2  Note: The shunting area, possibly including a “safety envelope”, can be already 
occupied by shunting units,  not controlled by the trackside. It is therefore possible that 
the train shall enter into the shunting area in OS mode. The switch to OS is performed 
according to the relevant procedure.   
5.7.1.3  The order to switch to SH mode shall be given by means of a mode p rofile, optionally 
with a list of balises  groups , which the train can pass when the ERTMS/ETCS on -
board equipment is in shunting mode.  
5.7.1.4  The switch to shunting, if the transition to shunting was ordered by trackside, requires 
a driver acknowledgement, accord ing to the specifications below.  
5.7.1.5  When the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment has switched to Shunting mode, End of 
Mission, according to chapter 5.5.2.3 , is performed.  
5.7.2  Shunting is requested for the current location (from modes diffe rent from 
Stand By and Post Trip)  
5.7.2.1  In a level 1 area, or at the border from a level 0 to a level 1 area, the beginning of the 
shunting area can be the location where a balise group is installed. In level 2/3 it is 
possible to send an ERTMS/ETCS on -board equ ipment the order to switch to shunting 
at the current location.  
5.7.2.2  Shunting is requested for the current location means that, according to the mode 
profile received the max safe front end of the train is at or in advance of the location for 
which switching to  SH mode is requested.  
5.7.2.3  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall switch immediately to SH mode and a 
request for acknowledgement shall be displayed to the driver (refer to SRS chapter 4, 
transitions between modes).  
5.7.2.4  If the driver does not acknowledge within t he driver acknowledgement time (refer to 
Appendix A .3.1) after the change to SH mode, the service brake command shall be 
triggered. The command shall be released as soon as the driver acknowledges (unless 
the command was triggered also for other reasons).  
5.7.3  Shunting is requested for a further location  
5.7.3.1  An order to switch to SH at a further location can be sent  
a) in a level 1 area by a balise group,

Procedures  Page 29/100 
 b) in a level 2 or 3 area by the RBC.  
5.7.3.2  A request for acknowledgement shall be displayed to the driver, when the followi ng two 
conditions are fulfilled:  
a) the distance between the estimated front end of the train and the beginning of 
shunting area is shorter than a value, contained in the mode profile  
b) the speed is lower than the Shunting mode speed limit (National Value, or v alue 
given in the mode profile)  
5.7.3.3  Once the request for acknowledgement is displayed, it shall not be taken back, even if 
the above conditions are no more fulfilled (e.g., the train accelerates).  
5.7.3.4  Until the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment has switched to SH mode , the beginning 
of the shunting area shall be considered as the E OA (instead of the EOA/LOA derived 
from the MA)  and the SvL (with no release speed) shall be determined according to the 
mode profile either:  
a) as the SvL derived from the MA. In case the MA de fines an LOA, the SvL shall be 
derived as if no LOA had been given.  
OR 
b) as the beginning of the shunting area.  
5.7.3.5  When the driver acknowledges, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall 
immediately switch to SH mode (refer to chapter 4, transitions between modes ). 
5.7.3.6  If the max safe front end of the train reaches the beginning of the shunting area 
according the mode profile and the driver has not yet acknowledged, the 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall switch immediately to SH mode and a 
request for acknowledgement  shall be displayed to the driver (refer to SRS chapter 4, 
transitions between modes).  
5.7.3.7  If, in this case, the driver does not acknowledge within the driver acknowledgement 
time (refer to Appendix A .3.1) after the change to SH mode, the service brake 
command  shall be triggered. The command shall be released as soon as the driver 
acknowledges (unless the command was triggered also for other reasons).  
5.7.4  Shunting from Stand By or Post Trip mode  
5.7.4.1  When performing a SoM or a Train Trip procedure and when the current l evel is 2 or 3, 
the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment can receive a mode profile giving an Shunting 
area which the train has already entered with its max safe front end. In this case, the 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall first require an acknowledgement fro m the 
driver.  
5.7.4.2  When the driver acknowledges, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall perfo rm 
transition to Shunting mode.

 5.8 Procedure Override  
5.8.1  Introduction  
5.8.1.1  In specific degraded situations (for example in the case of a failed signal, failed track 
circuit, failed point…), railways allow a train to pass its End of Movement Authority . 
5.8.1.2  For ERTMS/ETCS, passing an End of Movement Authority  can be required in 
degraded situations, e.g.  
 In level 2/3, if a train is stopped without MA in a location where radio is unavailable 
(e.g. after having received an emergency message, or after a train trip).  
 In level 2/3, if a train is stopped at the  border between two adjacent RBCs (e.g. the 
interface between RBCs is unavailable).  
 In level 2/3, if a train is stopped after having passed the border between two 
adjacent RBCs (e.g. the connection to the Accepting RBC cannot be established).  
 In level 2/3,  if the RBC is unable to give a permission to run (e.g. lost connection 
with the interlocking)  
 In level 1, if a signal cannot show a proceed aspect (e.g., signal failure, route 
cannot be set)  
 In level 1, if a train is stopped without MA (e.g. after the MA has been shortened 
due to a time -out). 
5.8.1.3  In level 0 /NTC  areas, passing a signal at danger is only a national procedure. The 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment is not involved in this procedure, since it does not 
supervise the train movements.  
5.8.1.4  In ERTMS equipped ar eas (level 1, 2 or 3), locations where the train shall stop are 
supervised by the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment. Receiving an order from the 
signalman to pass the End of Movement Authority , the driver must then be able to 
inhibit this supervision.  
5.8.1.4.1  Note:  The driver must not use the “Override” procedure unless authorised by trackside 
personnel. This authorisation  is covered by operational procedures.  
5.8.1.5  If a signal at danger  must be passed between announcement and execution of the 
level transition from an unfitt ed area (level 0) or from an area fitted with a National 
System (level NTC) to an ERTMS equipped area (level 1, 2, 3), the signalman gives 
the order to the driver to select “override”.  
5.8.1.6  Note : By using this procedure the driver is fully responsible for the t rain driving. 
Therefore Staff Responsible mode is entered when the driver selects “override”.  
5.8.1.7  In addition the procedure allows to avoid a train trip when passing a balise group:  
a) transmitting "stop if in SR mode"

 b) not contained in the list of expected balis es in SR mode  
c) transmitting "stop if in SH mode"  
d) not contained in the list of expected balises in SH mode"  
e) Intentionally deleted  
5.8.1.8  Further, the Override procedure allows a train in SR mode reaching the end of the SR 
distance to proceed (see also 4.4.11.1.4 ) 
5.8.2  Selection of “Override”  
5.8.2.1  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall allow the driver to select “Override” only 
when:  
a) The train speed is under or equal to the speed limit for triggering the “override” 
function (national value) AND  
b) The current mode is Full Superv ision, Limited Supervision, On Sight, Staff 
Responsible, Shunting, Unfitted, Post Trip, Stand By (in level 2/3 only)  or S N 
(National  System)  AND  
c) Validated Train Data and Train running number are  available (except when already 
in Shunting mode).  
5.8.2.2  Intentional ly deleted . 
5.8.2.3  The “Override” procedure shall be triggered when selected by the driver.  
5.8.3  Once the “Override” procedure has been triggered  
5.8.3.1  The mode shall change as follows:  
a) If the current mode is Full Supervision, Limited Supervision, On Sight, Stand -By or 
Post Trip, the mode shall immediately switch to the Staff Responsible (SR) mode (if 
the mode is already SR it remains unchanged)  
b) If the current mode is Shunting the mode shall remain unchanged  
c) If the current mode is Unfitted (level 0 area) or S N (level NTC are a) the mode shall 
only change to Staff Responsible when the level changes to 1,2 or 3 (refer to SRS 
chapter 4, transitions between modes)  
5.8.3.1.1  If the mode, when activating Override, is OS , LS or FS, the former EOA /LOA  shall be 
retained. If the mode is SB or PT,  the current position of the train front shall be 
considered as the former EOA /LOA . 
5.8.3.1.2  Note: This former EOA /LOA  will be used as a Trip condition if the Override function  is 
no longer active. Any further activation of the Override in SR mode has no effect on 
the former EOA /LOA .

 5.8.3.1.3  The former EOA /LOA  shall be deleted  if: 
a) the train reads the information “stop if in SR mode” from a balise group OR  
b) SR mode is left.  
5.8.3.2  Note 1:  In level 2, 3, if radio communication is available, the RBC is only informed that 
the Override has been triggered by means of the reported mode change (if there is 
any) 
5.8.3.3  Note 2: In level 2,3, if the ERTMS/ETCS - onboard equipment is able to report the 
mode change to the RBC, the RBC may transmit limits for the distance to run in SR 
mode (overriding th e national value), a  list of balises to be passed in SR mode (refer 
to chapter 4, Staff Responsible mode)  
5.8.3.4  Note  3: In level 2,3, the transition to SR mode triggered by selecting Override revokes 
all emergency stop orders previously received.  
5.8.3.5  In SR mode the  driver may modify the value of the SR mode speed limit and of the 
distance to run in SR mode (refer to chapter 4, Staff Responsible mode)  
5.8.3.6   The train trip shall be inhibited (suppression of the transition to the Trip mode), and 
only in level 0, 1, 2, 3, the MRSP shall include the Override function related Speed 
Restriction  (see 3.11.10) as long as the Override function is active . 
5.8.3.7  The status “override active” shall be indicated to the driver.  
5.8.3.7.1  Exception 1: In case the Override function has been activated by a n STM (see 
SUBSET -035), the status “override active” shall not be indicated to the driver . 
5.8.3.7.2  Exception 2: In case the Override function has been activated by selection of 
“Override” while being in level 0, 1, 2 or 3, the status “override active” shall stop t o be 
indicated to the driver on executing a transition to level NTC . 
5.8.3.8  As long as the Override function is active, new SR distance information received from 
EUROLOOP shall be rejected.  
5.8.3.9  When “Override” is selected and Override is already active , the supervisi on of the time 
and distance (see 5.8.4.1 a) and b)) for train trip suppression  shall be re -started . 
5.8.4  End of Override procedure  
5.8.4.1  The Override procedure  shall end when at least one of the following conditions is 
fulfilled:  
a) The "max. time for train trip suppres sion when Override function is triggered" 
(national value) elapses after Override has been selected , OR 
b) The train has run more than the "distance for train trip suppression when Override 
function is triggered" (national value)  after Override has been selec ted, OR

 5.9 Procedure On -Sight  
5.9.1  General Requirements  
5.9.1.1  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall be in On Sight mode before the train 
reaches the beginning of the On Sight area or, at the latest, when the train reaches the 
beginning of the On Sight area.  
5.9.1.2  An acknowledgement for running in On Sight mode is requested from the driver. The 
conditions of the acknowledgement are specified below.  
5.9.2  On Sight is requested for current location (from modes different from 
Stand By and Post Trip)  
5.9.2.1  In a level 1 area, the beginning of the On Sight area can be the balise (group) that 
gives the Mode Profile. When the train passes the balise group and receives thi s 
information, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall immediately switch to On 
Sight mode.  
5.9.2.2  In a level 2 or 3 area, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment can receive a mode 
profile giving an On Sight area which the train has already entered with its max safe 
front end. In this case, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall immediately switch 
to On Sight mode.  
5.9.2.3  The driver must acknowledge the On Sight mode. A request of acknowledgement shall 
be displayed to the driver.  
5.9.2.4  If the driver has not acknowledged after the driver acknowledgement time (refer to 
Appendix A .3.1), the service brake command shall be triggered. The brake command 
is released when the driver acknowledges, except if brakes are also applied for 
another reason(s).  
5.9.2.5  Note : Once in On Sight mode, the speed  supervision is such that the train speed 
cannot exceed the OS mode speed limit. If, when entering the On Sight mode, the 
train speed was higher than the OS mode  speed limit (because a higher speed was 
allowed in Full Supervision mode , in Limited Supervisi on mode  or in Staff Responsible 
mode) then a service/emergency brake command could be immediately triggered, 
independently of the acknowledgement of the driver, but because of the On Sight 
supervision (see Figure 4).

5.9.2.6  Note : This sharp brake reaction can be avoided in Full Supervision or Limited 
Supervision mode by giving with the previous MA an E OA (or a L OA = OS mode  speed  
limit) at the location of transition to On Sight mode. In Staff Responsible mode, lateral 
signals (if available) can also order the driver to decrease the train speed.  
5.9.2.7  If the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment is already in OS mode when receiving the 
OS mode profile,  no further acknowledgement shall be requested from the driver.  
5.9.3  On Sight is requested for a further location  
5.9.3.1  The beginning of the On Sight area can be a location that the train has not reached 
yet. This occurs when:  
a) In a level 1 area, a balise group gives a Mode Profile with an On Sight area that is 
located at a further location.  
b) In a level 2 or 3 area, the RBC gives a Mode Profile with an On Sight area that is 
located at a further location.  
5.9.3.2  A request for acknowledgement shall be displayed to the driver whe n the following 
conditions are fulfilled:  
a)  The distance between the estimated front end of the train and the beginning of On 
Sight area is shorter than a value, contained in the mode profile.   
b) The speed is lower than the On Sight mode speed limit (nationa l value, or value 
given in the mode profile).  
c) The current mode is not On Sight  
5.9.3.3  The conditions 5.9.3.2 a) and b)  define the “rectangle of acknowledgement”.  
5.9.3.4  Once the acknowledgement  request is displayed, it shall not be taken back if the train 
leaves the “re ctangle of acknowledgement” (for example: because the train 
accelerates).

 5.9.4  On Sight from Unfitted or S N mode  
5.9.4.1  The mode profile with regards to an OS area is only evaluated in levels 1,2 ,3, although 
the mode profile may have been received in level 0 (Unfitted mode) or NTC (SN 
mode). A transition to On Sight mode can therefore earliest occur at a transition of 
level: from level 0 or NTC to level 1 or 2 or 3.  
5.9.4.2  Requirements about the acknowle dgement in section 5.9.2 shall apply.  
5.9.5  On Sight from Stand By or Post Trip mode  
5.9.5.1  When performing a SoM or a Train Trip procedure and when the current level is 2 or 3, 
the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment can receive a mode profile giving an On Sight 
area which the train has already entered with its max safe front end. In this case, the 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall first require an acknowledgement from the 
driver.  
5.9.5.2  When the driver acknowledges, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall perform 
the transition to On Sight mode.”  
5.9.6  Exit of On Sight mode  
5.9.6.1  General rule  
5.9.6.1.1  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall exit the On Sight mode when the min 
safe front end of the train passes the end of the On Sight area.  
5.9.6.2  First case: The On Sight area ends at the EOA /LOA  of the curr ent MA  
5.9.6.2.1  This occurs when the end of the On Sight area that is given by the Mode Profile has 
the same location as the EOA /LOA  of the related MA.  
5.9.6.2.2  In this case, the train must receive a new Movement Authority to be able to exit the On 
Sight area.  
5.9.6.2.3  Note: In an O n Sight area there is no guarantee for the RBC that the track in front of 
the supervised train is free. Therefore, if the next block section is free, the RBC has 
nevertheless to ensure that there is no train/vehicle between the train and the end of 
the On Sight area. This information  
 can be given  to the RBC by the signalman or any other trackside means  (outside 
scope of  ERTMS/ ETCS ), or 
 can be inquired by the RBC by means of the following mechanism: the RBC sends 
a “track ahead free” request which the ERTM S/ ETCS on -board equipment 
displays to the driver. If the driver confirms that the track is free up to the end of the 
current section, the ERTMS/ ETCS on -board equipment will transmit this 
information to the RBC.

chapter 4, transitions between modes).  
5.9.6.3  Second case: The On Sight area ends before the EOA /LOA  of the current MA  
5.9.6.3.1  In this case, th e current Movement Authority already allows the train to exit the On 
Sight area.  
5.9.6.3.2  When exiting the On Sight area, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment switches

 5.10 Level Transitions  
5.10.1  General requirements  
5.10.1.1  Every level transition border to an area where operation in level 2, 3 or NTC is 
supported shall be announced to the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment via balise 
group or via the RBC.  
5.10.1.2  A level transition announcement to the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall 
consist of an order to execute the level transition at a further location corresponding to 
the border.  
5.10.1.3  When the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment receives a level transition 
announcement, and if this announcement will result in a change of the on -board level, 
it shall immediately inform the driver about the announced level transition.  
5.10.1.3.1  Note: In a mixed level area the actual level of the on -board equipment may remain 
unchanged even though a level transition boundary is passed.  
5.10.1.4  At the level transition border a balise group shall be placed with an immediate level 
transition order or a conditional level tran sition order . 
5.10.1.4.1  Note : Balise groups are read in all levels and level transition orders and conditional 
level transition orders from balises are accepted independent of the level of operation. 
Also sleeping units read balise groups.

5.10.1.5  If the message from the border balise group is not received, the level transition shall 
still be executed when the estimated front end passes the location given in the 
announcem ent. 
5.10.1.6  The on -board equipment shall manage only one level transition order at a time. 
Therefore a new level transition order shall replace a previously received order, i.e. if a 
new order to switch to a different level or to the same level but at a different  location is 
received, before the action from the first order has been performed, only the last order 
shall be executed.

 5.10.1.6.1  In Shunting and Passive Shunting modes only one set of Level Transition Information 
shall be stored at a time. Therefore a set of Level  Transition Information received shall 
replace any Level Transition Information already stored on -board.  
5.10.1.7  As soon as the announcement of the level transition has been received, some data 
(mainly movement authority and track description data) from the transm ission media of 
the new level shall be accepted, but shall not be used until the level transition is 
effective.  
5.10.1.7.1  Note: for the exhaustive list of accepted/rejected information, please refer to SRS 
chapter 4.8.  
5.10.1.7.2  Note: if only track description has been receiv ed from the new media without any 
movement authority, this track description still replaces the one previously received 
from the current media when the transition is performed.  
5.10.1.8  When the onboard has performed the level transition, further data (mainly movem ent 
authority and track description data) received from the transmission media of the level

possible.  
5.10.2.2  The level transition announcement and the immediate or conditional level transition 
order at the border shall contain all the sup ported ERTMS/ETCS levels with a table of 
priority.  Even if only one level is permitted this is considered as a table of priority.  
5.10.2.2.1  Note: Level 0 is considered in the same way as the other levels. This means that, for 
example, when an area permits ERTMS/ETCS  level 0, and is fitted with ERTMS/ETCS 
level 1 and 2, the track -side includes levels 0, 1 and 2 in a table of priority of supported 
levels in all level transition order s and conditional level transition orders  applying to that 
area. 
5.10.2.3  The table of priority shall list all the supported levels from the highest priority level to 
the lowest one.  
5.10.2.3.1  Intentionally deleted.  
5.10.2.4  When receiving the information about all ERTMS/ETCS levels that are supported by 
trackside , the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall select from the table the level 
with the highest priority , which is available for use by  the onboard equipment .

 5.10.2.4.1  The on -board equipment shall consider an ERTMS/ETCS level as “Available for use” 
as follows:  
a) Level 2 or 3: the level is configured on -board and at least one M obile Terminal is 
available on -board , i.e. the ETCS onboard has detected at least one Mobile 
Terminal in working condition, independently whether it is registered to a network or 
not. 
b) Level NTC: the concerned National System  is available on -board ( if an ST M is 
used, refer to SUBSET -035 for further details ). 
c) Level 0 or 1: always.  
5.10.2.4.1.1  Note regarding a) and b): how the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment checks the 
availability of the Mobile Terminals or of the National System (in case no STM is used) 
is an implementati on issue.  
5.10.2.4.2  Examples : The table of trackside supported levels gives 2,  NTC X, 1, NTC Y. If level 1 , 
0 and NTC X are “Available for use”, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board will select NTC X 
level. If level 1 , 0 and NTC Y are “Available for use”, it will select level 1.  If level 2 , 1 
and 0 are  “Available for use”, it will select level 2.  
5.10.2.5  When the onboard has selected the level it will switch to, it shall carry out the level 
transition as if it has received a level transition order to this level only i.e. it shall ignore 
the requirements related to transitions to the other levels.  
5.10.2.6  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall inform the driver about the selected level 
transition  only. 
5.10.2.7  If none of the ordered level(s) is available for use by the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 
equipment , it shall nevertheless make the transition, to the ordered level with the 
lowest priority.  
5.10.2.7.1  Justification:  The On -board equipment will then indicate the trackside level to the 
driver to allow him to select the correct procedures for degraded situations.

5.10.3.14  Conditional level transition order  
5.10.3.14.1  When the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment accepts a conditional level transition 
order the onboard shall check whether the current level i s contained in the priority list 
of the conditional level transition order.  
5.10.3.14.2  If the current level is contained in the priority list of the conditional level transition order, 
the onboard shall not change the level.  
5.10.3.14.3  If the current level is not contained in t he priority list of the conditional level transition 
order, the onboard shall evaluate the conditional level transition order in the same way 
as an immediate level transition order  (see section 5.10.2) . 
5.10.3.14.4  In the same way as for a level transition order, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment 
shall store the table of ERTMS/ETCS levels supported by trackside.  
5.10.3.14.5  Note: The conditional level transition order allows to check, whether a train operates in 
a permitted level e.g. following a start of mission after a cold move ment. The level of a 
train driving in a permitted level will not be changed, regardless of the priority of the 
current level operated by the train.  
5.10.3.15  Transition initiated by driver  
5.10.3.15.1  In addition to the level transitions ordered by trackside, it is also possib le, at standstill, 
for the driver to change the ERTMS/ETCS level (refer to section 3.18.4.2).  
5.10.3.15.2  If the driver changes the level to 2 or 3, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall 
establish a communication session with the RBC:  
a) immediately if at least one Mob ile Terminal is registered to a Radio Network and  a 
valid RBC ID/ phone number is available, OR  
b) once the driver has selected the R adio data (by the same means  as for Start of 
Mission) , if either no Mobile Terminal is registered to a Radio Network or  no val id 
RBC ID/phone number is available.  
5.10.3.15.2.1  Note regarding b): If the level transition leads to TR mode, the request for RBC 
contact information is only displayed once the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment is in 
PT mode.  
5.10.3.15.3  If the driver changes the level from 2 or 3 to  any other, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 
equipment shall report the new level to the RBC if a communication session is 
established. When receiving the level change report, the RBC shall order the 
communication session to be terminated.

5.10.4.1  If defined so for the level transition (see table below), the driver shall be requested to 
acknowledge the transition  
a) when the max  safe front end of the train has passed a trackside defined location in 
rear of the level transition border  
b) upon receipt of the order to switch to the new level immediately

 5.12 Change of Train Orientation  
5.12.1  Introduction  
5.12.1.1  The scope of this procedure is the supervision of a train where the driver controls the 
train from the cab in the front of the train with the direction controller in FORWARD 
position.  
5.12.1.2  This implies that when the driver has to change the orienta tion of the train, he has to 
change the driving cab.  
5.12.1.3  The scope of this procedure is NOT shunting movements, during which the driver 
change s the running direction of the train without leaving the cab, by changing the 
position of the direction controller fro m FORWARD to REVERSE.  
5.12.1.4  The scope of this procedure is NOT the backwards movement that is allowed in Post 
Trip or in Reversing mode.  
5.12.2  The driver uses the same engine  (a mission is ongoing)  
5.12.2.1  The situation is the following : The driver closes the desk A and leave s the cab A of the 
leading engine of the train, to go to cab B and open desk B of this same engine.  
5.12.2.2  Desk A and desk B are connected to the same ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment.  
5.12.2.3  When the driver closes the desk A, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment 
immediately goes to Stand -By mode, which  is considered as an end of mission (see 
“End of Mission” procedure) . 
5.12.2.4  When the driver opens the desk B, the “Start of Mission” procedure is triggered.  
5.12.2.5  When the driver closes a desk and opens the other one of the same engine, the  
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall be able to calculate the new train position 
data (train front position, train orientation), by use of the previous data.  
5.12.3  The driver leaves the engine to go to another one  
5.12.3.1  The described situation is the following : The tr ain has two engines (engine A and 
engine B). The engine A is the leading engine. The engine B is a slave engine. Each 
engine has its own ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment.  
a) If engine B is remote controlled, its ETCS on -board equipment is in Sleeping mode.  
Note : The mode is entered when on -board equipment detects the presence of the 
"remote control" signal.

 b) If the slave engine is not remote controlled (Tandem operation) by the leading 
engine but there is a driver who controls the engine, then the on -board equipm ent is 
in Non leading mode.  
c) If the engine B is not remote controlled (Tandem Shunting operation) by the leading 
engine and there is no driver who controls the engine, then the on -board equipment 
is in Passive Shunting mode.  
5.12.3.2  Assumption: The train configurat ion does not change.  
a) When changing the train orientation, the leading engine A will become the slave 
engine, and the slave engine B will become the leading engine.  
b) If before the change of train orientation engine B was in SL, afterwards engine A will 
be in  SL mode; If before the change of train orientation engine B was in NL, 
afterwards engine A will be in NL mode ; If before the change of train orientation 
engine B was in PS, afterwards engine A will be in PS mode . 
5.12.3.3  Case "Engine B was in SL mode"  
5.12.3.3.1  The driver of engine A closes the desk, then the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment of 
engine A switches to Stand -By mode. If the train has a mission, this is a end of mission 
(see “End of Mission” procedure)  
5.12.3.3.2  As soon as the remote control signal disappears, the ERTMS/ETCS  on-board 
equipment of engine B switches to Stand -By mode.  
5.12.3.3.3  Level 2,3: The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment of engine B open s a communication 
session (if possible) and report s the mode change to the RBC.  
5.12.3.3.4  When the driver opens a desk of engine B he triggers the  "Start of Mission" procedure.  
5.12.3.4  Case "Engine B was in NL mode"  
5.12.3.4.1  The driver of engine A selects "Non Leading". The ERTMS/ETCS equipment switches 
to Non Leading mode.  
5.12.3.4.2  Once the non leading input signal is not received any more , the ERTMS/ETCS on -
board equipment  of engine B will switch to Stand -By mode ( refer to SRS chapter 4, 
transitions between modes and chapter 5, “End of Mission” procedure).  
5.12.3.4.3  Because the desk is open, when the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment enters Stand -
By mode, the “Start of Mission” procedure  is triggered.  
5.12.3.5  Case "Engine B was in PS mode"  
5.12.3.5.1  The driver of engine A selects "Continue Shunting on desk closure". The 
ERTMS/ETCS equipment switches to Passive Shunting mode once the driver closes 
the desk of engine A.

5.12.4  The driver uses the same engine (a Shunting movement is ongoing)  
5.12.4.1  The situation is the following : while the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment is in 
Shunting mode, the driver closes the desk A and leaves the cab  A of the Shunting 
engine, to go to cab B and open desk B of this same engine.  
5.12.4.2  Desk A and desk B are connected to the same ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment.  
5.12.4.2.1  Before closing the desk A, the driver enables the function “Continue Shunting on desk 
closure”. When t he driver closes the desk A, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment 
shall immediately go to Passive Shunting mode.  
5.12.4.2.2  When the driver opens the desk B, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall 
immediately switch back to Shunting mode.  
5.12.4.3  When the driver closes a desk and opens the other one of the same engine, the

 5.13 Train Reversing  
5.13.1.1  This procedure is intended to allo w the fast reversal of movement of a train, to run 
away from a danger up to a “safe” location.  
5.13.1.2  The area where initiation of reversing will be possible is announced to the 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment  by trackside (refer to 3.15.4.2 for details).   
5.13.1.3  While th e train is at standstill inside the reversing permitted area, the driver shall be 
informed that reversing is possible  
5.13.1.4  If the ERTMS/ETCS onboard detects the driver’s intention to reverse (e.g. from a 
direction controller in reverse position) , the ERTMS/ETCS  on-board equipment shall 
ask the driver to acknowledge transition to RV mode.  
5.13.1.5  If the driver acknowledges , the on -board equipment shall switch to RV mode  
5.13.1.6  Once in RV mode,  it shall be possible for the trackside to send a new permitted 
distance to run  and a new maximum speed . 
5.13.1.7  Once in RV mode, it shall also be possible for the trackside to send, together with the 
new permitted distance to run and the maximum speed, a new reference location for 
the new permitted distance to run.  
5.13.1.8  Note: this new reference locatio n is the end of a new reversing area given by trackside 
that the onboard will use only for the purpose of distance referencing.

 5.14 Joining / Splitting  
5.14.1  Definitions  
5.14.1.1  Definition for splitting: The “train to be split” is the train at standstill, waiting for bein g 
split. The “front train after splitting” refers to the front part of the train before splitting, 
the “new train after splitting”, refers to the other part.  
5.14.1.2  Definitions for joining: The “train to be joined” is the train at standstill, waiting for being 
joined. The “joining train” is the train performing the joining operation.  
5.14.2  Procedure “Splitting”  
5.14.2.1  Step 1 - The electrical and mechanical links between the two trains must be removed 
(this is a national operational procedure, out of the scope of the SRS).  
5.14.2.1.1  Note : If splitting require s moving the two train parts apart from each other for a small 
distance, this can be done even in SB mode  
5.14.2.2  Step 2a - If the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment which was supervising the train 
before splitting has not performed an end of missi on for splitting, the driver must 
modify the Train Data such that it fits with the new train composition after splitting.  
For level 2 or 3, the new train data is sent to the RBC (see SRS chapter 3 – Data Entry 
/ Modification Process)  
5.14.2.3  Step 2b - If an ERTMS /ETCS on -board equipment of the "new train after splitting" was 
in SL mode before, it will switch to SB mode once the remote control signal is not 
received any more (refer to SRS chapter 4, transitions between modes).  
For Level 2 or 3: The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment open s a communication 
session (if possible) and report s the mode change to the RBC.  
5.14.2.4  Step 2c - If an ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment of the "new train after splitting" was 
in NL mode before, it will switch to SB mode once the non leading input signal is not 
received any more (refer to SRS chapter 4, transitions between modes and chapter 5, 
“end of mission” procedure).  
5.14.2.5  The driver can then start a new mission with this “new train after splitting” (refer to the 
“Start of Mission” procedure). In al l cases, to start a mission is not the only possibility. 
Shunting movements, or not moving the new train at all, are also possible.  
 
5.14.3  Procedure “Joining”  
5.14.3.1  Step 1 - The “joining train” must approach the “train to be joined”. This can be 
performed in SR, OS or  SH mode (depending on the information available, and on the 
national procedure for joining).

 5.14.3.2  Step 2 - The electrical and mechanical links between the two trains must be closed 
(vehicle dependent, outside the scope of the ETCS).  
5.14.3.3  Step 3a - If a former leadi ng ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment remains leading and 
there was no end of mission, the driver must modify the Train Data such that it fits with 
the new train composition. For level 2 or 3, the new train data is sent to the RBC (see 
SRS chapter 3 – Data Entr y / Modification Process)  
5.14.3.4  Step 3b - If a former leading ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment is to become slave 
equipment in SL mode, when closing the desk, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment 
will switch to SB mode (see SRS chapter 4, transitions between modes) an d the end of 
mission procedure is executed (see “End of Mission” procedure). Transition to SL 
mode is from SB mode.  
5.14.3.5  Step 3c  - If a former leading ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment is to become slave 
equipment in NL mode, the driver selects NL mode (see SRS cha pter 4, transitions 
between modes).  
5.14.3.6  For further steps after joining refer to procedures “Start of Mission” and “Change of 
Train Orientation”.

 5.15 RBC/RBC Handover  
5.15.1  Principles  
5.15.1.1  Every RBC/RBC handover shall be announced to the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 
equipment via a  balise group or via the RBC.  
5.15.1.2  The handover announcement (i.e. RBC transition order) to the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 
equipment shall consist of an order to contact the Accepting RBC (see 3.5.3.5.3) and 
to execute the handover at a further location corresponding to the border.  
5.15.1.2.1  In case of RBC/RBC handover including Radio Network change , ERTMS/ETCS 
trackside is responsible for the sequence of orders to register to the new Radio 
Network and to contact the "Accepting" RBC, according to the Radio Network ’s 
configuratio n. 
5.15.1.2.2  In the following sections, "first" Mobile Terminal refers to the one used for 
communication session with “Handing Over” RBC and "second" Mobile Terminal to the 
one used for communication session with “Accepting” RBC.  
5.15.1.2.3  Note : In the following sections, Rad io Networks are supposed to be overlapped.  
5.15.1.3  At the RBC/RBC border a balise group with an order to execute the handover 
immediately shall be placed.  
5.15.1.3.1  Note : Balise groups are read in all levels and orders from balise groups are accepted 
independent of the leve l of operation. Also sleeping units read balise groups.  
5.15.1.4  If the message from the border balise group is not (yet) received, the handover shall 
still be executed when the train with its max safe front end passes the border location 
according to the announcem ent information.  
5.15.1.5  The on -board equipment shall manage only one RBC/RBC transition at a time, 
therefore a new transition order shall replace a previously received order.  
5.15.2  Procedure  
5.15.2.1  Overview  
5.15.2.1.1  In the normal operation, the main functional steps needed for running  from one RBC 
area to another one are the following:  
a) Pre-announcement of the transition by the “Handing Over” RBC;  
b) Registration to the new Radio Network of second Mobile Terminal (optional) & 
Establishment of the radio communication session with the “Accep ting” RBC;  
c) Generation of movement authorities including the border;

5.15.2.2  Step by step description  
5.15.2.2.1  Pre-announcement  
5.15.2.2.1.1  When the “Handing Over” RBC generates a movement authority which reaches the 
border to another RBC area, it initiates the processes associated to the transition.  
5.15.2.2.1.2  The “Handing Over” RBC informs the “Accepting” RBC about the RBC/RBC 
handover.  
5.15.2.2.2  Registration to the new Radio Network of second Mobile Terminal (optional) & 
Establishment of the radio communication session with “Accepting” RBC  
5.15.2.2.2.1  A radio communication session with the Accepting RBC  is opened by the on -board 
equipment based on the RBC transition order received from the “Handing Over” RBC 
or from balise group (refer to chapter 3, section "management of radio 
communication").  
5.15.2.2.2.2  In case of RBC/RBC handover including Radio Network change , the registration to 
the new radio network of the second Mobile Terminal is completed before the RBC 
transition order is transmitted to the on -board equipment.  
5.15.2.2.3  Generation of MAs including the border  
5.15.2.2.3.1  The “Handing Over” RBC is responsible for establishing the  movement authority 
based on:  
a) Information from the trackside equipment and interlocking of its own area (for the 
part of route related information up to the border),  
b) Information from the “Accepting RBC” for the part of route related information in 
advance of the border.

the “Accepting” RBC.  
5.15.2.2.4.2  The “Handing Over” RBC forwards the announcement information to the 
“Accepting” RBC.  
5.15.2.2.4.2.1  Note:  The forwarding of the announcement information  is executed because the 
“Handing Over” RBC has no knowledge if the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment is in 
a degraded situation or not i.e. whether it can handle one or two communication 
sessions.  
5.15.2.2.5  Transfer of train supervision to “Accepting” RBC  
5.15.2.2.5.1  As soon as the on -board has sent to the “Accepting” RBC the position report, it 
considers to be supervised by the “Accepting” RBC i.e. it uses in formation received 
from the “Accepting” RBC.  
5.15.2.2.5.2  When the “Accepting” RBC receives a position report from the on -board and detects 
that the max safe front end has passed the border, it takes over the responsibility and 
informs the “Handing Over” RBC.

 5.19 Procedure Limited Supervision  
5.19.1  General Requirements  
5.19.1.1  The order to switch to Limited Supervision mode shall be given by means of a mode 
profile.  
5.19.1.2  An acknowledgement for running in Limited Supervision mode shall be r equested from 
the driver. The conditions of the acknowledgement are specified below.  
5.19.2  Limited Supervision is requested for current location  (from modes 
different from Stand By and Post Trip)  
5.19.2.1  In a level 1 area, the beginning of the Limited Supervision area c an be the balise 
(group) that gives the Mode Profile. When the train passes the balise group and 
receives this information, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall immediately 
switch to Limited Supervision mode.  
5.19.2.2  In a level 2 or 3 area, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment can receive a mode 
profile giving a Limited Supervision area which the train has already entered with its 
max safe front end. In this case, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall 
immediately switch to Limited Supervision mode.  
5.19.2.3  The driver mus t acknowledge the Limited Supervision mode. A request of 
acknowledgement shall be displayed to the driver.  
5.19.2.4  If the driver has not acknowledged after the driver acknowledgement time (refer to 
Appendix A .3.1), the service brake command  shall be triggered. The  brake command 
is released when the driver acknowledges, except if brakes are also applied for 
another reason(s).  
5.19.2.5  Note : Once in Limited Supervision mode, the speed supervision is such that the train 
speed cannot exceed the LS mode speed limit. If, when ent ering the Limited 
Supervision mode, the train speed was higher than the LS mode speed limit (because 
a higher speed was allowed in Full Supervision mode, On Sight mode or in Staff 
Responsible mode) then an emergency brake  command  could be immediately 
triggered, independently of the acknowledgement of the driver, but because of the LS 
supervision (see Figure 22).

5.19.2.6  Note : This sharp  brake reaction can be avoided in Full Supervision or On Sight mode 
by giving with the previous MA an E OA (or a L OA = LS mode speed limit) at the 
location of transition to Limited Supervision mode.  
5.19.2.7  If the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment is already in LS mode  when receiving the LS 
mode profile, no further acknowledgement shall be requested from the driver.  
5.19.3  Limited Supervision is requested for a further location  
5.19.3.1  The beginning of the Limited Supervision area can be a location that the train has not 
reached yet. This occurs when:  
a) In a level 1 area, a balise group gives a Mode Profile with an Limited Supervision 
area that is located at a further location.  
b) In a level 2 or 3 area, the RBC gives a Mode Profile with an Limited Supervision 
area that is located at a furt her location.  
5.19.3.2  A request for acknowledgement shall be displayed to the driver when the following 
conditions are fulfilled:  
a)  The distance between the estimated front end of the train and the beginning of 
Limited Supervision area is shorter than a value, cont ained in the mode profile.   
b) The speed is lower than the Limited Supervision mode speed limit (national value, 
or value given in the mode profile).  
c) The current mode is not Limited Supervision  
5.19.3.3  Note : The first 2 conditions define the “rectangle of acknowledg ement”.  
5.19.3.4  Once the acknowledgement request is displayed, it shall not be taken back if the train 
leaves the “rectangle of acknowledgement” (for example: because the train 
accelerates).

 5.19.4  Limited Supervision from Unfitted or S N mode  
5.19.4.1  The mode profile with regards to an LS area is only evaluated in levels 1,2,3, although 
the mode profile may have been received in level 0 (Unfitted mode) or NTC (SN 
mode). A transition to Limited Supervision mode can therefore earliest occur at a 
transition of level: from level 0 or NTC to level 1 or 2 or 3.  
5.19.4.2  Requirements about the acknowledgement in section 5.19.2 shall apply.  
5.19.5  Limited Supervision from Stand By or Post Tr ip mode  
5.19.5.1  When performing a SoM or a Train Trip procedure and when the current level is 2 or 3, 
the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment can receive a mode profile giving an Limited 
Supervision area which the train has already entered with its max safe front end. I n this 
case, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall first require an acknowledgement 
from the driver.  
5.19.5.2  When the driver acknowledges, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall perform 
the transition to Limited Supervision mode.  
5.19.6  Exit of Limited Supervision mod e 
5.19.6.1  General rule  
5.19.6.1.1  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall exit the Limited Supervision mode when 
the min safe front end of the train passes the end of the Limited supervision area.  
5.19.6.2  First case: The Limited supervision  area ends at the EOA /LOA  of the current MA  
5.19.6.2.1  This occurs when the end of the Limited Supervision area that is given by the Mode 
Profile has the same location as the EOA /LOA  of the related MA.  
5.19.6.2.2  In this case, the train must receive a new Movement Authority to be able to exit the 
Limited Supervision are a. 
5.19.6.3  Second case: The Limited Supervision  area ends before the EOA /LOA  of the 
current MA  
5.19.6.3.1  In this case, the current Movement Authority already allows the train to exit the Limited 
Supervision area.  
5.19.6.3.2  When exiting the Limited Supervision area, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment 
switches either to Full Supervision, On Sight or to Shunting mode (refer to SRS 
chapter 4, transitions between modes).

 5.20.7  Changing the allowed current consumption  
5.20.7.1  This procedure is dealing with the generation of the inform ation related to a change of 
allowed current consumption.  
5.20.7.2  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall start the generation of the information to 
the ERTMS/ETCS external function when the max safe front end of the train reaches a 
location (point C) in rear of t he location of change of allowed current consumption  
(point F).  
5.20.7.3  This location (point C) shall be determined by the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment 
taking into account the time necessary for performing the required actions and the 
current train speed.  
5.20.7.4  When th e min safe rear end of the train is in rear of the location of change of allowed 
current consumption (point F), the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall provide 
the following information to the ERTMS/ETCS external function:  
 the remaining distance from the m ax safe front end of the train to the location of 
allowed current consumption (point F)  
 the new allowed current consumption  
5.20.7.5  When the min safe rear end of the train reaches the location of change of allowed 
current consumption (point F), the remaining dist ance from the max safe front end of 
the train to point F and the new allowed current consumption shall no longer be 
generated.  
5.20.7.6  Note: The remaining distance from the train max safe front end to point F is generated 
until the min safe rear end passes the poi nt F to allow the ERTMS/ETCS external 
function, in case the change of allowed current consumption involves several 
pantographs, to manage each pantograph individually assuming that this function 
knows the distance between each pantograph and the train fron t end.

5.20.7.7  If any reason (e.g. see Appendix A.3.4) leads to the deletio n of the change of allowed 
current consumption, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall stop providing 
information related to this change of allowed current consumption to the ERTMS/ETCS 
external function.  
5.20.8  Station platform  
5.20.8.1  This procedure is dealing with th e generation of the information related to a station 
platform.  
5.20.8.2  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall start the generation of the information to 
the ERTMS/ETCS external function when the max safe front end of the train reaches a 
location (point C) in rear  of the start location of the station platform (point D).  
5.20.8.3  This location (point C) shall be determined by the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment 
taking into account the time necessary for performing the required actions and the 
current train speed.  
5.20.8.4  When the min safe rear end of the train is in rear of the start location (point D) of the 
station platform, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall provide the following 
information to the ERTMS/ETCS external function:  
 the remaining distance from the max safe front end  of the train to the start location 
(point D) of the station platform  
 the remaining distance from the min safe front end of the train to the end location 
(point E) of the station platform  
 the nominal height of platform above rail level (refer to TSI infras tructure)  
 the position of the station platform (left side, right side, both sides) in reference to 
the train orientation  
5.20.8.5  When the min safe rear end of the train reaches the start location (point D) of the 
station platform, the remaining distance from the m ax safe front end of the train to 
point D shall no longer be generated. The remaining distance from the min safe front 
end of the train to the end location (point E) of the station platform as well as its 
nominal height above the rail level and its positio n shall continue to be generated.  
5.20.8.6  When the min safe rear end of the train reaches the end location (point E) of the 
station platform , the remaining distance from the min safe front end of the train to point 
E, the position of the station platform and its n ominal heigh t above the rail level shall 
no longer be generated.  
5.20.8.7  Note: The remaining distance from the train max safe front end to point D and the 
remaining distance from the train min safe front end to point E are generated until the

 6.3 Scope 
6.3.1.1 The chapter defines the composition of  envelope of legally operated system versions, 
i.e. all the ERTMS/ETCS system versions that trackside shall be allowed to operate and that on-board equipment shall support. 
6.3.1.2 By default, all the clauses listed in the other SRS chapters are applicable regardless of 
the system version operated (see SUBSET-104 § 6.1.3.2); this chapter includes the exceptions to those clauses and the additional clauses, which apply when the system version of some trackside constituents and/or the system version operated relates to a version number older than the last one introduced.

 6.5 Trackside requirements in relation to older system versions 
6.5.1 Trackside areas operated with system version number X = 1 
6.5.1.1 Introduction 
6.5.1.1.1 The section is applicable for trackside infrastructures that will be tendered and still 
operated with the system version number X = 1, after the entry into force of this release of the SRS. 
6.5.1.1.2 Within a trackside infrastructure operated with the system version number X = 1, it shall 
be allowed to use the following values of M_VERSION: 1.0, and 1.1 
6.5.1.1.3 Within a trackside area operated with an RBC certified to the system version number X 
= 1, it shall also be allowed to use for balises the following values of M_VERSION: 2.0 and 2.1. 
6.5.1.1.3.1 Note: this configuration is meaningful in case the trains operating on this RBC area 
support the system version number X = 2 and the on-board requirements related to the trackside information marked with 2.0 or 2.1 are applicable regardless of the operated version (i.e. they are applied by the on-board equipment even if this latter operates with the system version number X = 1 ordered by RBC). 
6.5.1.2 Exceptions to chapter 3 
6.5.1.2.1 Intentionally deleted. 6.5.1.2.1.1 Section 3.6.2.4 shall not apply. 6.5.1.2.2 Clause 3.7.1.1 b) shall be replaced with: “When needed, limitations related to the 
movement authority, i.e. Mode profile for On Sight or Shunting and signalling related speed restriction (see sections 3.12.4 and 3.11.6). Mode profile and Signalling related Speed restriction shall always be sent together with the MA to which the information belongs” 
6.5.1.2.3 In clause 3.7.1.1 c), the bullet “Optionally Speed restriction to ensure a given permitted 
braking distance (see section 3.11. 11)” shall not apply. 
6.5.1.2.4 In clause 3.7.2.4, the bullet “LX speed restrictions” shall not apply. 6.5.1.2.5 In clause 3.7.2.4, the bullet “Inhibition of revocable TSRs from balises in L2/3 (from

6.6.1.1 This section covers the following situations: 
a) Train is running on a trackside infrastructure operated with system version number X 
= 1 
b) Train is running on a trackside infrastructure operated with system version number X 
= 2, but still transmitting some balise/loop/RIU information related to system version number X = 1 (see section 6.5.2) 
c) Train is running on a trackside infrastructure operated with system version number X 
= 2, but on-board equipment has established a communication session with a neighbouring RBC certified to system version number X = 1 
d) Train is running on a trackside infrastructure operated with system version number X 
= 1 or 2 and the on-board equipment has established a communication session with a RBC/RIU certified to system version number X.Y = 2.0 
6.6.2 Specific requirements for on-board  operating with system version number

 7.3 Components of ERTMS/ETCS Language  
7.3.1  Introduction  
7.3.1.1  The ERTMS/ETCS language is used in transmitting information over t he radio, balise 
and loop airgaps.  
7.3.1.2  The ERTMS/ETCS language is based on variables, packets, messages and telegrams 
(variables and packets are described in this section, while telegrams and messages 
are described in chapter 8).  
7.3.1.3  Note: A number of variables co ntain values which have to be assigned. Some of these 
values have to be unique to ensure that the system functions properly. A centralised 
handling of this assignment is therefore required (nationally or internationally, 
depending on the variable). The var iables concerned have been marked. The values 
included in this document for these variables are therefore not to be used without prior 
verification of their validity.  See SUBSET -054 for further details.  
7.3.2  Definition of Variables  
7.3.2.1  Variables are used to encode single data values. Variables cannot be split in minor 
units. The whole variable has one type (meaning).  
7.3.2.2  Variables may have special values which are related to the basic meaning of the 
variable.  
7.3.2.3  Special values have always the highest values in a variable ( e.g. 32767  = “unknown ”). 
7.3.2.4  Spare values are located between the normal and special values in the variable range  
7.3.2.5  Names of variables are unique. A variable is used in context with the meaning as 
described in the variable definition. Variables with different me anings have different 
names.

7.3.3  Definition of Packets  
7.3.3.1  Packets are multiple variables grouped into a sing le unit, with a defined internal 
structure.  
7.3.3.2  This structure consists of a packet header with:  
 Track to Train: a unique packet number, the length of the packet in bits, the 
orientation information, optionally the distance scale and an information section 
containing a defined set of variables. The packet structure is as follows:  
Number  NID_PACKET  Packet identifier  
Direction  Q_DIR  Specifies the validity  direction 
of transmitted data  
Length  L_PACKET   Number of bits in the packet  
Scale  Q_SCALE  Specifies which distance scale 
is used for all distance 
information within the packet.  
There is no Q_SCALE variable 
in packets which do not contain 
distance information.  
Information  ...... Well defined set(s) of variables.  
 Train to Track: a unique packet number, the len gth of the packet in bits, optionally 
the distance scale and an information section containing a defined set of variables. 
The packet structure is as follows:  
Number  NID_PACKET  Packet identifier  
Length  L_PACKET   Number of bits in the packet  
Scale  Q_SCALE  Specifies which distance scale 
is used for all distance 
information within the packet.

 There is no Q_SCALE variable 
in packets which do not contain 
distance information.  
Information  ...... Well defined set(s) of variables.  
7.3.3.3  The packet definition does not  change when transmitted over different transmission 
media.  
7.3.3.4  All currently not defined packet identifiers are reserved for future use  and shall be 
considered as invalid values (i.e. like spare values)  when received by the on -board 
equipment . Exception: rece ption of information only differing by Y with regards to the 
highest system version number X supported by on -board (refer to section 3.17.3.11) . 
7.3.3.5  Exception: Packet 0 “Virtual Balise Cover marker” and Packet 255: “End of Telegram” 
do not follow the above defined structure . 
7.3.3.6  N_ITER specifies the number of iterations of a variable or group of variables which 
follow.  
7.3.3.7  If N_ITER is 0 then no variables follow.  
7.3.3.8  Two nested levels of iterations can exist.  
7.3.3.9  If, depending on the value of a previous qualifier variable in t he packet, a variable is 
optional, it is written indented in the packet definition  
7.3.3.10  Row “Transmi tted by” in the description of a packet specifies which ERTMS/ETCS 
trackside device (b alise, loop, RIU, RBC) can  transmi t this packet.  “Any” means that 
the packe t can be transmitted by a b alise, a loop, an RBC and a RIU . 
7.3.3.10.1  Row “Transmitted to” in the description of a packet specifies to which ERTMS/ETCS 
trackside device the packet can be transmitted.

 8.3 Introduction  
8.3.1  Scop e and Purpose  
8.3.1.1  This chapter defines the format and content of messages necessary for ERTMS/ETCS 
functions.  
8.3.1.2  Concerning the transmission media, this chapter does not cover considerations such 
as medium -specific use constraints (e .g. distance between track -circuit and balise…), 
as well as functions (e .g. detection of balise reference, time and location stamp, 
identifying type of receiving balise, Key Management, Releasing/maintaining a radio 
connection…) and performance of the transmission media.  
8.3.2  Definitions  
8.3.2.1  Transmission media considered hereafter are standard ERTMS/ETCS transmission 
media used for ETCS  (Eurobalise, Euroradio and Euroloop).  
8.3.2.2  A message includes user data (application level) and protocol data (depending on the 
transmission medium).  
8.3.2.3  A Eurobalise mes sage is the information sent by a balise group (i.e. the message is 
composed of one or several telegrams , sorted by balise number in the group (telegram 
from balise number 1 first), ea ch telegram is transmitted by a Eurobalise). A 
Eurobalise telegram conta ins one header and an identified and coherent set of 
Packets.

 8.4 Rules  
8.4.1  Common Rules  
8.4.1.1  A message (Euroradio/Euroloop) or telegram (Eurobalise) is composed of  
1. One Header,  
2. When needed, a predefined set of variables (only for Radio),  
3. When needed, a predefined set of Packets (only for Radio),  
4. Optional Packets as needed by application.  
8.4.1.2  The transmission order shall respect the order of data elements listed in the message 
format (from top to bottom).  
8.4.1.3  The behaviour of the receiv er shall not depend on the sequence of the Packets given 
by the message.  
8.4.1.3.1  Exception for Infill information: The locations given in the packets following packet 136 
(Infill Location Reference) shall be referred to the balise group indicated in such 
packet.  
8.4.1.3.2  Note: orientations are in any case always referred to the directionality of balise group 
(balise transmission), directionality of loop (Euroloop transmission) or directionality of 
LRBG (radio transmission).  
8.4.1.4  A track -to-train message shall contain at most one  instance of the same packet type 
for the same direction.  
8.4.1.4.1  Exception 1: A message can contain several packets 44 (Data used by applications 
outside the ERTMS/ETCS system).  
8.4.1.4.2  Exception 2: A message can contain several packets 65 (Temporary Speed 
Restriction). In case of  revocable TSRs, the identities of the corresponding temporary 
speed restrictions (variable NID_TSR) transmitted in the same message shall be 
different.  
8.4.1.4.3  Exception 3: A message can contain several packets 66 (TSR Revocation). The 
identities of the  corresponding temporary speed restrictions (variable NID_TSR) 
transmitted in the same message shall be different.  
8.4.1.4.4  Exception 4: A message transmitted by a balise group can contain one packet 136 per 
balise telegram per direction. Each packet 136 indicates which part of that telegram is 
to be considered as part of the infill information. Multiple packets 136 in balises of a 
balise group shall  have identical content per direction.

Messages  Page 10/33 
 8.4.1.4.5  Exception 5: A message can contain several packets 88 (Level Crossing informati on). 
The identities of the corresponding Level Crossings (variable NID_LX) transmitted in 
the same message shall be different.  
8.4.1.4.6  Exception 6: A message transmitted by a balise group can contain several packets 254 
(default balise , loop or RIU  information).  
8.4.1.4.7  Exception 7: A message transmitted by a balise group can contain several packets 145 
(Inhibition of balise group message consistency reaction).  
8.4.1.4.8  Exception 8: A message transmitted by a balise group can contain several packets 0 
(Virtual Balise Cover marker).  
8.4.1.4.9  Exception 9: A message transmitted by a balise group can contain several packets 6 
(Virtual Balise Cover  order ). The identities (pairs of variables NID_VBCMK and NID_C) 
of the corresponding VBC transmitted in the same message shall be different.  
8.4.1.5  A train -to-track message shall contain at most one instance of the same packet type . 
8.4.1.5.1  Exception: A message can contain several packets 44 (Data used by applications 
outside the ERTMS/ETCS system).  
8.4.1.6  Note: For the purposes of clause 8.4.1.4, when the same packet is tra nsmitted by 
duplicated balises, this is considered to be only a single instance of the packet within 
the message. Justification: The on -board equipment will only use one of these 
duplicated telegrams (and therefore only one set of duplicated packets) to co mpose 
the balise group message (see 3.16.2.4.8.2).

 9.3 Introduction  
9.3.1  Scope and Purpose  
9.3.1.1  Chapter 9 lists a classification into categories of all the clauses in the chapters 1 to 8 of 
the SRS.  
9.3.1.2  The purpose of this chapter is to ease the assess ment  of the compliance of an 
ERTMS/ ETCS on -board equipment with the SRS. 
9.3.1.3  To that effect , this chapter comprehensively identifies  which clauses contain  
requirements allocated to the ERTMS/ ETCS on -board equipment and conversely 
which ones do not, either because they contain  requirements allocated to the 
ERTMS/ ETCS trackside on ly or because they are of another type . 
9.3.2  Definitions  
9.3.2.1  The following categories are used to classify each SRS clause : 
a) ERTMS/ ETCS on -board requirement : a c lause containing requirement(s) that 
must be fulfilled by a SRS compliant ERTMS/ ETCS on -board  
b) ERTMS/ ETCS trackside  requirement : a c lause containing requirement(s) that 
must be fulfilled by a SRS compliant ERTMS/ ETCS trackside , in case the 
corresponding function is implemented  
c) Definition : a clause that is a necessary prerequisite to the correct interpretation of 
requirement(s) or without which requirement(s) cannot be unambiguously 
interpreted  
d) Informative : a clause that helps the reader to better understand the context or the 
justification of requirement(s)  
e) Others : a clause that does not belong to any of the ab ove categories  
9.3.2.2  Throughout the SRS, the requirements are identified as sentences using the keyword 
“shall”. However:  
a) In section 9.4, table s are identified as a single entity through a reference based on 
the accompanying clause number. They can be classified  as ERTMS/ETCS on -
board and/or trackside requirements even if they do not include the keyword “shall”.  
b) Elements of the ERTMS/ETCS language (radio messages, packets and variables, 
see chapters 7 and 8) are also described with table s. The numbered titles (i. e. the 
name of the element preceded by a clause number) together with their associated 
table  are considered as single entities and are classified as both ERTMS/ETCS on -
board and trackside requirements, even if they do not include the keyword “shall” 
either . 
9.3.2.3  Amongst the categories listed in 9.3.2.1 only the two first ones can be combined , in 
case a requirement equally applies to both ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment and 
ERTMS/ETCS trackside  or in case two unambiguously distinguishable on -board and 
trackside req uirements are kept together in the concerned clause for readability 
reasons.
