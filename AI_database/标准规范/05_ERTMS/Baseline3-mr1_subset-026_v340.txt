Introduction  Page 5/8 
 1.3 Introduction  
1.3.1.1  Train control is an important part of any railway operations management system. In the 
past a number of different Automatic Train Control (ATC) systems ha ve evolved in 
different countries at different times. These systems are incompatible and not 
interoperable with each other. Only a few of these systems are used in more than one 
country, and even in those cases there have been differences in detailed devel opment 
which have resulted in incompatible and not interoperable versions.  
1.3.1.2  Many railways anticipate a significant increase in density of train traffic and are 
rethinking their i nfrastructure strategy, to accommodate high levels of traffic, in which 
ATC sys tems play an important part. Also many railways would like to introduce 
standardised systems to reduce system costs. In order to establish international 
standardisation of ATC systems, the following document specifies the European Rail 
Traffic Management S ystem/European Train Control System (ERTMS/ETCS).  
1.4 Advantages of an International Interoperable System  
1.4.1.1  The advantages expected by the railways can be summarised as:  
 Cross border interoperability.  
 Improvement of the safety of national and international train  traffic.  
 Improvement of international passengers and freight train traffic management.  
 Shorter headway on heavily trafficked lines, by driving on moving block, enabling 
exploitation of maximum track capacity.  
 The possibility of step -by-step introduction of the new technology.  
 Enabling Pan -European competition between the manufacturers of ERTMS/ETCS 
components. Strengthe ning the position of the European railway industry on the 
world market.  
 Enabling preconditions for future harmonisation in other areas of rail traffic 
management.  
1.5 About this Document  
1.5.1.1  The purpose of this document is to specify the unified European Train Control System 
(ETCS ) from a technical point of view.  
1.5.1.2  Some parts of the system are only specified to allow a migration from existing train 
control systems to ETCS (e.g. STM’s) over a transition period. They might be removed 
in a future edition of the standard.  
1.5.1.3  To reach technical interoperability it is necessary not only that telegrams are generated 
and understood according to well specified rul es but also that a train respectively

 trackside equipment reacts in a uniform way to information received. Technical 
interoperability requires specifications of a detailed level.  
1.5.1.4  For operational interoperability it is necessary to add operating rules, eng ineering 
standards etc. to the system design. Reaching operational interoperability is outside 
the scope of the SRS.  
1.6 How to Read and Use the SRS  
1.6.1.1  The SRS covers 8 chapters, which are briefly described in the section following this 
introduction.  
1.6.1.2  All reader s may need to refer to the Glossary  of terms and abbreviations (SUBSET -
023). 
1.7 Mandatory and Optional Requirements  
1.7.1.1  This specification often offers multiple solutions on how to implement a specific 
function. It therefore contains both mandatory and optional requirements. Mandatory 
requirements are always referred to using the word “shall” where else optional 
requirements are referred to using the word “may”.  
1.7.1.2  The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall implement all mandatory requirements, 
with the only exception s and conditions explicitly stated in the Control -Command and 
Signalling TSI and in this SRS . 
1.7.1.3  For ERTMS/ETCS trackside the implementation of functions has to be defined 
according to the characteristics of the specific lines and the related operational need s. 
In any case, the requirements of this SRS related to the implemented functions shall 
be respected . 
1.7.1.4  Notes are added to the specification in some parts for clarification. They however 
never contain requirements.  
1.7.1.5  Not specified requirements and solutions ar e only permitted as long as they do not 
generate any interoperability problems.   
 
1.8 Contents of the SRS  
1.8.1.1  The SRS defines the system requirements for the European Train Control System 
(ETCS) of ERTMS..  
1.8.1.2  This sub -section is intended to give a rough overview of  the contents of each chapter 
within the SRS so that readers interested only in specialised subjects can easily find 
the relevant chapters.

1.8.5  Chapter 4:  Modes and Transitions  
1.8.5.1.1  Chapter 4 defines the modes of the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment and all 
transitions between modes.  
1.8.6  Chapter 5:  Procedures  
1.8.6.1  Chapter 5 defines the dynamic behaviour of procedures that are necessary for 
interoperability. Proced ures are presented by a state transition chart and a 
corresponding table, where all elements (States, events, transitions) of the chart are 
defined. The description of the procedures shows all states of the ERTMS/ETCS 
onboard unit and the conditions that m ust be fulfilled to switch from one state to 
another.  
1.8.7  Chapter 6:  Management of older System Versions  
1.8.7.1.1  Chapter 6 defines the envelope of legally operated system versions and list s the 
exceptions that shall apply by derogation to the requirements listed in th e other 
chapters of the SRS, when an older ERTMS/ETCS system version is used  by the 
trackside subsystem . 
1.8.8  Chapter 7:  ERTMS/ETCS Language  
1.8.8.1  Chapter 7 defines and describes the necessary variables to be used for the data flow 
over the air gap between track and train. The grouping of these into packets is 
described. The format of messages is given in Chapter 8.

 2.4 System structure  
2.4.1.1  Due to the nature of the required functions, the ERTMS/ETCS system  will have to be 
partly on the trackside and partly on board the trains.  
2.4.1.2  This defines two sub -systems, the on -board sub -system and the trackside sub -system.  
2.4.1.3  The environment of ERTMS/ETCS system is composed of:  
a) the train, which will then be considered in the tr ain interface specification;  
b) the driver, which will then be considered via the driver interface specification;  
c) other onboard interfaces (see architecture drawing in 2.5.3),  
d) external trackside systems (interlockings, control centres, etc.), for which no 
interoperability requirement will be established.

 2.5 Sub-systems  
2.5.1  Trackside subsystem  
2.5.1.1  Depending of the application level (see further sections), the trackside sub -system can 
be composed of:  
a) balise  
b) lineside electronic unit  
c) the radio communication network (GSM -R) 
d) the Radio Block Centre (RBC)  
e) Euroloop  
f) Radio infill unit  
g) Key Management Centre (KMC)  
2.5.1.2  Balise  
2.5.1.2.1  The balise is a transmission device that can send telegrams to the on -board sub -
system.  
2.5.1.2.2  The balise is based on the existing Eurobalise specifications. These document s are 
included in the frame of the ERTMS/ETCS specifications.  
2.5.1.2.3  The balises provides the up -link, i. e. the possibility to send messages from trackside 
to the on -board sub -system.  
2.5.1.2.4  The balises can provide fixed messages or, when connected to a lineside electr onic 
unit, messages that can be changed.  
2.5.1.2.5  The balises will be organised in groups, each balise transmitting a telegram and the 
combination of all telegrams defining the message sent by the balise group.  
2.5.1.3  Lineside electronic unit  
2.5.1.3.1  The lineside electronic unit s are electronic devices, that generate telegrams to be sent 
by balises, on basis of information received from external trackside systems.

2.6 Levels and transitions  
2.6.1  Introduction  
2.6.1.1  The different ERTMS/ETCS application levels (short: levels) are a way to expre ss the 
possible operating relationships between track and train. Level definitions are related 
to the trackside equipment used, to the way trackside information reaches the on -
board units and to which functions are processed in the trackside and in the on -board 
equipment respectively.  
2.6.1.2  Different levels have been defined to allow each individual railway administration to 
select the appropriate ERTMS/ETCS application trackside, according to their 
strategies, to their trackside infrastructure and to the requir ed performance. 
Furthermore, the different application levels permit the interfacing of individual 
signalling systems and train control systems to ERTMS/ETCS.  
2.6.1.3  For the purpose of a consistent specification a level 0 has been defined. This level is 
used for operation on non -equipped (unfitted) lines or on lines  equip ped with train 
control system(s)  but operation under their supervision is currently not possible .  
2.6.2  Definitions  
2.6.2.1  A train equipped with ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment always co -operates with the 
ERTMS /ETCS trackside equipment in a defined ERTMS/ETCS level.  
2.6.2.2  All transitions between levels are performed according to well -specified rules.  
2.6.2.3  ERTMS/ETCS can be configured to operate in one of the following application levels:  
 ERTMS/ETCS Level 0 (train equipp ed with ERTMS/ETCS operating on a line not 
equipped with any train control system  (ERTMS/ETCS or national system ) or on a 
line equipped with ERTMS/ETCS and/or national system (s) but operation under 
their supervision is currently not possible ) 
 ERTMS/ETCS Le vel NTC (train equipped with ERTMS/ETCS operating on a line 
equipped with a national system)  
 ERTMS/ETCS Application Level 1 with or without infill transmission (train equipped 
with ERTMS/ETCS operating on a line equipped with Eurobalises and optionally 
Euroloop or Radio infill)  
 ERTMS/ETCS Application Level 2 (train equipped with ERTMS/ETCS operating on 
a line controlled by a Radio Block Centre and equipped with Eurobalises and 
Euroradio) with train position and train integrity proving performed by the track side

Basic System Description  Page 12/24 
  ERTMS/ETCS Application Level 3 (similar to level 2 but with train position and train 
integrity supervision based on information received from the train)  
2.6.2.4  It is possible to superimpose several application levels in parallel on the same track, for 
examp le to run trains without train integrity device in level 2 and in parallel trains 
equipped with train integrity device in level 3. Other examples might be a station which 
is shared by trains arriving over level 1 and level 2 lines (junctions) or parallel o peration 
of a national system with ERTMS/ETCS. Mixed levels are supported.  
2.6.2.5  Levels 1, 2 and 3 are downwards compatible. This means that : 
 a level 3 equipped train is also able to operate in level 0, level 1 and level 2 
 a level 2 equipped train is also able t o operate in level 0  and level 1  
 a level 1 equipped train is also able to operate in level 0   
2.6.2.6  Note: Operation under level NTC  is not part of the downward compatibility chain.  
2.6.2.7  It is possible to transmit information not intended for ERTMS/ETCS but for other 
systems over the ERTMS/ETCS transmission channels. This information is not used  
by ERTMS/ETCS.

 2.6.3  ERTMS/ETCS Application Level 0  
2.6.3.1  General description  
2.6.3.1.1  Level 0 covers operation of ETCS equipped trains on lines not equipped with ETCS or 
national systems or on li nes where trackside ERTMS/ETCS infrastructure and/or 
national systems may exist but operation under their supervision is currently not 
possible (e.g. commissioning or on -board/trackside failed components) .  
2.6.3.1.2  In Level 0 it is authorized to operate trains wit hout any train control system and 
therefore line side optical signals or other means of signalling are used to give 
movement authorities to the driver.  
2.6.3.1.3  ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment provides no supervision except of the maximum 
design speed of a train and  maximum speed permitted in unfitted areas.  
2.6.3.1.4  Train detection and train integrity supervision are performed by the trackside 
equipment of the underlying signalling system (interlocking, track circuits etc.) and are 
outside the scope of ERTMS/ETCS.  
2.6.3.1.5  Level 0 u ses no track -train transmission except Eurobalises to announce/command 
level transitions. Eurobalises therefore still have to be read. No balise data except 
certain special commands are interpreted.  
2.6.3.1.6  No supervisory information is indicated on the DMI except  the train speed. Train data 
has to be entered in order not to have to stop a train at a level transition to 
ERTMS/ETCS equipped area and to supervise maximum train speed.

 2.6.4  ERTMS/ETCS Application Level NTC 
2.6.4.1  General description  
2.6.4.1.1  Level NTC is used to run ERTMS/ETCS equipped trains on lines equipped with 
national train control and speed supervision systems.  
2.6.4.1.2  Train control information ge nerated trackside by the national train control system is 
transmitted to the train via the communication channels of the underlying national 
system.  
2.6.4.1.3  Note: Lineside optical signals might be necessary or not, depending on the 
performance and functionality o f the underlying systems.  
2.6.4.1.4  Intentionally deleted .  
2.6.4.1.5  The achievable level of supervision is similar to the one provided by the underlying 
national systems.  
2.6.4.1.6  Train detection and train integrity supervision are performed by equipment external to 
ERTMS/ETCS.  
2.6.4.1.7  Level NTC uses no ERTMS/ETCS track -train information  except to 
announce/command level transitions and specific commands related to balise 
transmission. Eurobalises therefore still have to be read.  
2.6.4.1.8  The information displayed to the driver depends on the funct ionality of the underlying 
national system. The active national system  is indicated to the driver as part of that 
information. Full train data has to be entered in order not to have to stop a train at a 
level transition position and to supervise maximum tr ain speed.  
2.6.4.1.9  A combination of national systems can be regarded as one NTC level.  
2.6.4.1.10  Depending on the functionality and the configuration of the specific national system 
installed onboard, the ERTMS/ETCS Onboard system may need to be interfaced to it, 
in order t o perform the transitions from/to the national system and/or in order to give 
access to ERTMS/ETCS Onboard resources (e.g. DMI). This can be achieved through 
a device called an STM (Specific Transmission Module) using a standardised interface .

 Onboard equipment with Eurobalise transmission.  
 Onboard part of the national system . 
2.6.4.2.4  Main ERTMS/ETCS on -board function:  
 No train supervision, it is fully handed over to the national system.  
 Reading of Eurobalises to detect level transitions and certain special commands.

2.6.5  ERTMS/ETCS Application Level 1  
2.6.5.1  General description  
2.6.5.1.1  ERTMS/ETCS Level 1 is a spot transmission based train control system to be used as 
an overlay on a n underlying signalling system.  
2.6.5.1.2  Movement authorities are generated trackside and are transmitted to the train via  
Eurobalises.  
2.6.5.1.3  ERTMS/ETCS Level 1 provides a continuous speed supervision system, which also 
protects against overrun of the authority.  
2.6.5.1.4  Train  detection and train integrity supervision are performed by the trackside 
equipment of the underlying signalling system (interlocking, track circuits etc.) and are 
outside the scope of ERTMS/ETCS.  
2.6.5.1.5  Level 1 is based on Eurobalises as spot transmission device s.   
2.6.5.1.6  The trackside equipment does not know the train to which it sends information.  
2.6.5.1.7  If in level 1 a lineside signal clears, an approaching train can not receive this 
information until it passes the Eurobalise group at that signal. The driver therefore has 
to observe the lineside signal to know when to proceed. The train has then to be 
permitted to approach the stopping location below a maximum permitted release 
speed.  
2.6.5.1.8  Additional Eurobalises can be placed between distant and main signals to transmit infill 
information, the train will receive new information before reaching the signal.  
2.6.5.1.9  Note: Lineside signals are required in level 1 applications, except if semi -continuous 
infill is provided.  
2.6.5.1.10  Semi -continuous infill can be provided using Euroloop or radio infil l. In this case, the 
on-board system will be able to show new information to the driver as soon as it is 
available and even at standstill.  
2.6.5.1.11  Euroloop or radio infill can improve the safety of a level 1 system as they allow the 
operation without release spee d.

 3.3 Introduction  
3.3.1  Scope and purpose  
3.3.1.1  The chapter 3, Principles, specifies the system principles of ETCS/ERTMS. These 
principles apply to on -board and trackside subsystems . 
3.3.1.2  The principles define the operational and technical behavio ur of the system in general 
and functional terms.  
3.3.1.3  The chapter is divided into subchapters. In each subchapter normally several 
requirements are defined. Each requirement is identified with a unique identification 
number.  
3.3.1.4  Notes, Justifications and Examples are only informative and shall not be regarded as 
requirements.  
3.4 Balise configuration and linking  
3.4.1  Balise Configurations – Balise Group Definition  
3.4.1.1  A balise group shall consist of between one and eight balises.  
3.4.1.2  In every balise shall at least be stored:  
a) The in ternal number (from 1 to 8) of the balise  
b) The number of balises inside the group  
c) The balise group identity.  
3.4.1.3  The internal number of the balise describes the relative position of the balise in the 
group.  
3.4.2  Balise Co -ordinate System  
3.4.2.1.1  Every balise group has its o wn co -ordinate system.  
3.4.2.1.2  The orientation of the co -ordinate system of a balise group (i.e., nominal or reverse 
direction) is identified as balise group orientation.  
3.4.2.2  Balise groups composed of two or more balises  
3.4.2.2.1  The origin of the co -ordinate system for each b alise group shall be given by the balise 
number 1 (called location reference) in the balise group.  
3.4.2.2.2  The nominal direction of each balise group is defined by increasing internal balise 
numbers.

balises (with "inherent" co -ordinate system)  
3.4.2.3.3  Level 2/3:  
3.4.2.3.3.1  If the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment cannot evaluate the orientation of the last 
balise group detected, being a single balise group, i.e. no linking information is 
available to identify the orientation of the co -ordinate system of this single balise group, 
the ERTMS/ETCS on-board  equipment shall report its position by means of a position 
report based on two balise gr oups reporting the train position in reference to the LRBG 
and the “previous LRBG”, if any.  
3.4.2.3.3.1.1  Note: Receiving this type of position report advises the RBC of the need to assign a 
co-ordinate system to this single balise group.  
3.4.2.3.3.2  When a single balise group is d etected and the previous LRBG is known, the position 
report based on two balise groups shall use as direction reference a move from the  
“previous LRBG”  towards this single balise group (being the new LRBG): directional 
information in the position report po inting in the same direction as the direction 
reference shall be reported as “nominal”, otherwise as “reverse”.  
3.4.2.3.3.3  If the “previous LRBG “ is not known, the “previous LRBG” and all directional 
information of the position report based on two balise groups shal l be reported as 
“unknown”.  
3.4.2.3.3.4  If a new single balise group (BG2), different from the current LRBG (BG1), becomes 
LRBG while the running direction of the train is opposite to the running direction when 
this current LRBG (BG1) was last passed, the “previous LR BG” and all directional

3.4.2.3.3.6  The assignment of a co -ordinate system received from the RBC shall identify the 
balise group for  which the assignment is given, and assign a balise group orientation 
“nominal” or “reverse” to this balise group

3.4.2.3.3.7  For single balise groups reported as LRBG and stored according to 3.6.2.2.2c, 
awaiting an assignment of a co -ordinate system, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 
equipment shall be able to discriminate if a single balise has been reported more than 
once and with different “previous LRBGs” to the RBC.  
3.4.2.3.3.7.1  Note: For a single balise group reported as LRBG awaiting the assignment of a co -
ordinate system also the rules for LRBGs reported to the RB C (see 3.6.2.2.2) apply.  
3.4.2.3.3.8  A co -ordinate system assignment received from trackside shall be rejected by the 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment if the referred LRBG is memorised (see 3.6.2.2.2c) 
to have been reported more than once and with different “previous LRB Gs”. 
3.4.2.3.3.8.1  Note: If a single balise group is memorised, according to 3.6.2.2.2c, more than

ambiguous.

 3.4.3  Balise Information Types and Usage  
3.4.3.1  In level 1, a ll information to the on -board system is given from balise groups or 
additionally from EUROLOOPS or Radio Infill Units  (see section 3.9). In level 2/3, 
balise groups are mostly used for location information.  
3.4.3.2  A balise may contain directional information , i.e. valid either  for nominal or for reverse 
direction , or m ay contain information valid for both directions . In level 1, t his 
information can be of the following type (please refer to section 3.8.5 ): 
a) Non-infill 
b) Intentionally deleted  
c) Infill. 
3.4.3.2.1  Intentionally deleted . 
3.4.3.2.2  Note: Infill informati on is referring to the location reference of an announced balise 
group.  
3.4.3.3  Some information shall be read also in sleeping mode and when no linking information 
is available (see Chapter 4 Use of received information). If such information is 
transmitted by bal ises, and if the information is directional, balise groups consisting of 
at least two balises shall be used.  
3.4.4  Linking  
3.4.4.1  Introduction  
3.4.4.1.1  Aim of linking:  
 To determine whether a balise group has been missed or not found within the 
expectation window (see section 3.4.4.4 ) and take the appropriate action.  
 To assign a co -ordinate system to balise groups consisting of a single balise.  
 To correct the confidence interval due to odometer inaccuracy (see section 3.6.4 ). 
3.4.4.1.2  A balise group is linked when its linking information (see section 3.4.4.2 ) is known in 
advance.  
3.4.4.1.2.1  Note: In cases where a balise group contains repositioning information, the term linked 
also applies since the balise group is announced, marked as linked and contains 
repositioning information marked accordingly.  
3.4.4.2  Content of linking information  
3.4.4.2.1  Linking information shall be composed of:  
a) The identity of the linked balise group.  
b) Where the location reference of the group has to be found.

 c) The accuracy of this location.  
Note: If the reference balise is duplicated, it is the trackside responsibility to define 
the location accuracy to cover at least the location of the two duplicated balises.  
d) The direction with which the linked balise g roup will be passed over (nominal or 
reverse).  
e) The reaction required if a data consistency problem occurs with the expected balise 
group.  
3.4.4.2.1.1  "Linking information is used" shall be interpreted as when balise group(s) are 
announced and the minimum safe antenna position has not yet passed the expectation 
window of the furthest announced balise group.  
3.4.4.2.2  Instead of the identity of a linked balise group it shall be possible to identify a following 
linked balise group as unknown but containing repositioning information  
3.4.4.2.2.1  Intentionally deleted.  
3.4.4.2.2.2  Note 1: Regarding the repositioning information, see chapter 3.8.5.3.5  and 3.8.5.2.  
3.4.4.2.2.3  Note 2: In case the identity of the next balise group is not unambiguously known 
because the route is not known by the trackside, this feature allows to link this balise 
group.  
3.4.4.2.3  For each linked balise group , the trackside shall select one of the following reactions to 
be used in case of data inconsistencies:  
a) Train trip  (Trip mode, see Chapter 4)  
b) Command service brake  
c) No reaction  
For further details see section 3.16.2 . 
3.4.4.3  Unlinked Balise Groups  
3.4.4.3.1  A balise group, which contains information that must be considered even when the 
balise group is not announced by linking, is called an unlinked balise grou p.  
3.4.4.3.2  Unlinked balise groups shall consist at minimum of two balises.   
3.4.4.3.3  Unlinked balise groups shall always contain the unlinked balise group qualifier.  
3.4.4.4  Rules related to linking  
3.4.4.4.1  When no linking information is used on -board, all balise groups shall be taken i nto 
account.  
3.4.4.4.2  When linking information is used on -board, only balise groups marked as linked and 
included in the linking information and balise groups marked as unlinked shall be taken 
into account.

 3.4.4.4.2.1  When linking information is used on -board and the expected  balise group is referred in 
the linking information with a balise group with ID “unknown”, a balise group marked as 
linked shall only be taken into account if:  
a) the on-board equipment  can determine the orientation of the linked balise group by 
information from the balise group itself (therefore excluding for example single 
balise groups), AND  
b) the balise group contains repositioning information valid for the train orientation, 
AND  
c) the balise group is crossed with the direction announced in the linking inform ation.  
3.4.4.4.3  The on -board equipment shall accept a balise group marked as linked and included in 
the linking information (i.e. the balise giving the location reference) from  
 when the max safe front end of the train has passed the first possible location of 
the balise group  
until  
 the min safe front end of the train has passed the last possible location of the 
balise group  
taking the offset between the front of the train and the balise antenna into account.  
3.4.4.4.3.1  Note: The first possible location and the last possible  location of the balise group are 
defined by the linking distance and the location accuracy.  
3.4.4.4.3.2  Note: The interval between the outer limits to accept the balise group defines the 
expectation window.  
3.4.4.4.4  In case of a balise group containing repositioning informati on, the first possible location 
shall start from the previously linked balise group.  
3.4.4.4.5  The on -board equipment shall expect balise groups one by one (i.e., it shall supervise 
only one expectation window at a time) according to the order given by linking 
information.  
3.4.4.4.6  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall stop expecting a balise group and shall 
expect the next one announced in the linking information (if any) when:  
a) the balise group is found inside its expectation window  
b) a linking consistency error is found, se e 3.16.2.3.1  
3.4.4.4.6.1  Linking consistency error due to early reception of balise group expected later (see 
3.16.2.3.1 c)): if the balise group found is the next one announced in the linking 
information, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall check its linking cons istency 
and apply again clause 3.4.4.4.6, i.e. it will immediately expect the further next balise 
group announced in the linking information.

3.5.4.1  When a communication session is established , in case of a loss of the safe radio 
connection, i.e., if the disconnection has not been ordered (see 3.5.5.1), the involved 
entities shall consider the communication session still established for a defined t ime. 
The defined time shall start as soon as EURORADIO has indicated the loss of the safe 
radio connection.  
3.5.4.2  When EURORADIO indicates the loss of the safe radio connection, the ERTMS/ETCS 
on-board equipment shall immediately try to set -up a new safe radio c onnection.  
3.5.4.2.1  If the safe radio connection is not re -established after the defined time (as defined in

terminated . 
3.5.4.3  The attempts shall be repeated, until at least one of the following  conditions is met:  
 The safe radio connection is set -up. 
 The session is considered as terminated.  
 The train passes the location indicated in the RIU order “Terminate the 
communication session”

3.5.4.5  In case a message has to be sent during the loss of the safe radio connection, this 
message shall be considered as sent . 
3.5.5  Terminating a communication session  
3.5.5.1  The termination of a communication session shall be initiated only by the on -board and 
in the following cases:  
a) If an order is received from trackside (RBC , RIU  or balise groups) (see section s 
3.5.3.5 and 3.5.3.6 concer ning the content of the order).  
b) If an error condition requiring the termination of the communication session is 
detected on -board (e.g., not compatible system versions between on -board and 
trackside).  
c) The train is rejected by RBC during Start of Mission.  
d) If the driver closes the desk during Start of Mission.  
e) In case the train has reported having exited from an RBC area and no order to 
terminate the session is received  within a fixed waiting time (see Appendix A.3.1 ) 
from the time the position report was sen t, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment 
shall repeated ly send a position report  with the fixed waiting time after each 
repetition, until the order to terminate the session is received, or  the defined number 
of repetitions  (see Appendix A .3.1) has been reached . If no reply is received within 
the fixed waiting time  after the last repetition,  the ERTMS/ETCS on-board 
equipment shall terminate the communication session.  
f) In case of communication session with an RIU: the Level 1 is left, or, an End of 
Mission is exec uted.  
3.5.5.2  In case a session is established, t he on -board equipment shall terminate the 
communication session according to the following steps:  
a) The on -board equipment shall send a Termination of communication session 
message.  
b) As soon as this information is rec eived, the trackside shall consider the 
communication session terminated and send an acknowledgement to the on -board.  
c) When the acknowledgement is received the on -board shall consider the 
communication session terminated and request the release of the safe radio 
connection with trackside.

 3.5.6  Registering to the Radio Network  
3.5.6.1  ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall order the registration of its connected Mobile 
Terminal(s) to a Radio Network:  
a) At power -up 
b) Following driver entry of a new Radio Network identity  (only if level 2 or 3)  
c) If ordered from the trackside  
3.5.6.2  When po wered -off, ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall memorize the last 
received Radio Network identity (from trackside or from driver) and shall use it when 
powered -up again.  
3.5.6.3  If no Radio Network identity received from trackside or from driver could have been 
mem orized by ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment (e.g. after a System Failure or at 
very first power -up), this latter shall nevertheless order the registration of its Mobile 
Terminal(s) to a default Radio Network.  
3.5.6.3.1  Note 1: the source used to retrieve the default Rad io Network identity (on -board 
equipment permanent storage, Mobile Terminal itself, or other external source) is 
implementation dependent.  
3.5.6.3.2  Note 2: if ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment is powered -up in an area not covered by 
the memorized or default Radio Netwo rk, attempts to register to this Radio Network will 
be repeated unconditionally by the Mobile Terminal(s) until either an attempt is 
successful or a new Radio Network identity is received from trackside or from driver, 
preventing Mobile Terminal(s) from re gistering to any unwanted Radio Network . 
3.5.6.4  Note: for Radio Network identity data entry by driver during SoM, please refer to 
chapter 5 (Procedure Start of Mission).  
3.5.6.5  On reception of the trackside order, ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall 
immediately order th e Radio Network registration of each Mobile Terminal that fulfils 
the following conditions:  
a) it is not yet registered to the ordered Radio Network, AND  
b) it is not used for an established communication session, AND  
c) no safe radio connection is being set -up 
3.5.6.6  If a Mobile Terminal is not currently registered to the Radio Network ordered by 
trackside and if one of the conditions b) or c) is not fulfilled, ERTMS/ETCS on -board 
equipment shall initiate the Radio Network registration once communication session is 
termin ated and safe radio connection is released.  
3.5.6.7  If no Mobile Terminal is duly registered to a Radio Network, any order to contact an 
RBC or an RIU received from trackside shall be rejected by ERTMS/ETCS on -board 
equipment.

 3.5.7  Safe Radio Connection Indication  
3.5.7.1  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall inform the driver about the status of the 
safe radio connection. To that purpose, the following indication statuses of the safe 
radio connection are defined: “No Connection”, “Connection Lost/Set -Up failed”, 
“Connection Up”. 
3.5.7.2  In addition, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall use a “connection status” 
timer (see Appendix A.3.1), in order to manage properly the transitions to the indication 
status “Connection Lost/Set -Up failed”.  
3.5.7.2.1  Note: The purpose of the “connection statu s” timer is to avoid distracting the driver for 
any short disturbance of the safe radio connection.  
3.5.7.3  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall start the “connection status” timer as 
soon as the first request to set -up a safe radio connection with the relevant  RBC/RIU is 
sent:  
a) for what regards the session establishment, see items b), c), d), e) in 3.5.3.4.  
b) for what regards maintaining a communication session, see 3.5.4.2 and 3.5.4.4  
3.5.7.4  If the “connection status” timer is ongoing, it shall be stopped if the request s to set -up 
a safe radio connection are stopped with the relevant RBC/RIU . 
3.5.7.5  The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall execute the transitions between the 
different indication statuses of the safe radio connection with the relevant RBC/RIU as 
described in Table 1 according to the conditions in Table 2 (see section 4.6.1 for 
details about the symbols).

Handing over RBC to the one with the Accepting RBC as soon as one of the following 
conditions is met:  
a) the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipmen t sends a position report directly to the 
Accepting RBC with its maximum safe front end having passed the border, see 
3.15.1.3.5 (i.e. the Accepting RBC becomes the supervising RBC),  
b) the safe radio connection is released with the Handing over RBC and the m inimum 
safe rear end of the train has crossed the border, see 3.5.5.1  e) and 3.15.1.2.7.  
3.5.7.6.1  Note: During an RBC/RBC handover procedure, an indication status transition table 
and a connection status timer might have to be managed at the same time, for each 
RBC . 
3.5.7.7  For the case of safe radio connection with RIU’s, the safe radio connection indicated to

3.6 Location Principles,  Train Position and Train Orientation  
3.6.1  General  
3.6.1.1  It shall be possible to identify:  
a) Data that refers only to a given location, referred to as Location data (e.g. level 
transition orders, linking)

3.6.1.3  The Train Position information defines the position of the train front in relation  to a 
balise group, which is called LRBG ( the Last Relevant Balise Group). It includes:  
 The estimated train front end position, defined by the estimated di stance between 
the LRBG and the front end of the train  
 The train position confidence interval (see 3.6.4)  
 Directional train position information in reference to the balise group orientation 
(see 3.4.2, also Figure 14) of the LRBG, regarding:  
 the position o f the train front end (nominal or reverse side of the LRBG)  
 the train orientation  
 the train running direction  
In case of an LRBG being a single balise group with no co -ordinate system 
assigned, directional information is defined in reference to the pair o f LRBG and 
“previous LRBG”, see 3.4.2.3.3  
 A list of LRBGs, which may alternatively be used by trackside for referencing 
location dependent information (see 3.6.2.2.2  c)). 
3.6.1.4  Balise groups, which are marked as unlinked, shall never be used as LRBG.

 3.6.1.4.1  Justificati on: The location of an unlinked balise group, or the balise group itself, may 
not be known to the RBC.  
3.6.1.5  If there is an active cab, this one defines the orientation of the train, i.e . the side of the 
active cab shall be considered as the front of the train. If no cab is active, the train 
orientation shall be as when a cab was last active.  
3.6.1.6  The “train orientation relative to LRBG” is defined as the train orientation related to the 
orientation of the LRBG, see Figure 14. It can be either “no minal” or “reverse”.  
3.6.1.6.1  Note: The train orientation cannot be affected by the direction controller position.  
3.6.2  Location of Data Transmitted to the On -Board Equipment  
3.6.2.1  Data Transmitted by Balises  
3.6.2.1.1  All location and profile data transmitted by a balise shall refer t o the location reference 
and orientation of the balise group to which the balise belongs.  
3.6.2.1.2  Exception: Regarding infill information see section 3.6.2.3.1 . 
3.6.2.2  Data Transmitted by Radio from RBC  
3.6.2.2.1  All location and profile data transmitt ed from the RBC shall refer to the location 
reference and orientation of the LRBG given in the same message.  
3.6.2.2.2  For the LRBG the following requirements have to be met:  
a) The on -board equipment shall use the last balise group passed as a reference 
when reporting  its position to the RBC (in the following termed as LRBG ONB). Only  
 balise groups marked as linked and contained in the previously received linking 
information, if linking information is used on -board  
 or  
 the last balise group not marked as unlinked, if no linking was used when this 
balise group was passed  
shall be regarded.  
b) The RBC shall use the last relevant balise group which was reported by the on -
board equipment as a reference (in the following termed as LRBG RBC). At a certain 
moment LRBG RBC and LRBG ONB can be different.  
c) The on -board equipment shall be able to accept information referring to one of at 
least eight LRBG ONB last reported to the RBC.  
3.6.2.2.2.1  Exception  to a) : When on -board position is unknown or when position data has been 
deleted during SoM proce dure, the on -board equipment shall use an LRBG identifier 
set to "unknown" until the onboard has validated its position again by passing a balise 
group .

 3.6.2.2.2.2  Exception to b): When the RBC has received from the onboard an unknown position, 
or an invalid position  which it is not able to confirm during SoM procedure, the RBC 
shall use an LRBG identifier set to "unknown" until it receives a position report from the 
onboard having validated its position by passing a balise group.  
3.6.2.2.2.3  Regarding c):  From the time it has re ported an unknown position, or an  invalid position 
during SoM procedure, to the time it has received from the RBC a message with an 
LRBG not set to “unknown”, the on -board equipment shall also be able to accept 
messages from the RBC containing LRBG “unknow n”.

 3.6.2.4.1  It shall be possible to transmit non -infill location data by loop, which refers to a balise 
group as location reference.  
3.6.2.4.1.1  Note: Regarding infill information see section 3.6.2.3.  
3.6.2.4.2  The orientation of data transmitted by a loop is determined by the EOLM information 
which indicates how the directional information contained in loop messages is to be 
interpreted.  
3.6.3  Validity direction of transmitted Information  
3.6.3.1  General  
3.6.3.1.1  The direction for which transmitted information is valid shall refer to:  
a) the directi on of the LRBG for information sent by radio  
b) the direction of the balise group sending the information.  
3.6.3.1.2  Data transmitted to the on -board equipment (by balise or radio) shall be identified as 
being valid for  
a) both directions  
b) the nominal direction  
c) the reverse  direction  
of the referenced balise group.  
3.6.3.1.2.1  Deleted.  
3.6.3.1.3  When receiving information from any transmission medium, the ERTMS/ETCS  on-
board equipment shall only take into account information valid for its orientation. Other 
information shall be ignored. Exception : for SL , PS  and SH engines, balise group 
crossing direction shall be considered.  
3.6.3.1.3.1  If the train position is unknown, data received from any transmission medium valid for 
one direction only (nominal or reverse) shall be rejected by the onboard equipment. 
Data valid for both directions shall be evaluated (see section 4.8).  
3.6.3.1.4  If no co -ordinate system has been assigned to a single balise group, data transmitted 
by trackside, which refers to that balise group requiring the co -ordinate system to be 
known (i.e. all d ata which are only valid for one direction (nominal or reverse) ) shall be 
rejected by the ERTMS/ETCS  on-board equipment . Data valid for both directions shall 
be evaluated (see section 4.8).  
3.6.3.1.4.1  Exception: if not rejected due to balise group message consistency  check (see 
3.16.2.4.4.1 and 3.16.2.5.1.1), data to be forwarded to a National System (see section 
3.15.6) shall be accepted. Justification: the co -ordinate system of the balise group 
might be known to the National System by other means inherent to the Nat ional 
System itself .

b) For distance (1) the previously received data shall be used (in case of an SSP this 
includes train length delay, refer to 3.11.3.1.3).  
c) Distances shall be given as unsigned incremental values representing the distance

c) Each value (n) may represent a single value or a set of data.  
3.6.3.2.4  According to Figure 12 the structure for non -continuous profile data shall allow to 
contain multiple elements (value (n) for len gth(n )) inside the profile.  
a) Distance to the start of each element (value(n) for length(n)) shall be given as 
unsigned incremental values , each increment representing the distance between  
starts of element (n) and element (n -1). 
b) For distance (1) the previ ously received data (or initial data/default values, see

c) Each value (n) may represent a single value or a set of data.  
d) Note: There is no relationship between length of element (n -1) and distance (n) , i.e., 
elements may overlap.  
3.6.3.2.5  It shall be possible for the RBC to shift the location reference, e.g., after a change of 
train orientation or running direction.  
3.6.3.2.5.1  Justification: Refer to Figure 13. To make it possible  to shift the location reference if – 
due to the location of the LRBG and the start location – distance (1) would become a

3.6.4.1  All location related informat ion transmitted from trackside equipment shall be used by 
the on -board equipment taking into account the confidence interval to the train 
position, if required for safe operation.  
3.6.4.2  The confidence interval to the train position shall refer to the distance to  the LRBG and 
shall take into account  
a) On-board over-reading amount and under -reading amount  (odometer accuracy plus 
the error in detection of  the balise group location reference)  
b) The location accuracy of the LRBG.  
3.6.4.2.1  Distance information received from tracksi de shall be evaluated on -board as nominal 
information  (without taking into account any  tolerances ).

 3.6.4.2.2  Note: The confidence interval increases in relation to the distance travelled from the 
LRBG  depending on the accuracy of odometer equipment  until it is rese t when another 
balise group becomes the LRBG . 
3.6.4.2.3  The value of the Location Accuracy shall be determined by Linking information if 
available, if not, by the corresponding National Value, or the corresponding Default 
Value if the National Value is not applicabl e. 
3.6.4.3  When another balise group becomes the LRBG or when evaluating (see section 4.8) 
location related trackside information, which is referred to a previously received balise 
group different from the LRBG, all the location related information shall be reloca ted by 
subtracting from the distances that are counted from the reference balise group of the 
location related information:  
a) the distance between the reference balise group of the location related information 
and the LRBG, retrieved from linking information  if it is available and it includes both 
the reference balise group and the LRBG, OR  
b) in all other cases, the estimated travelled distance between the reference balise 
group of the location related information and the LRBG.  
3.6.4.3.1  Justification: it is always the t rackside responsibility to provide linking in due course, 
knowing this rule; if the location related information is to be used in situations where 
linking is not provided (e.g. TSR transmitted by balise group marked as unlinked), the 
trackside can include provisions, if deemed necessary, when engineering the distance 
information .

3.8 Movement authority  
3.8.1  Characteristics of a MA  
3.8.1.1  The following characteristics can be used in a Movement Authority (see Figure 17: 
Structure of an MA ): 
a) The End Of Authority (EOA) is the location to w hich the train is authorised to move.  
ERA * UNISIG * EEIG ERTMS USERS GROUP  
 
 
SUBSET -026-3 
3.4.0 
12/05/14  System Requirements Specification  
Chapter 3  
Principles  Page 48/200 
 b) The Target Speed at the EOA is the permitted speed at the EOA; when the target 
speed is not zero, the EOA is called the Limit of Authority (LOA). This target speed 
can be time limited.  
c) If no overlap exists, the Danger Point is a location beyond the EOA that can be 
reached by the front end of the train without a risk for a hazardous situation.  
d) The end of an overlap (if used in the existing interlocking system) is a location 
beyond the Danger Point that  can be reached by  the front end of the train without a 
risk for a hazardous situation. This additional distance is only valid for a defined 
time.  
e) A release speed is a speed limit under which the train is allowed to run in the vicinity 
of the EOA, when the target speed is z ero. One release speed can be associated 
with the Danger Point, and another one with the overlap. Release speed can also 
be calculated on -board the train (see section 3.13.9.4 ). 
f) The MA can be split into several sections, The la st one is called End Section.  
 A first time -out value can be attached to each section. This value will be used for 
the revocation of the associated route when the train has not entered into it yet. It is 
called the Section time -out.  
 In addition, a second t ime-out value can be attached to the End Section of the 
MA. This second time -out will be used for the revocation of the last section when it 
is occupied by the train; it is called the End Section time -out. 
3.8.1.2  The values of the time -outs possibly given in an M A shall take into account the time 
elapsed from the start of validity of information to the sending of the message.  
3.8.1.3  Note: A Danger Point can be (not exhaustive list):  
 the entry point of an occupied block section (if the line is operated according to 
fixed block principles)  
 the position of the safe rear end of a train (if the line is operated according to 
moving block principles)  
 the fouling point of a switch, positioned for a route, conflicting with the current 
direction of movement of the train (both for f ixed and moving block mode of 
operation)  
3.8.1.4  Note: Traditionally the overlap is a piece of track (beyond the danger point), that is put 
at disposal of a train, to guarantee a non hazardous situation, also in case the driver 
should misjudge the stopping distanc e for the train. In ERTMS/ETCS the overlap can 
be used to improve the efficiency of the braking supervision.  
3.8.1.5  Note: Time -out values can be given in the MA to cope with the following situations 
depending on the interlocking operations, i.e. the timers on -board will only reflect the 
situation trackside and when expired (on -board) the actions taken are restrictive:

Principles  Page 49/200 
 a) Section time -out or time -out for the speed at the EOA/LOA: When a signalman 
requests a route release of a part of a route not yet entered by the app roaching 
train.  
b) End Section time -out: When the train has entered the last part of a route, the 
automatic route release can be delayed to make sure that the train has come to a 
standstill before any switches inside the route can be moved.  
c) Time -out for an ov erlap: When the train has entered the last part of a route, the 
overlap associated with the route remains valid for a certain time to make sure that 
the train has successfully stopped before its end of authority. If the overlap is still 
unoccupied when the  timer expires the interlocking revokes the overlap.  
3.8.1.6  Note:  If the trackside equipment does not have enough information to give the distance 
to End Of Authority (with target speed equal to zero) a target speed higher than zero 
can be given (speed at LOA, Li mit Of Authority). It is the responsibility of the trackside 
to ensure that the safe distance beyond the EOA/LOA is long enough to brake the train 
from the target speed to a stand still without any hazardous situation. It is the 
responsibility of the on -board equipment to apply the brakes if no new information is 
received when the Limit of Authority is passed.  
3.8.2  MA request to the RBC  
3.8.2.1  It shall be possible for the on -board equipment to request a new Movement Authority 
from the RBC.  
3.8.2.2  The parameters for requesti ng a new MA shall be given by the RBC.  
3.8.2.3  In level 2/3, the following possibilities shall be available:  
a) A defined time before the train reaches the pre-indication location (see section 3.13) 
for the EOA/LOA assuming it is running  at the warning speed.  
b) A defined time before the Section timer (not the End Section timer, not the Overlap 
timer) for any section of the MA expires , or before the LOA speed timer expires . 
3.8.2.3.1  Regards to the above possibilities, the MA request shall be triggere d when the train 
front has passed the resulting location (regards a)/ time (regards b)  
3.8.2.4  It shall be possible to define whether the MA request shall be repeated until a new MA 
is received or not and if so, the time between each repetition.  
3.8.2.5  The given data sha ll be valid until new MA request parameters are given from the 
RBC.  
3.8.2.6  In case no MA request parameters are stored on -board and following an MA request 
no MA has been received, the request shall be repeated with a repetition cycle 
according to a fixed value ( see appendix).  
3.8.2.7  In level 2/3: an MA request shall be sent to the RBC when the driver selects start.

"Track ahead free up to level 2/3 transition location" is received from balise group.  
3.8.2.7.2  In level 0 , 1, NTC: the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall also inform the RBC 
about the identity of the level 2/3 transition location balise group, as rec eived through 
the information "Track ahead free up to level 2/3 transition location".  
3.8.2.7.3  In level 2/3: An MA request shall be sent to the RBC when any part of the track 
description is deleted according to A3.4, except for situations a, b, f, k.  
3.8.2.8  Together with the MA request the on -board shall inform the RBC about the reason(s) 
why the MA request is sent:  
a) Start selection by driver,  
b) Time before reaching pre-indication l ocation  for the EOA/LOA reached,  
c) Time before a section timer or the L OA speed timer expires rea ched,  
d) The track description has been deleted , 
e) Track ahead free up to level 2/3 transition location . 
3.8.3  Structure of a Movement Authority (MA)  
3.8.3.1  The distance to End of Authority (EOA) can be composed of several sections.  
3.8.3.2  For each section composing the MA the fol lowing information shall be given;  
a) Length of the section  
b) Optionally, Section time -out value and distance from beginning of section to Section 
timer stop location  
3.8.3.3  In addition, the End Section of the MA may include;

the end of the last section  
b) Danger point information (distance from end of section to danger point, release 
speed related to danger point)

3.8.3.3.1  Note: If only one section is given in the MA it is regarded as the End Sec tion. 
3.8.3.4  The Section timer stop location shall be inside of the corresponding section.  
3.8.3.4.1  Note: the End Section and Overlap timer start locations may be outside their 
corresponding section. One example can be seen referring to figure 22c: An infill MA 
towards a signal at stop will replace the previous End Section by a new short End 
Section starting at the infill location reference and ending at the next main signal, 
however the End Section and Overlap timer start locations still have to be consistent 
with the Int erlocking timer start locations. Another example is when a timer start 
location is in rear of the LRBG.  
3.8.3.5  In level 3, no time -outs shall be used.  
3.8.3.5.1  Note: For level 3 functionality the split of responsibility between the RBC and the 
Interlocking has to be consi dered. Time -out of routes and related overlap can not be 
based on train position reports since the position report can be delayed compared to 
the real position of the train. The route release and revocation of routes can not be 
carried out by the interlock ing until permitted by the RBC.  
3.8.3.6  When an MA is transmitted by a balise group, the length of the first section shall refer 
to the balise co -ordinate system of that balise group.  
3.8.3.7  In case a main signal is at danger in level 1, the first section shall give the distance 
from the balise group at the main signal to the location of the main signal, i.e. the 
distance to EOA is given. Where available, information concerning danger point and 
overlap for this EOA may also be given.

 3.8.3.7.1  Justification: The balise group is no t necessarily placed at the same location as the 
signal and thus an infill message (which includes the same information as the balise 
group at the main signal) could change the location of the EOA to a position closer to 
the train.  
3.8.3.8  In case the main signal  is at danger in level 1, the on -board shall supervise the given 
distance (specified in section 3.8.3.7 ) as the distance to EOA.  
3.8.3.9  When an MA is transmitted by radio from the RBC, the length of the first section shall 
refer to th e balise co -ordinate system of the LRBG given in the same message.  
3.8.3.10  It shall be possible to give the length of a section to any location in the track.

3.8.4.1  End Section Time -Out 
3.8.4.1.1  The End Section timer shall be starte d on -board when the train passes the End 
Section timer start location given by trackside with its max safe front end.  
3.8.4.1.2  When the End Section timer value becomes greater than the time -out value given by 
trackside, the following shall apply:  
a) The EOA/LOA shall be withdrawn to the current position of the train . Refer to 
appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of location based information stored on -board, 
which shall be deleted accordingly ; 
b) if any,  a non zero target speed value at the EOA/LOA shall be set to zero.  
3.8.4.1.3  In case no End Section timer is running when the on -board receives a new MA with an 
End Section timer start location in rear of the max safe front end of the train, the on -
board shall consider that the End Section timer value became greater than its time -out 
value and apply 3.8.4.1.2 . 
3.8.4.1.3.1  Justification: in this case the train is already beyond the timer start location, therefore it 
is impossible to determine when that location was crossed and so what share of the 
time-out value has elapsed since the crossing e vent. The safe assumption is to 
consider that the time -out value has been exceeded and therefore that the End Section 
will soon be released by the Interlocking.  
3.8.4.1.4  In case an End Section timer is already running when the on -board receives a new MA 
with an End  Section timer start location in rear of the max safe front end of the train, 
the on -board shall keep the End Section timer running but replace the time -out value 
with the value received with the new MA.  
3.8.4.1.4.1  Justification: this allows repetition of the MA via RBC (e.g. acknowledgment of current 
MA was lost) without unintentionally affecting the End Section timer.

 3.8.4.2.1  The on -board shall start a Section timer for each section:  
a) For Level 2: at the value of the time stamp of the message including the MA. 
b) For Level 1: at the time of passage over the first encountered balise of the balise 
group giving the MA.  
3.8.4.2.1.1  Justification for b): This is to ensure that the timer is always started before or at the 
same time as the related variable information is received . Thus the timer start is 
independent of in which balise the variable information is given.  
3.8.4.2.2  When a Section timer value becomes greater than the time -out value given by 
trackside , the following shall apply:  
a) the EOA /LOA and the SvL shall be withdrawn to the  entry point of the revoked 
section . Refer to appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of location based information 
stored on -board, which shall be deleted accordingly ; 
b) the National/ Default Value of the Release Speed shall apply ;  
c) if any, a non zero target  speed value at the EOA/LOA shall be set to zero.  
3.8.4.2.2.1  Intentionally deleted.  
3.8.4.2.3  The Section timer shall be stopped when the min safe front end of the train has passed 
the associated Section timer stop location.  
3.8.4.3  Time -out of the speed associated with the EOA/LOA  
3.8.4.3.1  The on-board shall start a timer for the speed at the EOA/LOA:  
a) For Level 2: at the value of the time stamp of the message including the MA.  
b) For Level 1: at the time of passage over the first encountered balise of the balise 
group giving the MA.  
3.8.4.3.1.1  Justification  for b): This is to ensure that the timer is always started before or at the 
same time as the related variable information is received. Thus the timer start is 
independent of in which balise the variable information is given.  
3.8.4.3.2  When the LOA speed timer value  becomes greater than the time-out value given by 
trackside , the speed associated with the EOA/LOA shall be set to zero (i.e. the Limit of 
Authority becomes an End of Authority  and the SvL  is defined on -board according to 
3.8.4.5) . Refer to appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of location based information 
stored on -board, which shall be deleted accordingly.  
3.8.4.4  Time -out of Overlap  
3.8.4.4.1  The Overlap timer shall be started on -board when the train passes the Overlap timer 
start location given by trackside with its ma x safe front end.  The timer shall be 
considered as started even if a time -out value “infinite” is given.

 3.8.4.4.2  When the Overl ap timer value becomes greater than the time -out value given by 
trackside, the following shall apply:  
a) the overlap information shall be deleted , i.e. the Supervised Location shall be  
withdrawn to the Danger Point if there is any or else to the EOA.  Refer to appendix 
A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of location based information stored on -board, which 
shall be deleted accordingly.  
b) the release sp eed associated with the Overlap shall be deleted  
c) if any, a non zero target speed value at the E OA/LOA shall be set to zero.  
3.8.4.4.3  If the train comes to a standstill after the Overlap timer has been started, the on-board 
shall consider that the Overlap timer valu e became greater than its time -out value and 
shall apply 3.8.4.4.2 . 
3.8.4.4.4  In case no Overlap timer is running when the on -board receives a new MA with an 
Overlap timer start location in rear of the max safe front end of the train, the on -board 
shall consider tha t the Overlap timer value became greater than its time-out value  and 
shall apply 3.8.4.4.2.  
3.8.4.4.4.1  Justification: in this case the train is already beyond the timer start location, therefore it 
is impossible to determine when that location was crossed and so what  share of the 
time-out value has elapsed since the crossing event. The safe assumption is to 
consider that the time -out value has been exceeded a nd therefore that the Overlap will 
soon be released by the Interlocking.  
3.8.4.4.5  In case an Overlap timer is already ru nning when the on -board receives a new MA with 
an Overlap timer start location in rear of the max safe front end of the train, the on -
board shall keep the Overlap timer running but replace the Overlap time-out value with 
the value received with the new MA.  
3.8.4.4.5.1  Justification: this allows repetition of the MA via RBC (e.g. acknowledgment of current 
MA was lost) without unintentionally affecting the Overlap timer.  
3.8.4.5  Supervised Location  
3.8.4.5.1  The Supervised Location  (SvL) shall be defined on board as;  
a) the end of overlap (i f any and before time -out). 
b) if not, the Danger Point (if any).  
c) if not, the End Of Authority.  
3.8.4.5.2  As long as a Limit of Authority is supervised, no SvL shall be defined on -board.  
3.8.4.6  Infill MA (level 1 only)  
3.8.4.6.1  An MA given by an infill device is called an infill MA.

 3.8.4.6.2  An infill MA shall be evaluated on -board only if the on -board equipment is in FS or LS 
mode.  
3.8.4.6.3  The infill information shall include the identity of the balise group at the next main 
signal i.e. the identity of the balise group giving the information that is t ransmitted in 
advance by the infill device.  
3.8.4.6.4  An infill MA shall be evaluated on -board only if the linking information, regarding the 
main signal balise group to which it refers, is available.  
3.8.4.6.5  The on -board shall start a Section timer for each section beyond the next main signal:  
a) When the infill information is received from a balise group at the time of passing the 
first encountered balise of the infill balise group.  
b) When the infill information is received from a loop at the time of receiving the loop 
message . 
c) When the infill information is received from a radio infill unit at the value of the time 
stamp of the radio infill message including the MA.  
3.8.5  MA Update  
3.8.5.1  A new MA shall replace a previously received  MA in the following ways : 
a) When the new MA is given from a balise group at a main signal (i.e. not infill 
information) or from the RBC all data included in the previous MA shall be replaced 
by the new data.  
b) When the new MA is given as infill information all data beyond the announced 
balise group at the next main signal shall be replaced.  
3.8.5.1.1  Note: This refers to all information included in the MA as listed in section 3.8.1.1  and 
the Signalling related speed restriction (see section 3.11.6 ). 
3.8.5.1.2  When an infill MA is  received, the on -board shall start a new MA section at the infill 
location reference, i.e. the balise group at the next main signal (see 3.6.2.3.1).  
3.8.5.1.3  If the SvL defined from the new MA is closer than the one supervised with the former 
MA, this shall be con sidered by the on -board equipment as an MA shortening. Refer to 
appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of location based information stored on -board, 
which shall be deleted accordingly.  
3.8.5.1.4  If a new MA defines an SvL while the on -board was supervising an LOA, this shall 
always be considered by the on -board equipment as an MA shortening regardless of 
the SvL location. Refer to appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of location based 
information stored on -board, which shall be deleted accordingly.  
3.8.5.2  It shall be pos sible to update the length of the current section by means of 
repositioning information (see section 3.8.5.3 ).

 3.8.5.2.1  Note: The current section need not be the end section.  
3.8.5.2.2  Repositioning information contained in a balise group message  shall only be evaluated 
if linking information has announced a following balise group as unknown but 
containing repositioning information.  
3.8.5.2.3  A balise group message containing a movement authority shall not contain 
repositioning information for the same dire ction.  
3.8.5.2.3.1  Note: It is possible to combine repositioning with an infill MA.

3.8.6  Co-operative shortening of MA (Level 2 and 3 only)  
3.8.6.1  It shall be possible to shorten a given MA using a special procedure between on -board 
equipment and RBC. The procedure is as follows:  
a) The RBC proposes a new MA with an E OA closer to the t rain than the current EOA, 
optionally with a mode profile .

Principles  Page 64/200 
 b) The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall check the train front end position 
versus the Indication supervision limit of the proposed shortened MA . 
 If it is in rear , the on -board equipment shall accep t the new MA. 
 If it is in advance , the request shall be rejected and the previously received MA 
remains valid  
c) The RBC shall be informed about the decision.  
3.8.6.2  If the request from the RBC is granted by the on -board, refer to appendix A.3.4 for the 
exhaustive l ist of location based information, which shall be deleted accordingly.  
3.9 Means to transmit Infill information (Level 1 only)  
3.9.1  General  
3.9.1.1  It shall be possible to transmit infill information to the on -board equipment using  
a) Balise groups  
b) Euroloops  
c) Radio infill unit s. 
3.9.1.1.1  Note: If the information transmitted by Balise groups, Euroloops, and Radio includes 
infill information , those devices are al so identified as infill devices.  
3.9.1.2  The principle used for the infill information shall be the same independent of 
transmission med ia. 
3.9.1.3  If the on -board system is not equipped with the infill transmission media as requested 
by the announcement balise group, the announcement information shall be ignored by 
the on -board equipment and the train shall proceed according to the previously 
received information.  
3.9.1.4  Note: No additional description is needed for infill by balise group (other than already 
covered in previous chapters).  
3.9.2  Infill by loop  
3.9.2.1  An End Of Loop Marker (EOLM) is by definition a device to mark the beginning or the 
end of a loop. Wh en receiv ing this information, the on -board equipment knows that it is 
entering/leav ing a track equipped with a loop. In unidirectional applications it shall be 
possible to have an EOLM only at the entry side of a loop.  
3.9.2.2  Balise groups shall be used as EOL Ms. They act as an EOLM by sending the EOLM 
information to the passing train.  
3.9.2.3  EOLMs have an orientation that is identical to the balise group orientation. The general 
rules for balise orientation therefore also apply to EOLMs.

Chapter 3  
Principles  Page 65/200 
 3.9.2.4  EOLM information might be c ontained in a balise group that contains other information.  
3.9.2.5  The EOLM shall send the identity of the announced loop.  
3.9.2.6  The on -board shall only accept information coming from the loop with the announced 
identity.  
3.9.2.7  Deleted.  
3.9.2.8  Deleted.  
3.9.2.9  The following information shall be sent in advance by the EOLM to prepare for 
reception of the loop information:  
 Loop identity used to identify the loop.  
 Key to select the spread spectrum key necessary to receive the loop telegrams.  
 Distance to the loop giving the distance from th e EOLM to the location from where 
on loop messages can be received.  
 Length of the loop giving the length of the loop over which messages can be 
received.  
 Indicator telling the on -board whether the orientation of the loop is identical or 
reverse to the or ientation of the announcing EOLM.  
3.9.2.10  The on -board shall be prepared to receive messages from the Euroloop after passing 
the EOLM.  
3.9.2.11  When the on -board equipment reads the next main signal balise group or when it 
detects that the next main signal balise group wa s missed, new infill information 
possibly received from the loop shall be ignored.  
3.9.2.12  The distances given in an EOLM (distance to loop, length of loop) are used for 
diagnostic purpose only. They shall therefore not be used to restrict reception of loop 
telegr ams to specific locations.  
3.9.3  Infill by radio  
3.9.3.1  In level 1 areas it shall be possible to send to the on -board equipment orders to 
establish/terminate a communication session with a radio infill unit.  
3.9.3.2  The orders shall be sent via balise groups  or via Radio Infi ll units . 
3.9.3.3  The order to establish a communication session shall be ignored:  
a) Intentionally deleted .  
b) If the on -board equipment does not include radio.  
3.9.3.4  If the on -board equipment includes radio, the communication session shall be 
established using the same pr otocols and interfaces as for Level 2/3 operations.

 3.9.3.5  If the order to establish a communication session with a radio infill unit sent via balise 
groups is received by an on -board equipment, connected with another radio infill 
unit(s), two cases may arise:  
3.9.3.5.1  Case 1: the on -board can handle only one communication session at a time. In this 
case, the onboard shall (unless §3.9.3.5.1.1 applies):  
a) terminate the existing communication session at the location indicated in the order  
b) establish a communication session wi th the RIU indicated in the order as soon as 
action a) is completed.  
3.9.3.5.1.1  The order shall be ignored in case it refers to an RIU with which a session is currently 
being established or is already established.  
3.9.3.5.2  Case 2: the on -board can handle more than one communi cation session at a time. In 
this case, at the location indicated in the order the on -board shall:  
a) terminate any communication session existing with RIU(s) not indicated in the order  
b) as soon as a new communication session can be handled, establish a 
commun ication session with the RIU indicated in the order, unless currently being 
established or already established with the said RIU.  
3.9.3.6  If the order to establish a communication session with a radio infill unit sent via Radio 
Infill unit is received by an on -board equipment:  
a) If the on -board can handle only one communication session, the order shall be 
ignored.  
b) If the on -board can handle two communication sessions simultaneously  and only 
one session is ongoing , the existing communication session shall be maintaine d

a) Location where to perform the action (referred to the balise group containing the 
order). Note: if the action is to establish a communication session, this location 
marks the beginning of the Radio Infill Area.

 3.9.3.8.1  The order to establish/terminate a communication session sent via Radio Infill units 
(see 3.5.3.6) shall not be sent together with any radio infill area information.  
3.9.3.9  The establishment of a communication session for radio infill shall not change the 
operational level of the on -board i.e. the information in the balise grou p shall be taken 
into account as usual in level 1.  
3.9.3.10  The on -board equipment shall inform the radio infill unit  
a) As soon as the location indicated in the order sent via balise groups is passed (i.e. 
entry of the train in the infill area)  
b) As soon as the next m ain signal balise group indicated in the order sent via balise 
groups is read or the on -board equipment detects that it was missed.  
3.9.3.11  The information sent to the radio infill unit by the on -board equipment shall include  
a) Train identity (ETCS -ID of the on -board equipment)  
b) Position report  
c) Identifier of the next main signal balise group  
d) Time stamp  
3.9.3.11.1  Justification:  
a) The train identity is used for conformity with other train to track messages  
b) The identifier of the next main signal balise group allows the radio infil l unit to 
identify safely where the train is going, even in the case of a points area  
3.9.3.12  As soon as the radio infill unit is informed that a train has entered an infill area  under  
its responsibility , it shall  
a) Terminate a possible previous sending of infill in formation to the on -board 
equipment , AND  
b) Send cyclically the infill information corresponding to the message currently sent by 
the next main signal balise group indicated in the information from the on -board 
equipment.  
3.9.3.12.1  Justification: case a) refers to the  possibility that a report from the on -board equipment, 
after having passed the previous main signal, was lost.

 in Euroradio specification. Only emergency messages can be sent as high priority 
data, not their acknowledgement or their revocation.  
3.10.1.1.1  Justification: In case of hazardous events, it is possible to use high priority data in the 
radio connection between  RBC and on -board equipment to get a quick reaction.  
3.10.1.2  An emergency message shall contain an identifier decided by the trackside.  
3.10.1.3  The same identifier shall be used in case the emergency message is repeated.  
3.10.1.3.1  If the on -board receives a new message with the sa me identifier it shall replace the 
previous one.  
3.10.1.4  Each emergency message to an on -board equipment shall be acknowledged, using 
the corresponding emergency message identification number.  
3.10.1.4.1  Note: This acknowledgement informs the RBC about the use of the emergen cy 
message by on -board equipment and is independent from the general 
acknowledgement for track -to-train messages, as  specified in section 3.16.3.5.  
3.10.2  Emergency Stop  
3.10.2.1  It shall be possible to stop a train with a conditional or an unconditional emergency 
stop m essage.  
3.10.2.2  A conditional emergency stop message shall contain the information of a new stop 
location, referred to the LRBG.  In case, when receiving this message  
 the train has already passed with its min safe front end the new stop location, the 
emergency sto p message shall be rejected and the RBC shall be informed.  
 the train has not yet passed with its min safe front end the new stop location, the 
emergency stop message shall be accepted, however this location shall be used by 
the onboard to define the new EOA and SvL only if not beyond the current E OA. 
Refer to appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of location based information stored 
on-board, which shall be deleted accordingly . 
3.10.2.3  When receiving an unconditional emergency stop message the train shall be tripp ed 
immediately.  
3.10.2.4  New movement authority received after any accepted emergency stop message and 
before the emergency message has been revoked, shall be rejected .

3.11 Static Speed Restrictions and Gradients  
3.11.1  Introduction  
3.11.1.1  The permitted speed at which the train is allowed to travel shall be limited to different 
kinds of Static Speed Restrictions and considering the End of Authority/Limit Of 
Authority.  
3.11.1.2  A Static Speed Restriction shall be handled in the same way i ndependent of ETCS 
level.  
3.11.2  Definition of Static Speed Restriction  
3.11.2.1  Static Speed Restrictions are imposed by the trackside infrastructure, the train 
characteristics, the signalling and the mode of the on -board equipment.  
3.11.2.2  There are eleven  categories of Static Speed Restrictions:   
a) Static Speed Profile (SSP)  
b) Axle load Speed Profile (ASP)  
c) Temporary Speed Restrictions (TSR)  
d) Maximum Train Speed  
e) Signalling related speed restriction (only level 1)  
f) Mode related Speed Restriction.  
g) STM Max speed (for details refer to Su bset-035) 
h) STM System speed (for details refer to Subset -035) 
i) Level Crossing  speed restriction  (LX SR)  
j) Override function related Speed Restriction

3.11.3  Static Speed Profile (SSP)  
3.11.3.1.1  The Static Speed Profile (SSP) is a description of the fixed speed restrictions of a 
given piece of track. The speed restrictions can be relate d to e.g. maximum line speed, 
curves, points, tunnel profiles, bridges.  
3.11.3.1.2  The Static Speed Profile is based on factors, which are both track and train dependent. 
The relationship between track and train characteristics determine s the individual 
Static Speed Profile for each train.  
3.11.3.1.3  It shall be possible for every element (distance between two discontinuities) of a static 
speed profile to define, if a transition to a higher speed limit than the speed limit 
specified for this element is permitted before the comp lete train has left the element.

 3.11.3.2.1  It shall be possible to transmit  several  Static Speed Profile Categories; one Basic SSP 
category and specific SSP categories related to the international train categories.  
3.11.3.2.1.1  The specific SSP ca tegories are decomposed into two types:  
a) The “Cant Deficiency” SSP categories: the cant deficiency value assigned to one 
category shall define the maximum speed, determined by suspension design, at 
which a particular train can traverse a curve and thus can be used to set a specific 
speed limit in a curve with regards to this category.  
b) The “other specific” SSP categories: it groups all other specific SSP categories 
corresponding to the other international train categories  
3.11.3.2.1.2  Whenever the type of specific SSP cat egory is not explicitly specified in the 
following requirements, it shall be interpreted as being applicable for both types of 
specific SSP categories.  
3.11.3.2.2  For each part of the Static Speed Profile, the ERTMS/ETCS trackside shall:  
a) always give the Basic SSP, wh ich shall be considered as the default “Cant 
Deficiency” SSP  
b) optionally give one or more specific SSPs  
c) specify, for each “other specific” SSP, whether it replaces or not the “Cant 
Deficiency” SSP as selected by the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment according t o 
3.11.3.2.3  
3.11.3.2.3  For each part of the Static Speed Profile, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall 
select the SSP best suiting its “Cant Deficiency” train category, according to the 
following order of preference:  
a) if available, the “Cant Deficiency” SSP matchi ng its “Cant Deficiency” train category, 
OR 
b) if available, the “Cant Deficiency” SSP with the highest Cant Deficiency value below 
the value of its “Cant Deficiency” train category, OR

train belonging to at least one or more “other international” train categories shall use 
the most restr ictive speed amongst:  
a) the ” Cant Deficiency” SSP as selected in 3.11.3.2.3, only if none of the “other 
specific” SSP categories matching the train categories replaces the ” Cant 
Deficiency” SSP, AND

3.11.3.3  Train categories  
3.11.3.3.1  A maximum of 31 train categories shall be defined to match the SSP categories. 16 
“Cant Deficiency”  train categor ies and 15 “other international”  train categories.  
3.11.3.3.2  A train shall always belong to one and only one “Cant Deficiency”  train category  and 
may optionally belong to one or more “other international” train categor ies. 
3.11.3.3.3  The train categor y(ies) to which a train belongs shall be a part of its Train Data.  
3.11.4  Axle load Speed Profile  
3.11.4.1  It shall be possible to d efine an Axle load Speed Profile as a non -continuous profile.  
3.11.4.2  For each section with a speed restriction due to axle load, the different speed value(s) 
and for which minimum axle load category this speed value(s) applies shall be 
specified.  
3.11.4.2.1  Note: Different speed restrictions depending on the axle load category  can be 
applicable to the same distance.  
3.11.4.3  The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment  shall consider the most restrictive speed 
restriction that is associated with any axle load category  lower  than, or equal to th at of 
the train.  
3.11.4.4  For t rains with an axle load category lower than the minimum axle load category given 
in the profile , the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment  shall not consider any speed 
restriction due to axle load.  
3.11.4.5  The initial state for Axle load Speed Profil e shall be “no restriction due to axle load”.  
3.11.4.6  Whether a speed increase after the axle load speed restriction shall be delayed with 
train length, shall be determined by the axle load speed profile information sent to the 
on-board equipment.  
3.11.5  Temporary Speed Restrictions  
3.11.5.1  The temporary speed restriction is defined in order to enable a separate category of 
track infrastructure speed restriction, which can be used for working areas etc.  
3.11.5.2  All Temporary Speed Restrictions shall be independent of each other. This mea ns that 
an individual Temporary Speed Restriction shall not affect, nor be affected by, any 
other individual Temporary Speed Restriction.  
3.11.5.3  Whether a speed increase after the temporary speed restriction shall be delayed with 
train length, shall be determine d by the temporary speed restriction information sent to 
the on -board equipment.

 3.11.5.4  When two or more temporary speed restrictions overlap, the most restrictive speed of 
the overlapping temporary speed restrictions shall be used in the area of overlap.  
3.11.5.5  Each Te mporary Speed Restriction shall have an identity to make it possible to revoke 
the Temporary Speed Restriction using its identity. The speed restriction shall be 
revoked immediately when revocation is received from trackside, without delay for the 
train le ngth.  
3.11.5.6  It shall be possible to identify whether a Temporary Speed Restriction is possible to 
revoke or not.  
3.11.5.7  A new Temporary Speed Restriction shall not replace a previously received Temporary 
Speed Restriction with another identity.  
3.11.5.8  Temporary Speed Restric tions shall only be revoked on request from the trackside.  
3.11.5.9  If the on -board equipment receives a new Temporary Speed Restriction (TSR) with the 
same identity as an already received TSR, the new Temporary Speed Restriction shall 
replace the previous one, ex cept when the Temporary Speed Restriction is identified 
as non revocable in which case this shall be considered as an additional TSR.

3.11.5.12  It shall be possible for the RBC to order an ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment in Level 
2 or 3 to reject revocable TSRs from balises.  
3.11.5.13  When ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment has accepted an order to re ject revocable 
TSRs from balises, this inhibition shall be stored and shall be effective immediately, 
but only for revocable TSRs received from balises thereafter.  
3.11.5.14  The inhibition of revocable TSRs from balises  shall be deleted if any of the following 
occu rs: 
 the communication session established with the RBC that ordered the inhibition is 
terminated, OR  
 in case of RBC/RBC handover, the train front end crosses the RBC/RBC border.  
3.11.5.15  Note: this inhibition may be useful in Level 1 / Level 2 mixed signalling appl ications 
when the RBC has more precise information about restrictions than can be given from

instead send more precise TSRs to the train.

 3.11.6.2  This speed value shall be taken into account by the on -board equipment as soon as it 
is received on -board, with the exception of a signalling related speed restriction from 
an infill device. In case of infill information the speed restriction shall be taken into 
account from the location reference of the balise group at the next main signal.  
3.11.6.3  The speed restriction sh all be valid until a new signalling related speed restriction is

3.11.6.3.1  If the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment switches from level 1 to level 2 /3, the 
signalling related speed restriction shall remain valid until a L2 /3 MA is accepted by the 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment  
3.11.6.4  In case of a signal at danger the signalling related speed restriction shall have value  
zero, which shall be evaluated by the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment not as a 
speed limit but as a train trip order.

3.11.10.1  While the “ov erride” function is active, the override speed limit (national /default value) 
shall be taken into account.  
3.11.11  Speed restriction  to ensure permitted braking distance  
3.11.11.1  It shall be possible for trackside to request the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment to 
calculate a speed restriction based on a permitted braking distance  given by trackside . 
3.11.11.2  The order shall be given by means of a non -continuous profile defining:  
 The start and end location for the speed restriction  
 The permitted braking distance (PBD) used to calculat e the speed restriction value  
 Whether the permitted braking distance is to be achieved with the Service Brake or 
Emergency Brake  
 A single gradient value applicable for the calculation  
3.11.11.3  The speed restriction shall be calculated when the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment 
receives the permitted braking distance information from trackside, and shall be re -
calculated only if any of the inputs taken into account for the calculation of the speed 
restriction changes.  
3.11.11.4  The calculation of the speed restriction by the ERTMS /ETCS on-board equipment shall 
take into account that : 
 The single gradient value received from trackside shall be compensated in value 
according to the rotating mass as defined in 3.13.4.3 . 
 The safe deceleration shall be computed as in 3.13.6.2.1 but witho ut considering 
the adhesion profiles , the track conditions related to brake inhibition and the track 
conditions related to powerless section given by trackside.  
 The expected deceleration shall be computed as in 3.13.6.3.1 but without 
considering the track conditions related to brake inhibition and the track conditions 
related to powerless section given by trackside . 
 The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall calculate an Emergency Brake 
Deceleration (EBD) curve based on the safe deceleration and that reaches z ero 
speed at a distance equal to the permitted braking distance . 
 If the permitted braking distance is to be achieved with the service brake, the 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall also calculate a Service Brake 
Deceleration (SBD) curve based on the expect ed deceleration and that reaches 
zero speed at a distance equal to the permitted braking distance . 
 The estimated acceleration shall be set to “zero”.  
 If not inhibited by National Value, the compensation of the inaccuracy of the speed 
measurement shall be s et to a value calculated from the PBD speed, as defined in 
SUBSET -041 § 5.3.1.2: V_delta0PBD = f41(V_PBD + dV_EBI(V_PBD)) if the

 permitted braking distance is to be achieved with the emergency brake; 
V_delta0PBD = f41(V_PBD + dV_SBI(V_PBD))  if the permitte d braking distance is 
to be achieved with the service brake . 
 The train will travel a distance from the last encountered balise of a group that 
provides restrictive information until initiating the brake command. This travelled 
distance shall be set to a va lue calculated from the PBD speed considering a 
processing delay (T 41) equal to SUBSET -041 § 5.2.1.1.  
 Regardless of how the service brake feedback is actually configured (see 
3.13.2.2.7.2), T_bs1 and T_bs2 (see 3.13.9.3.3) shall be defined as if the servic e 
brake feedback was not implemented . 
 Regardless of how the traction cut -off interface is actually configured (see 
3.13.2.2.8), T_traction (see 3.13.9.3.2) shall be defined as if the traction cut -off was 
not implemented.  
3.11.11.4.1  Note: Knowing how the PBD speed res triction is computed by the ERTMS/ETCS on -
board equipment, it is the responsibility of the trackside to set the appropriate 
permitted braking distance with regard to the risk of not initiating the brake command 
in due time when encountering a further balis e group providing restrictive information. 
In other words, if deemed necessary, the trackside can include provisions based on 
the characteristics of the balise group providing restrictive information e.g. distances 
between balises in that group with regard s to validity direction of transmitted 
information and balise group orientation, accuracy of balise location.  
3.11.11.4.2  Note: If the permitted braking distance is to be achieved with the service brake , it is the 
responsibility of the trackside to also consider an es timation of the on-board over-
reading and under -reading amounts at the time the brake command is initiated in order 
to lower the likelihood of the max safe front end of the train reaching the EBI

 3.13 Speed and distance monitoring  
3.13.1  Introduction  
3.13.1.1  The speed and distance monitoring is the supervision of the speed of the train versus 
its position, in order to assure that the train remains within the given speed and 
distance limits.  
3.13.1.1.1  Note: The speed and distance monitorin g of the on -board can only assure this when 
the following necessary conditions are fulfilled:  
 Brake system of the train functions as specified  
 wheel/rail adhesion is sufficient for the required safe deceleration  
 Brake characteristics (and other Train Data)  are correctly entered into the on -board 
(automatic or by driver)  
3.13.1.2  Note: The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment triggers brake commands and revokes 
them, it may also receive status information if the brakes are applied or released. 
However, it cannot be made res ponsible if brake control circuits outside the equipment 
fail. Also the way the brakes are released by the driver after a revocation of a brake 
command is an implementation issue.  
3.13.1.3  Figure 28 gives an overview of the main elements c ontributing to the speed and 
distance monitoring. These elements (inputs, functions and outputs) are detailed in the 
following chapters.

3.13.2  Inputs for speed and distance monitoring  
3.13.2.1  Introduction  
3.13.2.1.1  The traction / braking models, the brake position / brake percentage are used for the 
definition of the kinematic behaviour of the train after a service brake command or an 
emergency brake command has been initiated.

 3.13.2.1.2  However, railway brakes hav e a statistical behaviour and braking distances vary within 
the typical distribution for a given condition. Correction factors are therefore 
incorporated for the speed and distance monitoring.  
3.13.2.1.3  The correction factors will allow obtaining, from the nominal emergency braking 
performance of the train, the minimum emergency braking performances that are 
required  for reference conditions set by trackside . 
3.13.2.2  Train related inputs  
3.13.2.2.1  Introduction  
3.13.2.2.1.1  The train related inputs to be considered for the speed and distance monito ring are:  
a) Traction model  
b) Braking models (brake build up time and speed dependent deceleration) or brake 
percentage  
c) Brake position  
d) Special brakes  
e) Service brake interface  
f) Traction cut -off interface  
g) On-board correction factors  
h) Nominal rotating mass  
i) Train leng th 
j) Fixed values related to speed and distance monitoring  
k)  Train related speed restriction (i.e. the maximum train speed)  
3.13.2.2.1.2  All train related inputs except the fixed values are acquired as Train Data (see 
3.18.3.2 items b) c) and d)).  
3.13.2.2.1.3  The speed and distance m onitoring shall use braking models acquired as Train 
Data, unless the brake percentage is acquired as Train Data and the conversion model 
is applicable (see 3.13.3.2 for its validity limits) . 
3.13.2.2.2  Traction model  
3.13.2.2.2.1  The traction model shall be given as a step funct ion as indicated in Figure 29. It 
shall describe the time delay T_traction_cut_off from the traction cut -off command by 
the on -board (t0) to the moment the acceleration due to traction (A_traction) is 
guaranteed to  be zero (t1). The estimated acceleration value of the train shall be 
considered during this time delay.

3.13.2.2.3  Braking Models  
3.13.2.2.3.1  Speed Dependent Deceleration  
3.13.2.2.3.1.1  The deceleration due to braking shall be given as a step function of the speed.  
3.13.2.2.3.1.2  It shal l be possible to define up to seven steps for each speed dependent 
deceleration model.  
3.13.2.2.3.1.3  Note: An example with 4 steps is given in Figure 30. A_brake(V) is calculated as 
follows:  
 A_brake = AD_0  when 0 ≤ speed ≤ V1  
 A_brake = AD_1  when V1 < speed ≤ V2

 3.13.2.2.3.1.4  The last step o f A_brake(V)  shall by definition be considered as open ended, i.e. it 
has no upper speed limit.  
3.13.2.2.3.1.5  The model shall be applicable only after full build up of the braking effort (see a_full 
in Figure 31) 
3.13.2.2.3.1.6  The model shall be used for the  emergency brake nominal deceleration 
(A_brake_emergency(V)), for the full service brake deceleration (A_brake_service(V)) 
and for the normal service brake deceleration (A_brake_normal_service(V)).  
3.13.2.2.3.1.7  It shall be possible to define individual speed dependent deceleration models of 
A_brake_emergency(V) and A_brake_service(V)  for each combination of use of 
regenerative brake, eddy current brake and magnetic shoe brake.  
3.13.2.2.3.1.8  Note: Individual deceleration models may be equal, thereby avoiding the influence 
of a specifi c brake on A_brake_emergency(V) or A_brake_service(V). However, the 
choice to take into account or not the contribution of a specific brake for 
A_brake_emergency(V) or A_brake_service(V) is only rolling stock dependent, not an 
ETCS implementation issue.  
3.13.2.2.3.1.9  It shall be possible to define up to two sets of three models of 
A_brake_normal_service(V):  
a) one set applicable when the brake position is in “Freight train in G”  
b) one set applicable when the brake position is in “Passenger train in P” or “Freight 
train in P”  
3.13.2.2.3.1.10  A set of A_brake_normal_service(V) shall be defined as a function of the full 
service brake deceleration at zero speed, A_brake_service(V=0):  
If A_brake_service(V = 0)  A_SB01  
A_brake_normal_service(V) = A_brake_normal_service_0(V)  
if A_SB01 < A_brake_ser vice(V = 0)  A_SB12  
A_brake_normal_service(V) = A_brake_normal_service_1(V)  
if A_SB12 < A_brake_service (V = 0)  
A_brake_normal_service(V) = A_brake_normal_service_2(V)  
3.13.2.2.3.1.11  Note: the two pivot values A_SB01 and A_SB12 are part of the 
A_brake_normal_service mod el, i.e. they are train related input data for the speed and 
distance monitoring function.

 3.13.2.2.3.2.1  The deceleration A_brake is not available immediately after the on -board 
commands the brake. There is a time lag between brake command and the st art of the 
brake force build -up. There is also time needed to build up the full brake force.  
3.13.2.2.3.2.2  The model for the brake build up time shall be given as a step function as explained 
in Figure 31.

Figure 31: Brake Build Up Time Model  
3.13.2.2.3.2.3  In Figure 31, the following time intervals are defined:  
a) T_brake_react (t0…t1) is the interval between the command of the brake by the on -
board and the moment the brake force star ts to build up.  
b) T_brake_increase (t1...t2) is the interval in which the brake force increases from the 
zero to the moment when 95% of full brake power is reached.  
c) T_brake_build_up (t0...t3) is the equivalent brake build up time.  
3.13.2.2.3.2.4  The equivalent brake build up time (T_brake_build_up) is defined as 
T_brake_build_up = T_brake_react + 0.5*T_brake_increase.  
3.13.2.2.3.2.5  This model for T_brake_build_up shall be used for the emergency brake 
(T_brake_emergency) and for the full service brake (T_brake_service).  
3.13.2.2.3.2.6  Note: The equivale nt brake build up time is a safe approximation. In the beginning 
of the build -up time the model assumes a smaller deceleration, in the later part this is 
compensated by a higher deceleration.  
3.13.2.2.3.2.7  Note: T_brake_react and T_brake_increase are indicated in Figure 31 for 
completeness reasons; only T_brake_build_up is to be considered as an input for the 
speed and distance monitoring function.  
3.13.2.2.3.2.8  It shall be possible to define individual values of T_brake_emergency and 
T_brake_service for each  combination of use of regenerative brake, eddy current 
brake, magnetic shoe brake and  Ep brake .

 3.13.2.2.3.2.9  Note: Individual values of T_brake_emergency and T_brake_service may be equal, 
thereby avoiding the influence of a specific brake. However, the choice to take into 
account or not the contribution of a specific brake for T_brake_emergency and 
T_brake_service is only rolling stock dependent, not an ETCS implementation issue.  
3.13.2.2.3.2.10  Note: In general, T_brake_emergency and T_brake_service are determined by 
the pneumatic br ake therefore avoiding to take into account of the influence of the 
regenerative brake, eddy current brake or magnetic shoe brake. However, if the 
Electro -pneumatic brake system is used, it is possible that T_brake_emergency and 
T_brake_service are determi ned by another special brake.  
3.13.2.2.4  Brake Position  
3.13.2.2.4.1  The brake position shall be set to one of the following three values:  
a) Passenger train in P  
b) Freight train in P  
c) Freight train in G  
3.13.2.2.4.2  Note: The brake position defines the behaviour of the brake for specific train typ es. 
3.13.2.2.5  Brake Percentage  
3.13.2.2.5.1  If the brake percentage is captured as Train Data and the conversion model is 
applicable (see  3.13.3.2 ), they are used to derive A_brake _emergency (V), 
A_brake_service(V), T_brake_emergency and T_brake_ servi ce. 
3.13.2.2.5.2  Note: the conversion model has been designed assuming that all the provisions laid 
down in the UIC leaflet 544 -1, with the exception of sections 9.1.2 and 9.2.2, apply for 
the acquired brake percentage .

applicable, A_brake_emergency(V), T_brake_emergency and A_brake_service(V) 
shall not be influenced by the status of a special brake. However, the conversion 
model offers the possib ility that T_brake _service can be affected by the status of the 
regenerative brake, eddy current brake o r Ep brake (see A.3.9) . 
3.13.2.2.6.4  The on -board equipment shall be configured to define whether it is allowed to take 
into account the contribution of a special/ad ditional brake, which is independent from 
wheel/rail adhesion, for the selection of the maximum emergency brake deceleration 
under reduced adhesion conditions (see 3.13.6.2.1.6 ). 
3.13.2.2.6.5  Note: the choice to set to “allo wed” the contribution of such special/additional brake 
in the selection of the maximum emergency braking effort, is rolling stock dependent.  
3.13.2.2.6.6  If it is allowed to take into account the contribution of a special/additional brake, 
which is independent from whe el/rail adhesion, the speed and monitoring function shall 
take into account the status “active” or “not active” of the special/additional brake to 
select the appropriate National Value under reduced adhesion conditions (see 
3.13.2.3.7.7 ). 
3.13.2.2.7  Service brake interface  
3.13.2.2.7.1  The on -board shall be configured to define whether the service brake command is 
implemented or not, i.e. whether a service brake interface is implemented to command 
a full service brake effort.  
3.13.2.2.7.2  The on -board shall be conf igured to define whether the service brake feedback is 
implemented or not, i.e. whether it is able to acquire from the service brake interface 
the information that the service brake is currently  applied (e.g. from the main brake 
pipe pressure or brake cyli nder pressure).  
3.13.2.2.8  Traction cut -off interface  
3.13.2.2.8.1  The on -board shall be configured to define whether the traction cut -off command is 
implemented, i.e. whether the interface to the traction system is implemented or not.

3.13.2.2.9.1.1  If the braking models are captured as Train Data, rolling stock correction factors 
shall be defined in the ETCS on -board equipment. If the brake percentage is captured 
as Train Data and the conversion model is used (see 3. 13.3.2 for its validity limits), no 
rolling stock correction factor shall apply.

3.13.2.2.9.1.3  For a given confidence level on emergency brake safe deceleration (EBCL), the 
rolling stock correction fact or Kdry_rst(V) shall be given as a step function of speed, 
with the same steps as the ones of A_brake_emergency(V).  
3.13.2.2.9.1.4  The confidence level on emergency brake safe deceleration represents the 
probability of the following individual event: the rolling stock em ergency brake 
subsystem of the train does ensure a deceleration at least equal to 
A_brake_emergency(V) * Kdry_rst(V), when the emergency brake is commanded on 
dry rails.  
3.13.2.2.9.1.5  The rolling stock correction factor Kwet_rst(V) shall be given as a step function of 
speed, with the same steps as the ones of A_brake_emergency(V). It represents the 
loss of deceleration with regards to emergency braking on dry rails, when the 
emergency brake is commanded on wet rails, according to wheel/rail adhesion 
reference conditions.  
3.13.2.2.9.2  Correction factor for gradient on normal service deceleration  
3.13.2.2.9.2.1  The speed dependent correction factors for gradient on the normal service brake,

 3.13.2.3.7.13  The last step of the Kv_int(V) and Kr_int(l) shall by definition be considered as open 
ended, i.e. it has no upper speed and train length limit , respectively . 
3.13.2.3.7.14  The correction factor for brake bu ild up time (Kt_int) shall be a single parameter.  
3.13.3  Conversion Models  
3.13.3.1  Introduction  
3.13.3.1.1  For trains with variable composition (loco hauled trains), the brake characteristics can 
vary together with the composition of the train. In this case, it is not convenient to  pre-
program the brake parameters necessary to calculate the braking curves. The only 
practical way to obtain the correct values for the current train composition is to include 
them into the data entry process by the driver. However, it cannot be expected from 
the driver to know deceleration values and brake build up times. Conversion models 
are therefore defined to convert the parameters entered by the driver (brake 
percentage and brake position) into the parameters of the corresponding brake model.  
3.13.3.1.2  Note: The process for defining the input parameters for the conversion model (brake 
percentage and brake position) is outside the scope of the ERTMS/ETCS 
specifications.  
3.13.3.2  Applicability of the conversion models  
3.13.3.2.1  The conversion models shall be used by the on -board e quipment if the brake 
percentage is acquired as part of Train Data, and if the maximum train speed, the 
brake percentage and the train length are all within the following validity limits of the 
conversion models:  
a) 0 ≤ V ≤ 200, where V is the maximum train speed in km/h  
b) 30 ≤ λ ≤ 250, where λ is the brake percentage in %  
c) 0 ≤ L ≤ Lmax , where L is the train length in m  and where Lmax = 900  m if the brake 
position is “Passenger train in P” or Lmax = 1500  m if the brake p osition is “Freight 
train in P” or “Freight train in G”  
3.13.3.2.1.1  Note: The overspeed above the maximum train speed which may occur due to the 
ceiling speed margins is taken into account in the definition of the conversion model.  
3.13.3.2.2  For trains not fitting into at least  one of those validity limits, it is still possible to acquire 
the brake percentage as Train Data, but the conversion models are not applicable, 
which means that braking models (i.e. pre -programmed deceleration profiles and 
brake build up times) shall be u sed by the speed and distance monitoring function .

 3.13.4.2.1  Assuming that a fictive train front end would be at any locati on between the current 
(actual) train front end location and the SvL, the acceleration due to the gradient shall 
be determined using the lowest (taking the sign into account) gradient value given by 
the gradient profile between the location of the fictive train front end and the location of 
the fictive train rear end (see Figure 35). 
3.13.4.3  Rotating mass  
3.13.4.3.1  The influence of gradients shall be compensated for the rotating mass of the train (see 
Figure 35). 
3.13.4.3.1.1  Note: Sinc e the rotating mass works like a flywheel (rotating inertia), the effect of 
the gradient is reduced. Assume for instance a (theoretical) train without any rotating 
mass, not braking, on a downhill gradient from height 1 to height 2. All the energy 
added to  the train when it goes from H1 to H2 is converted into linear forward motion. 
This can be observed as an acceleration due to the gradient. Now assume the same 
train with part of the weight rotating. If this train travels the same distance from H1 to 
H2, t he same amount of energy is added to the train. But now a part of that energy is 
converted into rotational motion and only the remaining part is converted into linear 
forward motion. The latter can be observed as an acceleration which is less than for 
the train without rotating mass.  
3.13.4.3.1.2  Note: For the influence of the rotating mass on the deceleration due to the brake, it 
is already taken into account in the values for the brake parameters.  
3.13.4.3.2  The following formulas shall be used:  
a) If M_rotating_nom is unknown:  
 Uphill: A_gradient = g * grad / (1000+10*M_rotating_max)  
 Downhill: A_gradient = g * grad / (1000+10*M_rotating_min)  
b) If M_rotating_nom is known:  
 Uphill: A_gradient = g * grad / (1000+10*M_rotating_nom)  
 Downhill: A_gradient = g * grad / (1000+10*M_rotating_nom)  
Legend:  
A_gradient = acceleration/deceleration due to gradient  
g = 9.8 1 m/s2 - acceleration of gravity  in m/s2 
grad = gradient values in ‰ (positive = uphill)  
M_rotating_nom = nominal rotating mass (part of train data) as a percentage of the 
total train w eight  
M_rotating_max = maximum possible rotating mass (see A3.1) as a percentage of the 
total train weight  
M_rotating_min = minimum possible rotating mass (see A3.1) as a percentage of the 
total train weight

 3.13.5  Determination of locations with out special  brake  contribu tion and with 
reduced adhesion conditions  
3.13.5.1  As long as  it uses a  track condition profile given by trackside, the on -board shall 
consider locations with out special  brake contribu tion over a distance going from the 
start location of the profile to the  foot of the deceleration c urve (EBD, SBD or GUI, see 
section s 3.13.8.3 , 3.13.8.4  and 3.13.8.5 ). 
3.13.5.2  If the status of a special brake is “not active”, all locations shall be  considered without 
the contribution of this special brake.  
3.13.5.2.1  Note: in such case, a track condition profile implying the inhibition of this special brake 
will have no effect.  
3.13.5.3  From the adhesion profile given by trackside, the on -board shall consider locations  with 
reduced adhesion conditions over a distance going from the start location of the profile 
to the location derived by adding the train length to the end location of the profile.  
3.13.5.4  When slippery rail is selected by the driver, all locations shall be consi dered with 
reduced adhesion conditions.  
3.13.5.5  The speed and distance monitoring shall use, as resulting reduced adhesion 
conditions, the most restrictive value of the adhesion conditions selected by the driver 
and the adhesion conditions calculated from the trac kside profile.

the full service brake:  
T_bs = T_brake_service , with T_brake_service corresponding to the combination of 
special brake s currently in use  
3.13.6.4  Normal service brake deceleration  
3.13.6.4.1  Since the normal service brake deceleration is not safety relevant, no worst case 
conditions (e.g. correction factors, adhesion conditions) need to be taken into account 
for its calculation.  
3.13.6.4.2  The train and track related characteristics to be considered are:  
a) The speed dependent deceleration model(s) for the full service brake either 
acquired as part of Train Data (see 3.13.2.2.3.1 ) or derived from the brake 
percentage using the conversion model (see 3.13.3.3 ) 
b) The speed dependent deceleration model(s) for the normal service brake acquired 
as part of Train Data (see 3.13.2.2 .3.1) 
c) The acceleration/deceleration due to gradient  i.e. A_gradient(d) (see 3.13.4 ) 
d) The brake position (see  3.13.2.2.4 ) 
e) The on -board correction factors Kn+(V) and Kn -(V) (see 3.13.2.2.9.2 ) 
f) The locations with out special  brake contribu tion (see 3.13.5 ) 
3.13.6.4.3  The normal service brake deceleration shall be equal to:

 For positive gradient values (uphill):  
A_normal_service(V,d) = A_brake_normal_service(V,d) + A_gradient(d) – Kn+(V)*grad  
For negative gradi ent values (downhill):  
A_normal_service(V,d) = A_brake_normal_service(V,d) + A_gradient(d) – Kn-(V)*grad  
Where  
grad = gradient values in ‰ (positive = uphill)  
3.13.6.4.4  A_brake_normal_service(V,d) shall be the normal deceleration of the service brake as 
a function o f the speed, of the locations with change of special brake(s) contribution  
encountered between the train front and the foot of the GUI curve . 
A_brake_normal_service(V,d) shall be equal to:

3.13.7  Determination of Most Restrictive Speed Profile (MRSP)  
3.13.7.1  The Mo st Restrictive Speed Profile (MRSP) is a description of the most restrictive 
speed restrictions the train shall obey on a given piece of track.  
3.13.7.2  The Most Restrictive Speed Profile shall be computed from all speed restrictions (see 
3.13.2.2.13  & 3.13.2.3.2 ) by selecting the most restrictive parts of each element, some 
elements being compensated by the train length if requested by trackside (see 
3.11.3.1.3  for SSP, 3.11.4.6  for ASP and 3.11.5.3  for TSR) .

3.13.8  Determination of targets and brake deceleration curves  
3.13.8.1  Introduction  
3.13.8.1.1  A target is defined by a target location and a target speed, to which the train must 
decelerate before reaching the target location.  
3.13.8.1.2  For that  purpose, the on -board equipment shall use brake deceleration curves related 
to the supervised targets, from the deceleration values as specified in sections 
3.13.6.2.1 , 3.13.6.3.1 and 3.13.6.4 . 
3.13.8.1.3  These deceleration values being speed and distance dependent, a brake deceleration 
curve shall be calculated piecewise, i.e. it shall be composed of interconnected arcs of 
parabola, ea ch one being based on one of the speed/distance dependent deceleration 
values  (see Figure 38). 
3.13.8.2  Determination of the supervised targets  
3.13.8.2.1  The on -board shall continuously supervise a list of targets, which may include the 
following ty pes of target:  
a) the locations corresponding to a speed decrease of the MRSP (if any), which are in 
advance of the max safe front end of the train  
b) the Limit of Authority (LOA), if the target speed at the EOA/LOA is not equal to zero  
c) the End of Authority (EOA ) and the Supervised Location (SvL), if the target speed at 
the EOA is equal to zero  
d) the location deduced from the maximum permitted distance to run in Staff 
Responsible, with a target speed zero  
3.13.8.2.1.1  Note: depending on the information received from trackside a nd the position of the 
train, the list of supervised targets may be empty.  
3.13.8.2.2  The list of supervised targets shall be re -evaluated when any of the elements it is built 
of is changed (e.g. new MA and/or track description accepted on -board, EOA and/or 
SvL tempo rarily supervised at the start location of a mode profile, update of stored 
information in specific situations (see sections A.3.4 and 4.10)).  
3.13.8.2.3  A target corresponding to a speed decrease of the MRSP shall be removed from the 
list of supervised targets when the max safe front end of the train has passed the 
target location.

 3.13.8.3.1  If a target belongs to the MRSP or is an LOA, the on -board shall calculate an EBD 
curve based on the safe deceleration A_safe(V,d) , that crosses t he ceiling speed EBI 
supervision limit (see 3.13.9.2 ) at the target location , and that extends up to the 
location where the target speed is reached (EBD foot) .

3.13.8.5.1  The purpose of the guidance curve (GUI) is to provide a comfortable way of braking for 
the driver, to avoid excessive wear of the brakes and to save traction energy.  
3.13.8.5.2  If the National Value does not inhibit them, the on -board shall calculate a guidance 
curve (GUI) for each supervised target, based on the normal service brake 
deceleration A_normal_service(V,d). The foot of a GUI curve (i.e. the location where 
the GUI speed is equal to the target speed) shall be:  
a) the target location, in case of EOA/SvL  
b) the location defined in 3.13.9.3.5.9 , for others targets  
3.13.9  Supervision limits  
3.13.9.1  Overview  
3.13.9.1.1  In this chapter the following supervision limits are defined:  
 Emergency brake intervention (EBI)  
 Service brake intervention (SBI)  
 Warn ing (W)  
 Permitted speed (P)

  Indication (I)  
 Pre-Indication location  
 Release speed monitoring start location  
3.13.9.1.2  The purpose of the emergency brake intervention supervision limit is to assure that the 
train will remain within the various limits (in distance/spee d) imposed by the trackside.  
3.13.9.1.3  The purpose of all other supervision limits is to assist the driver in preventing an 
emergency brake intervention by maintaining the speed of the train within the 
appropriate limits.  
3.13.9.2  Ceiling supervision limits  
3.13.9.2.1  The ceiling super vision limits are derived from the MRSP elements, where the speed is 
constant (refer to 3.13.7 ) or from the LOA.  
3.13.9.2.2  From an MRSP element or from the LOA, the Permitted speed, Warning, Service 
brake intervention and Emergency brake  intervention supervision limits are defined 
(see Figure 43).

3.13.9.3.1  Overview  
3.13.9.3.1.1  The braking to target supervision limits are derived from the EBD, SBD and GUI 
curves.  
3.13.9.3.1.2  From an EBD curve, the Emergency brake intervention (EBI), Service brake 
intervention (SBI 2), Warning (W), Permitted speed (P) and Indication (I) supervision 
limits, valid for the estimated speed, are defined as follows(see Figure 45):

 speed under reading amount (V_ura)  at the moment when the calculation is made : 
V_delta0 = V_ura  (see Figure 45). 
3.13.9.3.2.2  The time elapsed between the Emergency brake intervention and the full application 
of the braking effort is reached (EBD) shall be split into two parts:  
a) Time during which the traction effort is still present: T_traction  
b) Remaining time during which the traction effort is not present: T_berem  
3.13.9.3.2.3  The traction time (T_Traction) shall be defined as follows:  
a) when the traction cut -off is implemented:  
T_traction = MAX((T_traction_cut_off - (T_warning + T_bs2)) ; 0).  
b) when the tractio n cut -off is not implemented: T_traction = T_traction_cut_off  
3.13.9.3.2.4  Note: When the traction cut -off is implemented, the traction cut -off command is 
triggered when passing the warning limit. The term (T_warning + T_bs2) in the 
equation above takes this into accou nt, assuming that the warning limit is derived from 
the EBD.  
3.13.9.3.2.5  T_bs2 and T_warning are defined in sections 3.13.9.3.3  and 3.13.9.3.4 . 
3.13.9.3.2.6  The remaining time with no traction (T_berem) shall be equal to MA X(T_be - 
T_traction ; 0).  
3.13.9.3.2.7  Note: T_Traction exceeding T_be is rather a theoretical case, but is nevertheless 
included to make the specifications complete.  
3.13.9.3.2.8  During T_traction, the estimated acceleration (A_est1) shall be the one  measured at 
the moment when th e calculation is made, but limited to positive or null values . 
3.13.9.3.2.9  If T_be > T_traction, the estimated acceleration during T_berem (A_est2) shall be 
the one measured at the moment when the calculation is made, but limited to values 
between 0 and +0.4m/s2. 
3.13.9.3.2.10  The compensated speed and the distance travelled during the time elapsed 
between the Emergency brake intervention and the full application of the braking effort 
is reached shall be derived as follows (see Figure 45):

3.13.9.3.3.3  If the service brake command is available for use and the service brake feedback is

3.13.9.3.3.4  If both the service brake command and the service brake feedback are available for 
use, T_bs1 and T_bs2 shall be firstly set to T_bs. When the service brake is used by 
the driver, they shall then  be reduced progressively and possibly locked to the 
respective fixed values of 0s and T_bs2_locked, until the target location is passed or 
until the target speed monitoring is left; they are then reset again to T_bs (see detailed 
algorithm in Appendix A3. 10). 
3.13.9.3.3.4.1  In case T_bs < T_bs2_locked then T_bs2 shall be equal to T_bs2_locked.  
3.13.9.3.3.5  If the service brake command is not available for use, T_bs1 and T_bs2 shall be set

howe ver acceptable and necessary since the error made tends to zero when the train

of target different from EOA/SvL, the location of  the Permitted speed supervision limit,

a) the estimated acceleration shall be set to “zero”  
b) if not inhibited by National Value, the compensation of t he inaccuracy of the speed

 To avoid very low values when T_bs is small, a minimum is defined for T_indication, 
giving the driver always enough time to opera te the brake.  
3.13.9.3.6.4  If the service brake feedback interface is available for use then T_indication = 5s.  
3.13.9.4  Release speed supervision limits  
3.13.9.4.1  The release speed is a special ceiling speed limit, applicable in the vicinity of the EOA. 
The EBI supervision limit shall b e equal to the release speed. There is no SBI, W, P, I 
supervision limit associated to the release speed.  
3.13.9.4.2  Note: The release speed may be necessary for two reasons. One is that a train has to 
be able to approach the EOA where the permitted speed reaches zer o and might be 
too restrictive to permit acceptable driving due to inaccuracy of the measured distance. 
The other reason is that in a level 1 application the train has to be able to overpass the 
balise when the signal clears. For these two reasons a (low) release speed may be 
given from trackside or may be calculated on board, based on the distance from the 
EOA to the Supervised Location.  
3.13.9.4.3  With each MA, it shall be possible for the trackside to:  
a) Give the value of the release speed directly to the on -board, O R 
b) Instruct the on -board to calculate the release speed, OR  
c) Instruct the on -board to use the national value.  
3.13.9.4.4  In case the MA does not identify the variant to be used or in case of LOA, no release 
speed shall be supervised.  
3.13.9.4.5  Note: When the release speed is giv en as a fixed value from trackside, the 
ERTMS/ETCS system cannot be responsible for stopping the train in rear of the 
Supervised Location. In this case, it is the full responsibility of the infrastructure 
manager to set the appropriate release speed with r egard to the risk of passing the 
Supervised Location.  
3.13.9.4.6  The start location of the release speed monitoring (i.e. where the EBI supervision limit 
related to EBD is replaced with an EBI supervision limit equal to the release speed 
value) shall be the location of the most restrictive SB I supervision limit  among the SBI1 
related to EOA, the SBI2 related to SvL  and, when the Release Speed is calculated 
on-board, the SBI2 supervision limit(s) related to other target(s), if any, between the 
Trip location related to the EOA and the SvL,  calculated for the Release Speed value, 
taking into account the following assumptions:  
a) the estimated acceleration shall be set to “zero”  
b) if not inhibited by National Value, the compensation of the inaccuracy of the speed 
measurement sh all be set to a value calculated from the release speed, as defined 
in SUBSET -041 § 5.3.1.2:  V_delta0 rs = f 41(V_release)

3.13.9.4.8.2.1  Note: The above formulas  are intended to prevent the calculated release speed 
from fluctuating, according to the distanc e, speed and acceleration measurements. It 
allows calculating the release speed only once, for a given on-board  reference 
location, unless  
 the distance confidence interval exceeds a predicted one, which is based on 
the assumption that the whole distance be tween the current on -board 
reference location and the EOA would be travelled with SUBSET -041 
odometer performance values  and without any update of the on -board 
reference location, or  
 the speed under reading amount (V_ura) exceeds the SUBSET -041 
performance  value  
Whenever the on-board reference location is updated (e.g. new LRBG), the release 
speed will however be recalculated and will increase with a step. This behaviour is 
acceptable from an operational point of view.  
3.13.9.4.8.2.2  Note: The method chosen (e.g. iterativ e algorithm) to compute the release speed is 
an implementation issue . 
3.13.9.4.9  If the release speed ( Figure 52 box 1 gives an example when it is calculated on -board) 
exceeds the MRSP anywhere in the area ( Figure 52 box 2) delimited on one side by 
the presumed start location of the Release speed monitoring and on the other side by 
the trip location related to the E OA, the on -board shall use as a fixed release speed 
(Figure 52 box 4) the mos t restrictive value of the MRSP ( Figure 52 box 3) within this 
area, and shall re -evaluate the start location of the Release speed monitoring 
accordingly .

3.13.9.5  Pre-indication location  
3.13.9.5.1  The purpose of the pre -indication is to inform the driver that he is approaching an area 
where he has to operate the service brake in order to brake to a target. The pre -
indication is used to switch from ceiling sp eed monitoring to target speed monitoring.  
3.13.9.5.2  For an EBD based target, the on -board shall calculate the pre -indication location as 
follows.  
3.13.9.5.3  Starting from the first element of the MRSP (i.e. from the start location of the on -board 
stored track description), th e on -board shall calculate the location of the Indication 
supervision limit, valid for the speed of the MRSP element, taking into account the 
following assumptions:  
a) the estimated acceleration shall be set to “zero”  
b) if not inhibited by National Value, the compensation of the inaccuracy of the speed 
measurement shall be set to a value, calculated from the speed of the MRSP 
element, as defined in SUBSET -041 § 5.3.1.2: V_ delta0 ind = f 41(V_MRSP -n) 
c) If available for use, the service brake feedback shall not have a ny effect: T_bs1ind 
and T_bs2ind shall be set to T_bs if the service brake command is available for use, 
otherwise they shall be set to “zero”. T_tractionind and T_beremind shall be defined 
as in 3.13.9.3.2 for T_traction and T_berem b y substituting T_bs2 with T_bs2ind  
3.13.9.5.4  To calculate the EBI supervision limit, the same formulas defined above with V_est , 
T_traction, T_berem and V_ delta0  shall be applied, by substituting V_est with 
V_MRSP -n, T_traction with T_tractionind, T_berem with T_beremind  and V_ delta0

3.13.9.5.10  If, in exceptional situation (e.g. after a shortening of MA), the EBD, SBD or GUI speed 
at the start location of the MRSP is lower than the speed of the first element of the 
MRSP, the condition [1]  for executing speed monitoring transition (see Table 16) shall

3.13.9.5.11  Note 1: For ergonomic reasons, the location of a pre -indication is independent of the 
estimated speed. If the pre -indication w ould be derived from an EBD or SBD curve 
according to the estimated speed, then when the train is running at low speed the 
driver would see the permitted speed already decrease while the DMI is still in ceiling 
speed display. That is not consistent for the  driver and therefore the pre -indication is 
independent of the estimated speed.  
3.13.9.5.12  Note 2: For trackside engineering reasons, the assumptions for the calculation of the 
EBI supervision limit are necessary to obtain a fully predictable pre -indication location,  
i.e. independent from the measured acceleration and speed confidence interval.

with the speed as defined by the MRSP without t he need to brake to a target.  
3.13.10.1.4  Target speed monitoring is the speed and distance supervision in the area where the 
specific information related to a target is displayed to the driver and within which the 
train brakes to a target.  
3.13.10.1.5  Release speed monitoring is  the speed and distance supervision in the area close to 
the EOA where the train is allowed to run with release speed to approach the EOA.  
3.13.10.2  General requirements  
3.13.10.2.1  The train speed indicated to the driver shall be identical to the speed used for the 
speed monit oring . This shall be the estimated speed . 
3.13.10.2.2  Once a Train Interface command (traction cut -off, service brake or emergency brake) 
is triggered, the on -board shall apply it until its corresponding revocation condition is 
met. 
3.13.10.2.3  If there is no on -board interface w ith the service brake or if the use of the service brake 
command is not allowed by a National Value (only in Target speed monitoring),

 whenever a service brake command is specified, the emergency brake command shall 
be triggered instead.  
3.13.10.2.4  The emergency brak e command, which is triggered instead of the service brake 
command when an SBI supervision limit is exceeded, shall be revoked according to 
the requirements specified for the revocation of service brake command, unless the 
emergency brake command has been also triggered due to an EBI supervision limit. In 
such case, the condition for revoking the emergency brake command due to EBI 
supervision limit shall prevail.  
3.13.10.2.5  The on -board shall revoke the Intervention status only when no brake command is 
applied by the speed and distance monitoring function.  
3.13.10.2.6  In level 2/3: Train trip shall be initiated if the on -board equipment detects that the 
minimum safe front end has passed the EOA/LOA location.  
3.13.10.2.7  In Level 1: Train Trip shall be initiated if the on -board equipment detec ts that the 
minimum safe antenna position (calculated by subtracting distance between active 
Eurobalise antenna and the front end of the train from the min safe front end position) 
has passed the EOA/LOA location.  
3.13.10.2.8  In the following sections , the term V_MRSP  (together with the derived ceiling 
supervision limits) refers to the lowest MRSP element encountered between the min 
safe front end and the max safe front end of the train.  
3.13.10.3  Requirements for Ceiling speed monitoring  
3.13.10.3.1  The on -board equipment shall display the  Permitted speed.  
3.13.10.3.2  When the supervision status is Overspeed, Warning or Intervention, the on -board 
equipment shall display the SBI speed.  
3.13.10.3.3  The on -board shall compare the estimated speed with the ceiling supervision limits 
defined in section 3.13.9.2  and shall trigger /revoke  commands to the train interface 
(service brake if implemented or emergency brake) and supervision statuses  as 
described in Table 5 and Table 6.

3.13.10.3.5  When the speed and distance monitoring function becomes active and the ceiling 
speed monitoring is the first one entered, the tr iggering condition t1 defined in Table 5 
shall be checked in order to determine whether the Normal status applies. If it is not 
the case, the on -board shall immediately set the supervision status to the relevant 
value, applying a transition from the Normal status according to Table 7. 
3.13.10.3.6  The Indication status is not used in ceiling speed monitoring. However, in case the 
ceiling speed monitoring is entered and the supervision status was previously set to 
Indic ation, the on -board equipment shall immediately execute one of the transitions 
from the Indication status, as described in Table 7.

3.13.10.4  Requirements for Target speed monitoring  
3.13.10.4.1  In target speed monitoring, both t he ceiling supervision limits and the braking to target 
supervision limits, described in sections 3.13.9.2  and 3.13.9.3 , are used to determine 
the commands to the Train Interface and the information  displayed to the driver.  
3.13.10.4.2  The on -board equipment shall display to the driver the target information (target speed 
and distance to target) related to one target at a time: the Most Restrictive Displayed 
Target (MRDT). The MRDT shall be defined as the target  of which the braking to target  
Permitted speed supervision limit (refer to section 3.13.9.3.5 ), calculated for the 
current position of the train, is the lowest one amongst the supervised targets:

3.13.10.4.11  The braking to target Indication supervision limit is not used for estimated speeds 
higher than V_MRSP. However the location of the Indication supervision limit, valid for 
V_MRSP, shall be used for estimated speeds  higher than V_MRSP in order to 
discriminate whether information related to the Indication status has to be displayed to 
the driver. In other terms, for estimated speeds above V_MRSP, this location of the 
Indication supervision limit defines a pre -indicati on display area starting from the pre -
indication location and ending at this location.  
3.13.10.4.12  Note: Figure 56 shows the parts of the ceiling speed and braking to target 
supervision limits, which are used in target speed monitoring to tri gger the brake 
commands and the transitions between supervision statuses. It does not show what is 
displayed to the driver: in particular, the braking to target Permitted supervision limit is 
displayed (even if not supervised) for values lower than the rel ease speed.

3.13.10.4.14  Note: as long as the same MRSP or LOA target is displayed, the on -board  will 
revoke the Indication status only when the estimated speed does no longer exceed the 
target speed. On the other hand, as long as the same EOA/SvL target is displayed, the 
Indication status, once it is triggered, is never revoked. However, for all typ es of target 
and only in case of MRDT change, the on -board will revoke the Indication status if the

3.15 Special functions  
3.15.1  RBC/RBC Handover  
3.15.1.1  Introduction  
3.15.1.1.1  Trains with one or more radio(s) shall be able to pass from one RBC area to another 
automatically (without driver action).  
3.15.1.1.2  Since an RBC is unable to know whether the on -board is able to manage one or two 
communication session(s) at once, the following principles are applicable for both 
cases. Thereby, the RBCs will have the same behaviour in both cases.  
3.15.1.1.3  An RBC/RBC handover performed by a train with one communication session available 
may result in performance penalties since it will not be able to “prepare” (session 
establishment, version determination, …) the expected supervision by the Ac cepting 
RBC until the on -board disconnects from the Handing Over RBC.  
3.15.1.1.4  In level 3, trains following the one with one communication  session available will 
always suffer performance penalties since no more position reports will be issued from 
the disconnectio n from the Handing Over RBC until the connection to the Accepting 
RBC.  
3.15.1.2  Handing Over RBC  
3.15.1.2.1  When the Handing Over RBC detects that a route is set for a train to enter another 
RBC area, it shall send:  
a) Intentionally deleted.  
b) To the Accepting RBC the following in formation:  
 The ETCS identity of the on -board equipment;  
 The border location that will be passed by the train when entering the Accepting 
RBC area;  
 Current mode of the on -board equipment;  
 Optionally, Train Data;  
 Optionally, for a non -leading engine, the ETC S identity of the leading engine.  
3.15.1.2.2  The Handing Over RBC shall not send information to an on -board equipment 
concerning the route in advance of the border without receiving the corresponding 
information from the Accepting RBC.

 3.15.1.2.3  It shall be possible for the Ha nding Over RBC to request route related information from 
the Accepting RBC, limited to a maximum amount of data.  
3.15.1.2.3.1  Note: Route related information is :  
a) Movement authorities

the Handing Over RBC if possible.  
3.15.1.2.5  Deleted.  
3.15.1.2.6  When the Handing Over RBC receives a positio n report and detects that the maximum 
safe front end of the train has passed the border location, it shall inform the Accepting 
RBC.  
3.15.1.2.6.1  Note: This information might be needed to inform the signalman of the Accepting 
RBC that the train has entered the Acceptin g RBC area.  
3.15.1.2.7  When the Handing Over RBC receives a position report and detects that the minimum 
safe rear end of the train has crossed the border, it shall send a disconnection order to 
the on -board equipment.

 3.15.1.2.8  When the Accepting RBC informs the Handing Over RBC that it has taken over the 
responsibility, the latter shall stop sending route related information to the on -board 
equipment.  
3.15.1.2.9  When the Handing Over RBC detects that the transition to the Accepting RBC has to 
be cancelled, it shall send this cancellati on information to the Accepting RBC (including 
the train identification).  
3.15.1.2.9.1  Note: For instance, the cancellation procedure can be triggered by:  
 Change to a route which does no more include the border;  
 The sending of an “end of mission” information from the on-board equipment.  
3.15.1.3  On-board equipment  
3.15.1.3.1  When receiving an order to switch to another RBC at a given location, the on -board 
equipment shall:  
a) Establish the communication session with the Accepting RBC;  
b) Send a position report to the Handing Over RBC when the m aximum safe front end 
of the train passes the given location;  
c) Send a position report to the Handing Over RBC when the minimum safe rear end 
of the train passes the given location;  
3.15.1.3.2  It is up to the on -board equipment to manage the establishment of one commun ication 
session and the release of the other one:  
a) If it is able to handle two communication sessions at the same time, the radio 
session with the Accepting RBC shall be established as soon as it re ceives the RBC 
transition order . 
b) If it is able to handle on e communication session only at a given time, it shall wait 
until the session with the Handing over RBC is terminated due to crossing the 
border (refer to 3.5.5.1e and 3.15.1.2.7) and then establish the session with the 
Accepting RBC.  
3.15.1.3.3  As soon as the on -board equipment has established the session with the Accepting 
RBC, it shall send its Train Data unless it is in sleeping or non leading mode.  
3.15.1.3.4  When the on -board equipment is connected to both RBCs, it shall send its position 
reports to both of them with the u se of the position report parameters valid for the 
Handing Over RBC.  
3.15.1.3.4.1  If the on -board equipment is connected to both RBCs, and it executes an End of 
Mission, it shall execute the End of Mission procedure with both RBCs  
3.15.1.3.5  When the on -board sends a position rep ort directly to the Accepting RBC with its 
maximum safe front end having passed the border, it shall use information received 
from the Accepting RBC and only a disconnection order shall be accepted from the 
Handing Over RBC.

 3.15.1.3.5.1  Note: This requirement implies that the connection to the Accepting RBC and 
that the determination of the version have been achieved and that the on -board is able 
to handle two communication sessions at the same time.  
3.15.1.3.6  In case two communication sessions are opened, if information is rece ived from the 
Accepting RBC before a position report is sent to the Accepting RBC with the 
maximum safe front end having passed the border, this information shall be stored on -

updated. In particular, this possibly includes temporary speed restrictions.  
3.15.1.4.2  As soon as the Accepting RBC receives from the on -board equipment a position report 
and detects that the maximum safe front end of the train has passed the border, it shall  
inform the Handing Over RBC that it has taken over the responsibility.  
3.15.1.4.3  When the Accepting RBC receives Train Data from both the on -board equipment and 
the Handing over RBC Train Data provided by the on -board equipment shall take 
precedence.  
3.15.1.4.4  If the  Accepting RBC receives a cancellation information from the Handing Over RBC, 
it shall send an order to terminate the communication session to the corresponding on -

3.15.2  Handling of Trains with Non Leading Engines  
3.15.2.1  It shall be possible to operate a train using more than one engine, each engine being 
under the control of a driver.   
3.15.2.2  Only the leading engine shall be responsible for the train movement supervision 
functions.  
3.15.3  Splitting/joining  
3.15.3.1  ERTMS/ETCS shall allow Splitting and Joining using the normal supervision functions 
available (e.g. O n-sight, Shunting).  
3.15.3.2  Splitting only refers to the case that the two resulting trains contain at least one 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment each.  
3.15.3.2.1  Note: This must be ensured by operational procedures.  
3.15.3.3  ERTMS/ETCS is not responsible for providing information that a Splitting/Joining 
operation has been correctly completed (technical aspect and/or operational aspect).  
3.15.3.4  Justification: ERTMS/ETCS is not able to provide this information. Splitting and Joining 
shall require the fulfilment of operating rules ensuring that a Splitting/Joining operation 
has been correctly completed (e.g. physical disconnection).  
3.15.4  Reversing of movement direction  
3.15.4.1  It shall be possible to send in advance to an on -board equipment information about 
areas, where initiation of reversing of movement di rection is possible, i.e. change the 
direction of train movement without changing the train orientation.  
3.15.4.1.1  A new reversing area given from the trackside shall replace the one already available 
on-board.  
3.15.4.2  Together with start and end of reversing area, the foll owing supervision information 
shall be sent:  
a) Maximum distance to run in the direction opposite to the orientation of the reversing 
area, the fixed reference location being the end location of the area where reversing 
of movement is permitted  at the time of  reception of this reversing area information .

 3.15.4.4  While at standstill with the front end of the train inside the indicated area, it shall be 
possible for the driver to reverse the direction of movement.  
3.15.4.5  The on -board equipment shall allow movement in the direction opposite to the train 
orientation, s upervising it according to distance and speed received.  
3.15.4.6  Note: level transitions and RBC /RBC handovers  are not handled by the ERTMS/ETCS 
on-board equipment  when in Reversing mode . 
3.15.4.7  When at standstill the on -board equipment shall inform the driver if the reve rsing of 
movement is permitted.  
3.15.4.8  If the end location of the maximum distance to run in the opposite direction is passed 
by the train front end, the emergency brake command shall be triggered.  
3.15.5  Track ahead free  
3.15.5.1  In a level 2/3 area, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equ ipment shall be able to handle a 
track ahead free request given by the RBC.  
3.15.5.2  The track ahead free request from the RBC shall indicate to the on -board  
a) at which location the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall begin to display the 
request to the driver.  
b) at wh ich location the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall stop to display the 
request to the driver (in case the driver did not acknowledge).  
3.15.5.3  The driver shall have the possibility to acknowledge the track ahead free request 
(meaning the driver confirms that the  track between the head of the train and the next 
signal or board marking signal position is free).  
3.15.5.4  When the driver acknowledges, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall stop 
displaying the request, and shall inform the RBC that the track ahead is free.  
3.15.5.5  There shall be no restrictive consequence by the on -board system if the driver does 
not acknowledge.  
3.15.5.6  A new track ahead free request shall replace the one previously received and stored.  
3.15.6  Handling of National Systems  
3.15.6.1  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board shall support drivi ng on national infrastructure u nder the 
supervision of National Systems . 
3.15.6.2  In case the ERTMS/ETCS  on-board equipment is interfaced to a National System 
through an STM,  refer to Subset 035  for detailed requirements .

3.15.6.5  Amongst the data to be used by applications outside ERTMS/ETCS that can be 
transmitted by trackside over the ERTMS/ETCS transmission channels,  it shall be 
possible  to send from balises or RBC data to be forwarded to a  National System . 
3.15.6.5.1  Note: Definition of what qualifies as  “data to be forwarded  to a National System ” is 
national dependent and outside the scope of Subset 026.  
3.15.7  Tolerance of Big Metal Mass  
3.15.7.1  Big metal object in the track, exceeding the limits for big metal masses as def ined in 
Subset -036, section 6.5.2 “Metal Masses in the Track” may trigger an alarm reporting 
a malfunction for the onboard balise transmission function.  
3.15.7.2  In Levels 0/ NTC, the alarms which may be triggered by metal masses shall be ignored 
for a defined dista nce (see A3.1). If the alarm persists for a longer distance the 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall trigger a safety reaction.  
3.15.7.3  Justification: Ignoring the alarm for a defined distance eliminates the need to equip all 
excessive big metal masses with track c ondition “Big Metal Mass” outside ETCS fitted 
areas.  
3.15.8  Cold Movement Detection  
3.15.8.1  After being switched off (i.e. once in No Power mode), the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 
equipment shall be capable, if fitted with, to detect and record whether the engine has 
been moved o r not, during a period of at least 72 hours.  
3.15.8.2  When powered on again, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall use, if 
available, the memorised information about cold movement in order to update the 
status of information stored by on -board equipment (see chap ter 4 section 4.11 for 
details).  
3.15.8.3  Note: information memorised by Cold Movement Detection function is considered as 
not available if:  
a) no Cold Movement Detection function is implemented in the ERTMS/ETCS on -
board equipment, OR  
b) the Cold Movement Detection func tion has encountered a condition, during the No 
Power period, which prevents the use of the Cold Movement information (e.g. the 
battery ensuring the Cold Movement Detection function has run down during the No 
Power period).

 3.15.9  Virtual Balise Cover  
3.15.9.1  It shall be  possible to se t and remove from balise a Virtual Balise Cover  (VBC) . A VBC 
is defined by : 
a) A marker corresponding to balises to be ignored by the on -board  together  with the 
area (country or region) in which the VBC  is applicable . The VBC marker and the 
country/region identity form the unique VBC identity . 
b) Its validity period . 
3.15.9.2  During a start of mission, the driver shall have the opportunity to set a new VBC , or to 
remove an existing one. 
3.15.9.3  As long as a VBC is stored on -board:  
a) The ERTMS/ETC S on-board equipment shall ignore  any balise telegram that 
include s a VBC marker  and a country/region identity that both match the VBC 
identity.  
b) No reaction shall be applied if errors in the reading of the rest of such balise 
telegram occur.  
3.15.9.4  If the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipmen t receives from balise or from driver a new 
VBC with the same VBC identity as an already stored VBC, the new VBC shall replace 
the previous one, including its validity period . 
3.15.9.5  A VBC shall be retained on-board when the on -board equipment is switched off (i. e. 
enters No Power mode)  and shall remai n applicable  when powered on  again . It shall 
be deleted when:  
a) it is ordered  by trackside , or 
b) its validity period has elapsed , or 
c) it is removed by the d river (during Start of Mission), or  
d) a mismatch is detected betwee n the country/region identity read from  a balise group 
and the country/region identity of the VBC. Not e: this means that the reception of a 
consistent balise group message is a necessary condition for deleting  a VBC due to 
mismatching country/region  identities. 
3.15.10  Advance display of route related information  
3.15.10.1  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall offer the possibility to display , only on 
driver request, an overview of the gradient profile (as received from trackside), of the 
MRSP, of the track conditions  (except the tunnel stopping areas) , of the indication 
location at MRSP speed (see 3.13.10.4.11) and of the first target at zero speed, if any 
(e.g. the EOA or the start location of a mode profile) , with the remaining distances 
referred to the train front end p osition.

3.16 Data C Onsistency  
3.16.1  Criteria of consistency  
3.16.1.1  The on -board shall not consider a message transmitted from the trackside if any of the 
following criteria is not f ulfilled.  
a) Correctness of the received message: the whole message shall be complete and 
respect the ETCS language; variables shall not have invalid values  
b) The message shall be received in due time.  
c) The message shall be received at the right expected locati on. 
as stated below.

3.16.2  Balises  
3.16.2.1  Definitions  
3.16.2.1.1  The information that is sent from a balise is called a balise telegram.  
3.16.2.1.2  The whole set of information (balise telegram or telegrams) coming from a ba lise 
group is called a balise group message.  
3.16.2.1.2.1  Note: In case of a balise group containing a single balise, telegram and message 
coincide.  
3.16.2.1.3  A balise within a balise group shall be regarded as missed if  
a) No balise is found within the maximum distance between b alises from the previous 
balise in the group.  
or 
b) A following balise within the group has been passed.

 3.16.2.2.1  If the on -board is not able to recognise whether a balise group is linked or unlinked (if 
none of the balises in the balise group can be read cor rectly), it shall consider it as 
unlinked.  
3.16.2.2.2  Deleted  
3.16.2.3  Linking Consistency  
3.16.2.3.1  If linking information is used the on -board shall react according to the linking reaction 
information in the following cases:  
a) If the location reference of the expected balise group is found in rear of the 
expectation window  
b) If the location reference of the expected balise group is not found inside the 
expectation window (i.e. the end of  the expectation window has been reached 
without having found the expected balise group ) 
c) If inside the  expectation window of the expected balise group another announced 
balise group, expected later, is found.  
3.16.2.3.1.1  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall reject  the message from  a balise 
group found with its location reference outside its expectation window.  
3.16.2.3.2  The on-board shall reject the message from the expected group and trip the train if the 
balise group is passed in the unexpected direction.  
3.16.2.3.2.1  Exception: When the expected balise group is referred in the linking information 
with a balise group with ID “unknown”, 3.4.4.4.2.1 shall apply.  
3.16.2.3.3  If the location reference balise of the group is duplicated and the on -board is only able 
to correctly evaluate the duplicating one, the duplicating one shall be used as location 
reference instead.  
3.16.2.3.4  If the balise duplicating the loc ation reference balise is used as location reference for 
the group, and is found within the expectation window, no linking reaction shall be 
applied.  
3.16.2.4  Balise Group Message Consistency  
3.16.2.4.1  If linking information is used, the on -board shall reject the message fro m a linked 
balise group found in the expected location and react according to the linking reaction 
in the following cases:  
a) A balise is missed inside the group.  
b) A balise is detected but no telegram is decoded (e.g. wrong CRC,...).

3.16.2.4.7  Comparing message counters of the received telegrams of a balise group message, 
excluding the ones complying with 3.16.2 .4.6, if their values are not al l identical, or at 
least one of  them complies with 3.16.2.4.6.1, this shall be considered as a message 
consistency error.  
3.16.2.4.7.1  In case of single balise group, if the message counter of the received telegram 
complies with 3.16.2.4 .6.1, this shall also be considered as a message consistency 
error.  
3.16.2.4.8  It shall be possible to indicate failures in the system underlying the balise/loop/RIU 
(e.g. the Lineside Electronic Unit, LEU) by sending a balise telegram, a loop message 
or a RIU messag e including the information "default balise/loop/RIU information".  
3.16.2.4.8.1  If one (and only one) out of a pair of duplicated balise telegrams received by the

 a) the on -board antenna leaves the expectation window of the repositioning balise 
group that was announced and already found  
b) a linked balise group that has been announced wi th known identity is found.  
3.16.2.7.2.2  If a second balise group is found that satisfies the same criteria as the previously

3.16.3.1.4  The chapters 3.16.3.2 to 3.16.3.5 define data consistency principles and 
corresponding checks for data transmitted as normal priority data.  
For high priority data, the checks shall not apply.

3.17 System Version  Management  
3.17.1  Introduction  
3.17.1.1  Definitions, high level principles and rules regarding the offline management of 
ERTMS/ETCS system version during the ERTMS/ETCS system life time are given in 
SUBSET -104. 
3.17.1.2  The objective of t his section  is to define requirements applicable to ERTMS/ETCS on -
board equipment and to trackside constituents, when different versions  of the 
ERTMS/ETCS system have been defined . 
3.17.1.3  Intentionally deleted . 
3.17.2  Determination of the operated system version  
3.17.2.1  The on -board equipment shall be able to operate with (i.e. shall support) any of the 
ERTMS/ETCS system version  number s X included in the envelope of legally operated 
system versions, as defined in chapter 6.  
3.17.2.2  The on -board equipment shall operate with only one syst em version at a time, i.e. it 
shall behave according to the whole set of requirements applicable to a system version 
(refer to chapter 6 in case the operated system version is older than the last one 
introduced in this release of the SRS).  
3.17.2.3  The on -board equ ipment shall determine the operated system version, in relation to 
non-RBC trackside constituents, as the system version number X transmitted by any 
balise, loop or RIU, if this system version number X is higher than the currently 
operated one.  
3.17.2.4  It shall be  possible from balise group to order the on -board equipment to operate a 
system version.  
3.17.2.5  On receiving the order to operate system version from balise group, the on -board 
equipment shall immediately operate the system version given in the order. After the 
order is executed, the requirement 3.17.2.3 shall be again applied for any further 
received balise telegram/loop message or any further contacted RIU.  
3.17.2.5.1  Note: the system version order is to be used wherever it is necessary to enforce an 
operated system versio n number X lower than the currently operated one.  
3.17.2.6  If a mismatch has been detected between the country or region identifier read from a 
balise/loop and the corresponding identifier(s) for which a set of national values is used 
onboard, the on -board equipmen t shall consider the system version number X

 transmitted by this balise/loop as the operated one and shall comply again with 
requirement 3.17.2.3.  
3.17.2.7  If the on -board equipment does not support the system version number X transmitted 
by a non -RBC trackside con stituent or the one specified in the balise group order, it 
shall consider the operated system version as unchanged.  
3.17.2.8  In case of communication session established with an RBC, the system version of the 
RBC shall take precedence on the operated system versio n in relation to non -RBC 
constituents and on system version ordered from balise group; the operated system 
version shall be determined according to the following principles:  
a) if the on -board equipment is in level 0, NTC or 1 (e.g. entrance in level 2/3 area ), 
the RBC system version shall be operated when the transition to level 2/3 is 
executed;  
b) if the on -board equipment is in level 2/3 (SoM procedure or order received from 
trackside), the RBC system version shall be operated immediately;  
c) in case of session e stablished with an accepting RBC (RBC/RBC Handover), the 
accepting RBC system version shall be operated as soon as the engine has passed 
the RBC/RBC border location with its maximum safe front end;  
d) in case the on -board equipment switches from level 2/3 to another level (e.g. exit 
from a level 2/3 area), the system version control in relation to non -RBC 
constituents shall be again applied and the balise group orders shall be again 
considered;  
e) in case the engine passes the RBC/RBC border location with its max imum safe 
front end and no session is established with the accepting RBC, the system version 
control in relation to non -RBC constituents shall be again applied and the balise 
group orders shall be again considered.  
3.17.2.9  The system version currently operated whe n the on -board equipment is switched off 
(i.e. enters  No Power mode) shall be retain ed and re -used when powered on.  
3.17.2.9.1  If the on -board equipment loses the information (failure situation), the highest 
supported system version shall be used.  
3.17.3  Handling of tracksi de data in relation to system version  
3.17.3.1  Every telegram transmitted by a balise, and every message transmitted by Euroloop 
and Radio Infill Unit shall contain only the data related to one system version. It is not 
allowed for the balise, Euroloop and Radio In fill Unit to transmit data correspondent to 
several system versions.  
3.17.3.2  All messages transmitted by an RBC shall contain data only related to one system 
version.

be ignored.  
b) In all levels, if this system version number X is different from 0 and lower than the 
lowest system version number X supported by the on -board equipment, it shall be 
able to interpret the balise  information, to the extent defined for each type of 
information (see chapter 6 for detailed requirements). If the on -board is not able to 
interpret the information, this shall be considered as a message consistency error.  
c) In all levels, if this system ver sion number X is amongst its supported ones, the on -
board equipment shall be able to interpret the balise information. See chapter 6 for 
detailed requirements.  
d) In levels 1, 2 and 3, if this system version number X is greater than the highest 
version number  X supported by the on -board equipment , the information from this 
balise shall be ignored, the train shall be tripped and an indication shall be given to 
the driver.  
e) In levels 0 and NTC, if this system version number X is greater than the highest 
version n umber X supported by the on -board equipment, the information from this 
balise shall be ignored and no reaction shall be applied.  
3.17.3.6  In level 1 the on -board equipment shall check the ERTMS/ETCS system version 
number X transmitted by any Euroloop found : 
a) if this  system version number X is lower than the lowest system version number X 
supported by the on -board equipment, it shall be able to interpret the loop 
information, to the extent defined for each type of information (see chapter 6 for 
detailed requirements).  If the on -board is not able to interpret the information, this 
shall be considered as a message consistency error.  
b) if this system version number X is amongst its supported ones, the on -board 
equipment shall be able to interpret the loop information. See c hapter 6 for detailed 
requirements.  
c) If this system version number X is greater than the highest version number X 
supported by the on -board equipment , no reaction shall be applied and the 
information from th is loop shall be ignored .

 3.18.2.3  National Values are transmitted with the area(s) (country or region) in which they are 
applicable. They shall be come  applicable at a defined location, or shall be applicable 
immediately.  
3.18.2.4  Evaluating  a balise group message, the balise identity information referring to the 
country or region shall be used to ensure that correct National Values are used.  
3.18.2.5  For each National Value, the corresponding Default Value shall be used as fall back 
value if:  
 the Nat ional Value  is not available, or  
 a mismatch has been detected between the country or region identifier read from a 
balise group and the corresponding identifier(s) of the applicable  set with which the  
National Value was received and stored . 
3.18.2.6  Note: even th ough the National Values are always transmitted as a single  set for a 
given system version, the content of a set depends on the system version, so that 
when a set of National Values is received or becomes applicable, or when passing a 
balise group, the on -board equipment may apply clause 3.18.2.5 for a subset of 
National Values  
3.18.2.7  The National Values currently applicable when the on -board equipment is switched off 
(i.e. enters No Power mode) shall be retained and shall remain  applicable  when 
powered on.  
3.18.2.7.1  Justif ication:  The aim of this requirement is to limit the number of balise groups 
containing National Value information. Once a set of National Values has been 
received on -board, there is no need to re -load the information unless National Values 
change, the on -board equipment loses the information (failure situation), or the train 
enters an area requiring different National Values.  
3.18.2.8  The applicable set of National Values data shall be transmitted from the trackside on 
transition between areas requiring a differen t set of National Values.  
3.18.2.8.1  When a new set of National Values becomes applicable it s content  shall always 
overwrite the corresponding National Values  currently applicable regardless of the 
country or region identifier(s).  
3.18.2.9  A previously received set of Nationa l Values which is not yet applicable shall be 
deleted if:  
 a new set of National Values is received, or  
 the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment is switched off (i.e., enters No Power 
mode).  
3.18.2.10  If a National Value becomes invalid, i.e., a mismatch has been detected b etween the 
country or region identifier read from a balise group and the corresponding identifier(s) 
of the applicable  set with which  the National Value was received and stored , then it 
shall be deleted.

A.3.3 Handling of information received from trackside  
A3.3.1  Before it can be accepted and used by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment, raw 
information received from trackside is subject to various checks, which can le ad to the 
individual rejection/ignoring of information (e.g. Movement Authority not valid for the 
train orientation), the ignoring of a whole balise telegram or the rejection of a whole 
message. The SRS clauses/sections corresponding to these checks are ga thered in

A.3.3.2  With the exception of the clauses/sections referred to in Table 17 and of the clause 
3.16.3.5.1, all the clauses in this specification in which trackside information is referr ed 
to (through the terms “balise”, “telegram”, “balise group [message]”, “message”, 
“[name of] information”...), shall be applied assuming that the information has not been 
ignored/rejected by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment due to all the checks listed 
in Table 17. 
A.3.3.3  Example 1: clause 3.16.2.4.9 has to be understood as follows: “If a <consistent>  
message <composed with telegrams that have passed the system version check, that 
have not been ignored because of a VBC, that ha ve not been ignored because of 
duplication, and that have been received while no reverse movement was performed> 
has been received < with one of its telegrams composing it>  containing the information 
“default balise information” <which is valid for the trai n orientation (or the balise group 
crossing direction for NL or SL engines) and which has passed the level and mode 
filters> , the driver shall be informed.”  
A.3.3.4  Example 2: as a result of the clause A.3.3.2, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment 
will not ap ply requirements in relation to the content of the telegram or the message 
such as:

  clause 3.6.2.2.2 a), in case the balise group message is rejected because not 
consistent (e.g. according to 3.16.2.4.1), it does not become LRBG  
 clause 3.16.3.3.3.1, in cas e the radio message is rejected because of its time 
stamp, this latter will not be used by the on -board to check the supervision of 
sequence of further messages  
 clause 3.17.2.3, in case the balise telegram is ignored because of its system 
version number (e .g. according to 3.17.3.5 d)), this latter will not affect the system 
version operated by the on -board  
 clause 3.18.2.5 2nd bullet, in case a message from a balise group marked as linked 
is rejected because the balise group was not announced by linking (see  
3.16.2.4.3), the balise group country or region identifier will not be compared with 
the one(s) of the currently applicable set of National Values  
A.3.4 Handling of Accepted and Stored Information in specific 
Situations  
A.3.4.1  Introduction  
A.3.4.1.1  All data that can be stored onboard after being accepted may be influenced in special 
situations.  
A.3.4.1.2  The situations acting on the “status” of stored information are:  
a) the execution of a conditional emergency stop (3.10.2.2);  
b) the reception of a shortened MA ( 3.8.5.1.3, 3.8.5.1.4 ); 
c) the stored MA is shortened due to a section time -out (3.8.4.2.2);  
d) the SvL is shifted (to the DP if any or to the EOA) due to an overlap time -out 
(3.8.4.4.2) ;  
e) the stored MA is shortened due to an end section time -out (3.8.4.1.2);  
f) a cooperative MA revocation is granted by the onboard (3.8.6.2);  
g) inconsistency in a balise group marked as unlinked and the train is at standstill 
(3.16.2.5.2);  
h) a linking reaction led to a service brake and the train is at standstill (3.16.2.6.2) ;  
i) the re action due to the supervision of the safe radio connection led to a service 
brake and the train is at standstill (3.16.3.4.5 b) ;  
j) the train category, axle load  category , loading gauge or traction system  is changed 
and the train is at standstill (3.18.3.7) ; 
k) driver closes the desk during SoM ;  
l) RAMS related supervision functions led to a service brake and the train is at 
standstill (3.16.2.7)

 m) inconsistency in a balise group marked as linked and no linking is used onboard 
and the train is at standstill  (3.16.2 .4.4.2)  
n) the Limit of Authority becomes an End of Authority and the on -board considers an 
SvL (3.8.4.3.2)  
A.3.4.1.3  Depending on the situation, the action can be:  
a) data is deleted,  
b) data is reset (set to initial states)  
c) data status is unchanged,  
d) data is to be  revalidated

 A.3.5 Handling of Actions in Specific Situations  
A.3.5.1 Regards actions executed in reference to location information received from trackside, 
the on -board equipment shall ensure that the action related to a location is neither 
reverted, nor executed twice. Situations to be considered shall include reverse 
movement (initiated by driver or due to roll -away) and the sub -sequent forward 
movement, or adjustment of train position on passing a new LRBG . This rule shall 
apply to the following actions:  
 Change of National Values (see 3.18.2)  
 Request to acknowledge ne w level, level transition (see SRS chapter 5.10)  
 Start and stop displaying plain or fixed text messages (see 3.12.3)  
 Request to acknowledge a mode profile, mode transition due to mode profile (see 
3.12.4)  
 Start and stop accepting radio infill information ( see 3.9.3)  
 Actions related to RBC/RBC handover (see 3.15.1)  
 Actions related to track condition information (see 3.12.1) with the exception of big 
metal masses  and non stopping areas  
 Permission to initiate Reversing mode, i.e., limits of Reversing Area (see  3.15.4)  
 Start and stop Track Ahead free request to driver (see 3.15.5)”  
 Start and stop calculation of geographical position (see 3.6.6)  
A.3.5.2  Once the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment has received a balise group message 
(i.e. once it has received the last balise telegram of the balise group), the action(s) 
resulting from its content shall take into account the train position measured at the time 
of reception of this last telegram and shall take precedence on any other action related 
to a further location th at is reached before the message has been fully processed.  
A.3.5.2.1  Example 1: in level 1, the crossing of the EOA/LOA location with the min safe antenna, 
before a new extended MA (received when the min safe antenna was in rear of the 
EOA/LOA) has been pr ocessed, will not lead to train trip. In other terms the 
replacement of the EOA/LOA is considered by the on -board as happening before the 
min safe antenna crosses the EOA/LOA location (i.e. preventing that clause 
3.13.10. 2.7 applies).  
A.3.5.2.2  Example 2: when the override function is active, the crossing of the former EOA 
location by the min safe antenna, before a “Stop if in SR” information (received when 
the min safe antenna was in rear of the former EOA) has been processed, will not lead 
to the end of t he override procedure followed by a train trip due to “Stop if in SR”. In 
other terms, both the deletion of the former EOA and the end of override procedure

 (see 5.8. 3.1.3 and 5.8.4.1 c)) are considered by the on -board as simultaneously 
happening before th e min safe antenna crosses the former EOA/LOA location.  
A.3.6 Deletion of accepted and stored information when used  
A3.6.1  Standard case  
A3.6.1.1  When the train moves in the direction of its train orientation, storage capacity occupied 
by trackside informa tion no longer used, i.e., the related on -board functionality has 
been completed, shall be made available immediately.  
A3.6.1.1.1  Note: The requirement is needed to allow trackside to predict the storage capacity 
available on -board in order to comply with dimensioning rules regards information 
stored on -board given in Subset 040.  
A3.6.2 Exception  
A3.6.2.1  Following information shall remain stored on -board for a distance defined by a fixed 
value in rear of the min safe rear end position of the train:  
 locatio n dependent static speed restrictions , i.e., SSP, ASP, TSR , LX SR, PBD SR  
(see 3.11.2.2)  
 gradient information,  
 reduced adhesion information received from trackside,  
 Track condition “Big metal masses”.  
A3.6.2.1.1  Note: The above information remains stored for the case of a reverse movement:  
 With the exception of the track condition “Big metal masses”,  the stored 
information allows the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment to calculate speed 
supervision limits after a reverse movement (roll -away, or initiated by th e driver)  
 Track condition “Big metal masses” is needed also for a reverse movement itself to 
avoid any false alarms due to Big metal masses in the track.  
A3.6.2.1.2  Note: The distance to intervention of the roll away or reverse movement supervision is 
determined by a National/Default value.  This is also true for a reverse movement in 
Post trip mode. However, following an intervention, the train will not stop immediately. 
In order to keep the on -board functionality simple, a fixed distance value was chosen  
to define an unambiguous location in rear of the train where the above information is 
no longer required and the related on -board storage capacity is made available again.  
A.3.7  Calculation of the basic deceleration  
A.3.7.1  The brake percentage (λ) shall  be converted into two different input parameters:  
λo = λ for calculation of emergency brake deceleration (A_brake_emergency(V))

 λo = MIN (λ, 135) for calculation of service brake deceleration (A_brake_service(V))  
where λ is the brake percentage defined as  part of Train Data.  
A.3.7.2  The calculation of the basic deceleration (A_basic(V)) shall use a common algorithm 
that will be used twice, once for the service brake and once for the emergency brake.  
A.3.7.3  The speed limit for the first step shall be calcu lated as V_lim = x * λ oy. 
V_lim is the speed limit for the first step in km/h  
x = 16.85

A.3.7.4  The first step of the basic deceleration shall be calculated as AD_0 = A * λ o + B 
AD_0 is the basic deceleration in m/s2 for 0 ≤ speed ≤ V_lim.  
A = 0. 0075  
B = 0.076  
A.3.7.5  The following steps of the basic deceleration shall be calculated by means of a set of 
polynomials of the third order with the following format:  
AD_n = a3_n * λo3 + a2_n * λo2 + a1_n * λo + a0_n  
and with the following values for n (a ll speed limits in km/h):

n = 5    valid for V_lim < speed   if V_lim > 180

A.3.10  Service brake feedback  
A.3.10.1  The purpose of service brake feedback is to reduce the distance between the SBI and 
EBI supervision limits and between the SBI and SBD curves.

a) The service brake feedback is implemented, AND  
b) The national value does not inhibit its use.  
A.3.10.3  Two different types of feedback from the service brake are specified, main brake pipe 
pressure and brake cylinder p ressure. The algorithms below are made for main brake 
pipe pressure. When brake cylinder pressure is used instead this shall be converted 
into a fictive main brake pressure value in the following way:

p =  500  - p_cylinder / k1  
A.3.10.4  The value of T_bs1 and T_bs2 shall be calculated according to the following algori thm 
to take the service brake feedback into account:  
p = current main brake pipe pressure (or fictive main brake pipe pressure calculated in

A.3.10.5  Note: If T_bs1 and T_bs2 have been locked to 0s and 2 s, the loc king will remain until 
the target speed monitoring is left, even if the train speed comes below the target 
speed. This avoids “jumping” indications. It also makes it possible to release the 
brakes before a speed reduction, without having the curves moving back again. It 
might though result in emergency brake intervention if the driver releases the brakes 
too early. But since EBI is not moved, this is not a safety issue. To keep 2 s between 
the SBI and EBI enables the service brake to be activated first and thus may avoid 
emergency brake.  
A.3.10.6  Note: If feedback has started but T_bs1 and T_bs2 are not locked, the feedback 
function will remain active until the target point is reached. This avoids “jumping” 
indications in some rare situations.

 4.4.8  SHUNTING  
4.4.8.1  Description  
4.4.8.1.1  The purpose of the Shunting mode is to enable shunting movements. In Shunting 
mode, The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment supervises the train movements 
against:  
a) a ceiling speed: the shunting mode speed limit  
b) a list of expected balise  group s (if such list was sent by the trackside equipment). 
The train shall be tripped if a balise group, not contained in the list, is passed 
(When an empty list is sent, no balise group can be passed. When no list is sent, 
all balise groups can be passed)  
c) “stop if in shunting mode” information. The train is tripped if such information is 
received from balise groups  
d) Intentionally deleted  
4.4.8.1.2  The Shunting mode shal l not require Train Data.  
4.4.8.1.3  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall perform the Train Position function  
4.4.8.1.4  Intentionally deleted.  
4.4.8.1.5  When in Shunting mode, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board shall not manage level 
transitions. However, an immediate level transition order or a conditional level 
transition order shall be stored and evaluated only when another mode than Shunting 
or Passive Shunting has been entered  (i.e. when the Shunting movement is 
terminated) . 
4.4.8.1.5.1  When receiving a communication session establishment order, the ER TMS/ETCS on -
board in Shunting mode shall not establish the communication session, but shall store 
the RBC ID/phone number . 
4.4.8.1.5.2  When in Shunting mode, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board shall not manage RBC -RBC 
hand -over, except for storing the RBC ID/phone number given a t the RBC/RBC border.  
4.4.8.1.6  Shunting mode can be selected by the driver, only accepted when the train is at 
standstill, or ordered by the trackside.  
4.4.8.1.7  In case of selection of Shunting mode by the driver:  
 in level 1 operations, the switch to shunting is always acce pted by the on -board 
equipment  
 in level 2 and 3 areas, the on -board shall ask the trackside for an authorisation. The 
switch to shunting is possible only after receiving such authorisation. The trackside 
can send a list of balises, that the train is allowe d to pass while in SH, together with 
the authorisation

 4.4.8.1.8  In case of order to switch to Shunting mode from trackside, the order:  
 in level 1 is given by a balise group. A list of balises, that the train is allowed to pass 
after the entry in Shunting, can be se nt together with the order  
 in level 2 and 3 is sent via radio. A list of balises, that the train is allowed to pass 
after the entry in Shunting, can be sent together with the order  
4.4.8.1.9  When the switch to shunting is ordered by trackside, a driver acknowledgeme nt is 
requested.  
4.4.8.1.9.1  Note: in Shunting mode the train is only partially supervised, therefore it is necessary

 4.4.11  STAFF RESPONSIBLE  
4.4.11.1  Description  
4.4.11.1.1  The Staff Responsible mode allows the driver to move the train under his own 
responsibility in an ERTMS/ETCS equipped area.  
4.4.11.1.2  This mode is used when the system does not know the route. For example:  
a) After the ERTMS/E TCS on -board equipment starts -up (awakening of the train).  
b) To pass a signal at danger / override an EOA.  
c) After a trackside failure (for example: loss of radio contact).  
4.4.11.1.3  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall supervise train movements against : 
a) a ceiling sp eed: the staff responsible mode speed limit  
b) a given distance (regarding its origin location see 4.4.11.1.3.1) . The ERTMS/ETCS 
on-board equipment shall supervise braking curves with a target speed of zero to 
the end of this distance. If the train overpasse s this distance (see next note) the 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall trip the train  
c) a list of expected balise  group s, if this list has been sent by the RBC. The train 
shall be tripped if over -passing a balise group that is not in the list. (When an 
empt y list is sent, no balise group can be passed. When no list is sent, all balise 
groups can be passed)  
d) balise groups giving the order ‘stop if in SR’. This order shall immediately trip the 
train, unless the over -passed balise group is included in a list of expected balises 
as defined in item c)  
e) running in the direction opposite to the train orientation (reverse movement 
protection)  
4.4.11.1.3.1  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board shall determine the start location of the SR distance 
as follows:  
a) If the National/Default value determin es the max permitted distance to run in SR 
mode, the starting point of this distance shall refer to the estimated position of the 
train front when SR mode was entered, or, already in Staff Responsible mode, 
when Override was activated.  
b) If the max permitted  distance to run in SR mode is determined by the value 
transmitted by the RBC, or entered by the driver, the start location of the distance 
shall refer to the estimated position of the train front when the distance information 
is received or entered . 
c) If the max permitted distance to run in SR mode is determined by the value 
transmitted by EUROLOOP, the distance information transmitted by EUROLOOP 
shall be referred to one or more reference balise groups. On -board shall evaluate

the LRBG.  
In case the LRBG is, due to a change of orientation, in front of the train when the 
distance to run in SR mode is to be determined from the EUROLOOP information, 
the complete distance to run in SR mode shall be determined as the distance 
given by EUROLOOP plus the distance between the estimated train front end and 
the LRBG.  
4.4.11.1.4  Note:  Since the gradient is unknown, the supervision of the braking curves in Staff 
Responsible mode does not ensure that th e train will not pass the given distance.  
4.4.11.1.5  The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall give the possibility to the driver to modify 
the value of the SR mode speed limit and of the given distance. This shall be possible 
only at standstill.  
4.4.11.1.5.1  If a train movement is  detected while the driver is entering the SR speed/distance 
limits, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall trigger the brake command.  
4.4.11.1.5.2  The unit, range and resolution of the SR mode speed limit and distance entered 
by the driver shall be as specified in A. 3.11. 
4.4.11.1.6  In level 2/3, the driver shall have the possibility to request a new distance to run in 
Staff Responsible , by selecting "Start". This trigger s an MA request.  
4.4.11.1.6.1  Note: Once the SR distance is covered, the driver may have to go further.  
4.4.11.1.6.2  When entering SR m ode, the value applicable for SR mode speed  limit and the 
value applicable for SR distance shall be the corresponding National/Default value s. 
Exception for SR distance: SR mode is authorised by RBC giving an SR distance.  
4.4.11.1.6.3  While in SR mode, the value applic able for the SR mode speed limit shall be, if 
available, the last value entered by the driver . 
4.4.11.1.6.4  While in SR mode, the value applicable for the SR distance shall be, if available, 
the last value received by the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment amongst:  
a) the dist ance to run in SR entered by the driver ; 
b) the distance to run in SR given by trackside . 
4.4.11.1.6.5  When "Override" is selected , the SR mode s peed  limit value and the SR distance 
value previously entered by driver or given by trackside, if any, shall be deleted. The 
corresponding National/Default value s shall enter in force.

4.4.14.1.3  The train shall only be authorised to move backwards a given distance (national value). 
The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall supervise this natio nal distance for 
reverse movements, and shall command the service brakes if the distance is over -
passed. The driver shall be informed about the reason for the brake application.  
4.4.14.1.3.1  Note:  The ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment performs the Reverse Movement 
Protectio n (as in PT mode, the "normally allowed movement" is backwards, then the 
Reverse Movement Protection avoids the train running in forward direction when in PT 
mode). This implies that the given distance to run backwards in PT is considered as a 
directional data, oriented backwards.  
4.4.14.1.3.2  After the release of a brake command initiated due to an overpassed distance 
allowed for moving backwards in Post Trip mode, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board

 4.4.18  REVERSING  
4.4.18.1  Description  
4.4.18.1.1  The Reversing mode allows the driver to change the direction of movement of the train 
and drive from the same cab, i.e. the train orientation remains unchanged. This shall 
be possible only in areas so marked by trackside. Reversing areas shall be announced 
in advance by trackside.  
4.4.18.1.2  Note: This mode is used to allow the train to esca pe from a dangerous situation and to 
reach as fast as possible a “safer” location.  
4.4.18.1.3  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall supervise train movements against : 
a) a ceiling speed : the Reversing mode speed limit  given from trackside  
b) a distance to run in the dire ction opposite to the train orientation , given from 
trackside. The emergency brake shall be commanded if overpassing this distance  
4.4.18.1.4  After the release of a brake command initiated due to an overpassed reversing 
distance, and while the reversing distance is s till overpassed, the ERTMS/ETCS on -
board equipment shall command the emergency brake for any further movement in the 
direction opposite to the train orientation . 
4.4.18.1.5  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall display the train speed, the permitted 
speed and  the remaining distance to run . 
4.4.18.1.6  In case the SBI supervision limit is exceeded (refer to chapter 3  table 5, triggering 
condition t4), the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall command the emergency 
brake  instead of the service brake . For the revocation of the brake  command, refer to 
3.13.10.2.4.  
4.4.18.1.7  The position reports sent when in reversing mode shall refer to the location of the 
driving cab (as before reversing).  
4.4.18.1.8  Note:  The ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment performs the Reverse Movement 
Protection (as in RV mode, the "norm ally allowed movement" is backwards, then the 
Reverse Movement Protection avoids the train running in forward direction when in RV 
mode). This implies that the given distance to run in reversing is considered as a 
directional data, oriented backwards.  
4.4.18.1.9  Note : for the list of main functions related to this mode, refer to chapter  4.5 “Modes 
and on-board  functions” . 
4.4.18.1.10  In case of balise group message consistency error (refer to 3.16.2.4.4 and 3.16.2.5.1), 
the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment shall not command the servi ce brake.  
4.4.18.1.11  In case there is an alarm reporting a malfunction for the onboard balise transmission 
function, the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment shall ignore this alarm .

 4.4.19  LIMITED  SUPERVISION  
4.4.19.1  Description  
4.4.19.1.1  The Limited Supervision mode enables the train to be op erated in areas where 
trackside information can be supplied to realise background supervision of the train.  
4.4.19.1.2  Limited supervision can not be selected by the driver, but shall be entered 
automatically when commanded by trackside and all necessary conditions a re fulfilled.  
4.4.19.1.3  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall supervise train movements against a 
dynamic speed profile.  
4.4.19.1.4  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall display the train speed  and the release 
speed, if any (this list is not exhaustive – refer to chapter 4 .7 “DMI depending on 
modes”). Upon request by trackside (refer to clauses 4.4.19.1.4.2 to 4.4.19.1.4.6) if the 
generic LS function marker is stored on -board or if the conditions in clause 
4.4.19.1.4.7 are fulfilled, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall also display the 
lowest speed amongst:  
a) the lowest MRSP element between the minimum safe front end of the train and the 
EOA/LOA, AND  
b) the target speed at the EOA/LOA  
4.4.19.1.4.1  The speed resulting from 4.4.19.1.4 a) and b) is called the Lowest Supervised 
Speed within t he Movement Authority (LSSMA)  
4.4.19.1.4.2  Upon an order to toggle on the LSSMA display, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 
equipment shall start a delay timer:  
a) For order received from RBC/RIU: at the value of the time stamp of the message 
including the order.  
b) For order received from balise group: at the time of passage over the first 
encountered balise of the balise group giving the order . 
c) Exception to a) and b): for order that has been stored in the level transition buffer 
(see section 4.8.3): at the time the level transition is  performed . 
4.4.19.1.4.3  When the delay timer value becomes greater than the time -out value given by 
trackside, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall display the LSSMA.  
4.4.19.1.4.4  On reception of an order to toggle (on or off) the LSSMA display, a toggle on 
order which has not been executed yet (because the on -board delay timer has not 
reached the delay time -out value) shall be deleted by the on -board equipment.  
4.4.19.1.4.5  If the LSSMA display is already toggled on, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 
equipment shall toggle off the LSSMA display in ca se:

 a) the clause 4.4.19.1.4.3 is not immediately fulfilled upon reception of a new order to 
toggle on the LSSMA display  
b) an order to toggle off the LSSMA display is received . 
4.4.19.1.4.6  When entering the Limited Supervision mode, the LSSMA display shall be 
toggled off b y the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment, unless a toggle on order is 
received and leads immediately to the display of the LSSMA as per clauses 
4.4.19.1.4.2 and 4.4.19.1.4.3.  
4.4.19.1.4.7  If the generic LS function marker is not stored on -board, the clauses 4.4.19.1.4.2 
to 4.4.19.1.4.6 shall not apply and the LSSMA shall be displayed if:  
a) the target speed at the EOA/LOA is lower than the Limited Supervision mode speed 
limit, AND  
b) the LSSMA is lower than the maximum train speed.  
4.4.19.1.4.8  The generic LS function marker shall be deleted b y the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 
equipment as soon as a Limited Supervision mode profile is received without it in the 
same balise group message . 
4.4.19.1.5  If receiving a "track ahead free" request from the RBC, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 
equipment requests the driver to ente r the "track ahead free" information.  
4.4.19.1.6  To be in Limited Supervision mode, SSP and gradient are not required for the whole 
length of the train, but shall be at least available from the FRONT END of the train.  
4.4.19.1.7  Note: for the list of main functions related to t his mode, refer to 4.5 “Modes and on-

4.4.19.3  Responsibilities  
4.4.19.3.1  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment is responsible for the background supervision 
of the train movement  to the extent permitted by the informati on provided by trackside.  
4.4.19.3.1.1  Note: The Limited Supervision mode enables the train to be operated in areas 
equipped with lineside signals where ETCS does not have information regarding the 
status of some signals, i.e. not all signals are fitted with LEUs or co nnected to an RBC  
4.4.19.3.2  The driver must always observe the existing line -side information (signals, speed 
boards etc.)  and National operating rules . 
4.4.19.3.2.1  Note: the indications given to the driver by the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 
equipment do not substitute the observance o f the line -side information. In particular

 4.4.20  PASSIVE  SHUNTING  
4.4.20.1  Description  
4.4.20.1.1  The Passive Shunting mode is defined to manage the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 
equipment of a slave engine (NOT remote controlled, but mechanically coupled to the 
leading engine) , being part of a shunting consist. This mode can also be used to c arry 
on a shunting movement with a s ingle engine fitted with one on -board equipment and 
two cabs, when the driver has to change the driving cab . 
4.4.20.1.2  The desk of a Passive Shunting engine must be closed (since there is no driver, no 
information shall be shown).  
4.4.20.1.3  As the engine is coupled to a leading engine, its ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment 
shall not perform any train movement supervision.  
4.4.20.1.4  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall perform Train Position function;  in 
particular, the front/rear end of the engine (i.e ., not the train) shall be used to refer to 
train front/rear end.  
4.4.20.1.5  It shall only be possible to enter in Passive Shunting mode from the Shunting mode; 
while in Shunting mode, the driver shall have the possibility to enable the function 
“Continue Shunting on  desk closure” . 
4.4.20.1.6  When the active desk is closed, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall switch to 
Passive Shunting mode  if the function “Continue Shunting on desk closure” is active 
and the “passive shunting input signal” is received from the train interfa ce. If the 
function “Continue Shunting on desk closure” is not active or the “passive shunting 
input signal” is not present, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall switch to 
Stand -By mode instead.  
4.4.20.1.7  The special function “Continue Shunting on desk closure” s hall allow one and only one 
transition from Shunting mode to Passive Shunting mode. The special function shall be 
inactive once the Shunting mode is left.  
4.4.20.1.8  If a desk of the Passive Shunting engine is opened  and no “Stop Shunting on desk 
opening” information  previously received from balise group is stored onboard , the 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall switch to Shunting mode.  
4.4.20.1.9  If a desk of the Passive Shunting engine is opened and “Stop Shunting on desk 
opening” information previously received from balise gr oup is stored onboard, the 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall switch to Stand By mode.  
4.4.20.1.10  If possible, the train must not be stopped due to a safety critical fault in a Passive 
Shunting engine. The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall therefore try to 
memoris e the occurrence of such fault(s), which shall be handled when the engine 
leaves the Passive Shunting mode.

 4.4.20.1.11  When in Passive Shunting mode, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board shall not manage level 
transitions. However, an immediate level transition order or a conditi onal level 
transition order shall be stored and shall be evaluated only when another mode than 
Shunting or Passive Shunting has been entered  (i.e. when the Shunting movement is 
terminated ). 
4.4.20.1.12  When receiving a communication session establishment order, the ER TMS/ETCS on -
board in Passive Shunting mode shall not establish the communication session, but 
shall store the RBC ID/phone number information.  
4.4.20.1.13  When in Passive Shunting mode, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board shall not manage RBC -
RBC hand -over, except for storing the  RBC ID/phone number information given at the 
RBC/RBC border.  
4.4.20.1.14  Note: for the list of main functions related to this mode, refer to chapter 4.5 “Modes 
and on-board  functions” . 
4.4.20.1.15  In case of balise group message consistency error (refer to 3.16.2.4.4 and 3.16.2. 5.1), 
the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment shall not command the service brake.  
4.4.20.2  Used in levels  
4.4.20.2.1  Used in all levels: Level 0, level 1, level 2, level 3 and level NTC 
4.4.20.3  Responsibilities  
4.4.20.3.1  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment of an engine in Passive Shunting mode has 
no responsibility for the train protection.  
4.4.20.3.2  The notion of responsibility of the driver is not relevant for the Passive Shunting mode.  
4.4.20.3.3  Note : The leading engine is responsible for the movement of the train. It is then the 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment of the le ading engine that is fully/partially/not 
responsible for the train protection, with respect to its mode.

 4.6 Transitions between modes  
4.6.1  Symbols  
4.6.1.1  The indication “ 4>” means: The condition n°4 must be fulfilled to trigger the transition  
4.6.1.2  From the mode located in the column  
4.6.1.3  To the mod e that is indicated by the arrow “ >”. 
4.6.1.4  Each transition from a given mode receives a priority order (indicated by “ -px-”, x is the 
priority order) to avoid a conflict between the different transitions when they occur at 
the same time (i.e. in the same clock cycle). P1 has a higher priority than P2.  
4.6.1.5  Some transitions have received the same priority order. This has been decided when it 
is obvious that these transitions cannot occur at the same time, and so can never lead 
to a conflicting situation (for example, the RBC cannot give in the same time a MA for 
FS and a MA for OS to a given engine, this is why the transition “from SR to FS” and 
the transition “from SR to OS” have the same priority order).  
4.6.1.6  "16, 17, 18" means "16 or 17 or 18".

 4.7 DMI depending on modes  
4.7.1  Introduction  
4.7.1.1  The DMI is an interface  that allows the direct exchange of information between the 
driver and the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment.  The indirect exchange of information 
done v ia the train interface (e.g. a driver’s action on the service brake used for the 
service brake feedback, opening/closing the desk) is not part of the DMI.  
4.7.1.2  The device(s) used to select “ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment powered/unpowered” 
is (are) not part of th e DMI . 
4.7.1.3  The device(s) used to select /indicate  “ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment isolated/not 
isolated” is (are) part of the DMI . 
4.7.1.4  Intentionally deleted . 
4.7.1.5  Information (input or output) only relevant for National System  and not originated by 
the ERTMS/ETCS on -board  is not included in the following section.  
4.7.2  DMI versus Mode Table  
4.7.2.1.1  X = active: For a  DMI output, this means that the output information shall be shown to 
the driver when the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment is in the mode indicated in the 
column. For a  DMI input , this means that it shall be possible for the driver to enter this 
information when the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment is in the mode indicated in the 
column).  
4.7.2.1.2  A = available: This means that the input/output shall become active ONLY if another 
condition(s) is (are) fulfilled. This condition(s) are not described here.  
4.7.2.1.3  Grey cells: availability and meaning defined by national system.  
4.7.2.1.4  NA = Not Applicable: This concerns the modes SF and IS in which the DMI inputs and 
outputs cannot be determined.

 4.8 Acceptance of received information  
4.8.1  Introduction  
4.8.1.1  The aim of this chapter is to give an overview o f which information is accepted  or 
reject ed depending on the state of the on -board (level, mode) and the nature of the 
received info rmation ( transmission medium, type of information: infill  or non -infill). 
4.8.1.2  The following sections have to be interpreted by applying the filters as shown in Figure 
3. The first filter is detailed in section 4.8.3 “Accepted information depending on the 
level and transmission media”, the third filter in section 4.8.4 “Accepted information 
depending on the modes”.  
4.8.1.3  If a message contains level transition information, any ot her information in that 
message shall be evaluated considering  the level transition information.  
4.8.1.3.1  Information received in the same message as an immediate level transition order or a 
conditional level transition order that causes a level transition  shall be  evaluated first 
considering the on -board currently operated level, as if a level transition order for 
further location had been received (i.e. conditions [1] , [2] or [6]  of Figure 3, if applied, 
shall be automatically fulfilled). Then, if relevant, it sha ll be immediately extracted from 
the buffer and re -evaluated according to the new selected level.  
4.8.1.4  Note:  As shown in Figure 3, information stored following an announcement of a 
change of level, is re -checked for acceptance when the level has changed. This 
implies that, when the level changes, the mode is - for a short moment – still 
unchanged, until the stored information has been processed. The consequence for the 
Third Filter is that information needs to be accepted for this short period also in modes 
in which this information is otherwise useless.  
4.8.1.5  If a message contains infill information, this latter shall be evaluated considering  all 
other non -infill information in that message.  
4.8.1.6  When evaluating trackside information received by radio or when re -evaluating  a set of 
information released from the transition buffer, linking information, if any, shall be 
evaluated prior to any other location related information .

 4.8.2  Assumptions  
4.8.2.1  The following tables shall be applied assum ing that: 
a) the information complies with the system version checks (see section 3.17.3) and 
with the data consistency checks.(see section 3.16)  
b) the direction for which the information is valid matches the current train orientation, 
or the balise group crossing direction (for SL , PS and SH engines).(see section 
3.6.3)  
c) In levels 2/3, it is assumed that the “RBC” information which is marked “A” 
(Accepted) comes from the supervi sing RBC (see RBC/RBC handover). If this 
information is received from the “Accepting” RBC while the “Handing Over” RBC is 
still responsible, it is stored onboard until the RBC transition is performed  
exception 1: the information “Acknowledgement of Train Da ta”, “ Trackside 
constituent system version ”, "Initiation of Communication Session" , "Session 
Management" and “Acknowledgement of Session Termination" shall be immediately 
accepted.  
exception2:  the information “Co -operative shortening of MA” , “Revocation of  
Emergency Stop” and “LSSMA display toggle on/off order” shall be rejected.  
d) to check exception [4] in 4.8.3, the track description is referred to the LRBG . 
e) the information from balise is received while no reverse movement is performed 
(see clause 3.14.3.6)  
4.8.2.2  Regarding 4.8.2.1 a): In case a balise is missed or a balise telegram cannot be 
decoded, the information “ Inhibition of balise group message consistency reaction”  is 
only used by the on -board equipment to inhibit the service brake reaction, while the 
balise group message is rejected. If all the telegrams from a balise group are correctly 
read, the information “ Inhibition of balise group message consistency reaction” , if 
received, shall be ignored by the on -board equipment. Therefore this information need 
not to be referre d to i n the following tables.  
4.8.2.3  In case a balise telegram contains the information VBC marker and a country/region 
identity that both match a stored VBC, the whole balise telegram is ignored and any 
further check in relation to this balise te legram is irrelevant (refer to 3.15.9. 3 b)). 
Otherwise the information VBC marker, if included in a consistent balise group 
message , shall al ways be ignored by the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment and  need 
not to be referred to in the following tables . 
4.8.2.4  Note: with the exception of the data that is forwarded to a National System through the 
STM interface (see 3.15.6 and SUBSET -035), what will happen to the data to be used 
by applications outside ERTMS/ETCS  (e.g. whether it is discarded, forwarded to an 
external application, processed by a national function…) is outside the scope of this 
specification and is assumed as not being part of the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 
functionality .

 4.8.5  Handling of transi tion buffer in case of level transition announcement or 
RBC/RBC handover  
4.8.5.1  If an order to switch to level NTC, 1, 2 or 3  at a further location has been received , the 
ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment shall be able to store in a transition buffer (see 
figure 3, fi rst filter) three  sets of information obtained from three  filtered messages.  
4.8.5.2  If a RBC transition order has been received and the Handing Over RBC is still the 
supervising one, the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment shall be able to store in a 
transition buffer ( see figure 3, second filter) three sets of information obtained from 
three filtered messages from the Accepting RBC.  
4.8.5.2.1  Note: t he term “set of information” refers to the part of a message being stored in the 
transition buffer  (i.e. information which is neithe r accepted nor rejected immediately) 
according to the conditions stated in 4.8.3.1 [1] and [2] (for level transition) or 
according to 4.8.2. 1c (for RBC/RBC handover) . 
4.8.5.3  In case three sets of information are already stored in the transition buffer , any new se t 
to be stored shall replace the oldest one currently stored.  
4.8.5.4  The sets of information stored in the transition buffer shall be deleted : 
a) in case  the level transition order is deleted or overwritten by another level transition 
order for a different level, OR  
b) in case  the RBC transition order is deleted or overwritten by an order to switch to 
another Accepting RBC , OR 
c) in case the communication session with the RBC that provided the stored 
information is terminated  
4.8.5.5  At the same time the level transition is perfor med or at the same time the Accepting 
RBC becomes the supervising one, the sets of information stored in the transition 
buffer shall be released and re -evaluated in the sequence they have been received.  
4.8.5.6  This sequential re -evaluation of all the released inf ormation shall be a prerequisite to 
any use by the on -board equipment (e.g. it will lead neither to an intermediate change 
of mode nor to a change of information displayed to the driver) and shall obey the 
following principles:  
a) Starting from the informatio n currently used by on -board at the moment the 
level/RBC transition is effective, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall 
determine the new information for train supervision, by performing sequential 
updates from the information released from the transitio n buffer, if accepted.  
b) For each information update related to a re -evaluated set of information, the same 
rules shall apply as to information update related to new information accepted 
outside a level/RBC transition context.

Chapter 4 : Modes and Transitions  Page 68/74 
 c) The information resulting from this sequential update shall then be used by the 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment . 
4.8.5.7  Accepting re -evaluated Conditional Emergency Stop information according to table 
4.8.3 implies that the accepted Conditional Emergency Stop information may be 
accepted or rejec ted in a further step (see clause 3.10.2.2) depending on the given 
stop location. This decision , based on the comparison between the min safe front end 
position of the train at the time the message was received and the given stop location,  
shall be  conside red part of the evaluation process as it affects the further re -evaluation 
of information stored in the transition buffer (see clause 3.10.2.4).  
4.8.5.7.1  Note: For the case of the Unconditional Emergency Stop information accepting the 
information according to table  4.8.3 will always lead to the train being tripped (see 
clause  3.10.2.3) when re -evaluation of the transition buffer is completed . Information 
accepted during re -evaluation of information stored in the transition buffer can then be 
affected on transition t o TR mode according to conditions in Table 4.10.  
4.8.5.8  Note: The requirement to acknowledge an Emergency Stop information according to 
clause 3.10.1.4, i.e., communicating to the RBC if the information has been accepted 
(Conditional or Unconditional Emergency St op) or rejected because the train has 
passed the stop location (Conditional Emergency Stop only) , applies to the time when 
the information is used , immediately after the sequential update has been completed.  
Regards acknowledging the reception of an emerge ncy stop message, as for any 
other information received from trackside, see clause 3.16.3.5.

 5.3 Introduction  
5.3.1  Scope and Purpose  
5.3.1.1  This document defines the procedures that are necessary for interoperability with in the 
scope of ERTMS/ETCS.  
5.3.1.2  Each procedure is defined by a set of mandatory requirements and , where convenient, 
is illustrated by a flowchart.  
5.3.1.3  In case the condition(s) in chapter 4 triggering a mode transition is(are) fulfilled, this 
transition shall be ex ecuted even if not shown in the chapter 5 procedures . 
5.3.1.3.1  Note: Such a mode transition could lead to exit ing a procedure immediately (e. g. cut 
off power of on -board equipment, isolation of on -board equipment).  
5.3.1.4  National operation rules (outside of ERTMS/ETCS) are also excluded, but may be 
applied by the railways in addition to the procedures as long as interoperability is 
retained.  
5.3.2  Definitions  
5.3.2.1  Procedures  
A procedure defines the required reaction of the ERTMS/ETCS entities (subsystems 
and components) to either i nformation exchanged between ERTMS/ETCS entities or 
events (triggered by external entities or internal events). The procedures focus on the 
required change in status and mode of the described ERTMS/ETCS entities.  
5.3.2.2  Entities  
The procedures define the required  system behaviour on a context level, i. e. the 
entities that are used to define the procedures are for example: the on -board 
equipment, the trackside equipment (RBC/Balise), the driver.  
5.3.2.3  States  
States are situations of an ETCS subsystem with a specific set  of available functions 
and a specific set of events that may start or terminate the state. A state remains 
active as long as the conditions to trigger the transition to a succeeding state are not 
completely satisfied.  
Note 1: one mode of operation may in clude several states for the on -board equipment.  
Note 2: A new state is only created, if the behaviour of the system differs from another 
one. Possession of information (e. g. location information) or not does not force 
branching in states.

 Transitions define the rules for passing from one state to another. A transition is 
triggered by a set of conditions which has to be fulfilled in a defined order or at the 
same time.  When a transition refers to a driver’s selection, it means that the conditio ns 
to enable the corresponding button on the DMI were fulfilled.

 5.4 Procedure Start of mission  
5.4.1  Introduction  
5.4.1.1  The driver may have to start a mission:  
a) Once the train is awake, OR  
b) Once shunting movements are finished, OR  
c) Once a mission is ended, OR  
d) Once a slave engine becomes a leading engine.  
5.4.1.2  The common point of all these situations is that the ERTMS/ETCS on -board is in 
Stand -By mode, but the Start of Mission will be different, since some data may be 
already stored on -board, depending on the previous situation.  
5.4.1.3  Once the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment is in Stand -By mode, the start of mission 
is not the only possibility, the engine may be come  remote controlled ( i.e. the on -board 
switches to Sleeping  mode ). 
5.4.2  Status of data stored in the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment  
5.4.2.1  At the beginning of the Start of Mission procedure, the data required may be in one of 
three states:  
a) “valid” (the stored value is known to be correct)  
b) “Invalid” (the stored value may be wrong)  
c) “Unknown”  (no stored value available)  
5.4.2.2  This refers to the follo wing data: Driver ID, ERTMS/ETCS level, RBC ID/phone 
number, Train Data, Train Running Number, Train Position ( see 3.6.1.3 ). 
5.4.2.3  Note 1 :  The status of data in relation to the previous and the actual mode is described 
in chapter 4, section "What happens to sto red information when entering a mode".  
5.4.2.4  Note 2 : The change of status of data in course of the procedure is shown in the table 
in section 5.4.3.3 . 
5.4.3  Table of requirements for “Start of Mission” procedure  
5.4.3.1  The ID numbers in the table  are used for the representation of the procedure in form of 
a flow chart in section 5.4.4 .

 5.4.3.2  Procedure  
ID # Requirements  
S0 The Start of Mission procedure shall be engaged when the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 
equipment is in Stand -By mode with a desk open and no communication session is 
established  or is being established . 
S1 Depending on the status of the Driver -ID, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall 
request the driver to enter the Driver -ID (if the Driver -ID is unknown) or sha ll request 
the driver to revalidate or re -enter the Driver -ID (if the Driver -ID is invalid).  
The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall offer the driver the possibility to 
enter /re-validate  (depending on the status) the Train running number.  
The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall also offer the driver the possibility to 
set/remove a Virtual Balise Cover.  
Once the Driver -ID is entered or revalidated (E1) (possibly further to the Train running 
number entry/revalidation and/or to Virtual Balise Cover setting/rem oval), the process 
shall go to D2 
D2 If both the stored position and the stored level  are valid, the process shall go to D3

the Mobile Terminal(s) and:  
 If this list is empty ( E3) the process shall go to A29 
 If the driver selects a new Radio Network ID  from the proposed list, the 
registration of the Mobile Terminal(s) to this new Radio Network shall be  
ordered and  the status of the RBC -ID/phone number shall be immediately set 
to “unknown”.  
If at least one Mobile Terminal is registered to a Radio Network , the ERTMS/ETCS 
on-board equipment shall offer the following options to the driver  for the RBC -
ID/pho ne number : 
 Only if the status of the RBC -ID/phone number is “invalid": order the 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment to use  the last stored RBC -ID/phone

if the position is still invalid, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board shall delete the train 
position data (new status: “unknown”)  
b) only at S1 0 and S20,  to re-enter the Driver -ID 
c) only at S10 and S20, to re-enter the “Train running number”  
d) only at S20,  to re-enter the Train data . If the driver chooses to do so , then the 
process shall go to S12.  
e) only at S10 and S20, to re -enter  the Level. If the dr iver chooses to do so, t hen the 
process shall go to S2  
f) only at S20, to select “Non Leading”. If the driver chooses to do so, then the 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall immediately switch to Non Leading mode 
and, if the position is still invalid, the ERTM S/ETCS on -board shall delete the train 
position data (new status: “unknown”).  
g) only at S20, to select “Shunting”. If the driver chooses to do so, then the process 
shall go to the procedure “Shunting initiated by driver” and, if the position is still 
invalid , the ERTMS/ETCS on -board shall delete the train position data (new status: 
“unknown”). If, in level 2 or 3, the RBC rejects the request for Shunting, the process 
shall go back to S20.  
h) only at S10, if valid Train Data is available, to select “Start”. If th e driver chooses to 
do so:  
 if the level is 0, then the process shall go to S23.  
 if the level is NTC, then the process shall go to S22.  
 if the level is 1, then the process shall go to S24.

 5.5 Procedure End of Mission  
5.5.1  Introduction  
5.5.1.1  End of mission refers to the situation where the trackside stops to authorise the 
movement of a unit. End of mission is initiated by the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 
equipment when entering specific modes (see below).  
5.5.2  Entry to Mode Considered as an End of Mission:  
5.5.2.1  Stand -By mode  
5.5.2.1.1  From FS, LS, OS, UN, NL,  SR, PT, RV or SN mode, the entry of the ERT MS/ETCS 
on-board equipment into the Stand -by mode is considered as an End of Mission  
5.5.2.1.2  Note: While in SN mode (level  NTC), some other conditions to end the mission may 
depend on the National System . 
5.5.2.1.3  The entry of the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment into the S tand-by mode, from PT 
mode, is only considered as an End of Mission if there was an on -going mission . 
5.5.2.2  Sleeping mode  
5.5.2.2.1  The entry of the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment into the Sleeping mode is 
considered as an End of Mission.  
5.5.2.2.1.1  Note: The transition to Sleeping mod e is always made from the Stand -By mode 
(refer to chapter 4, transition between modes). If the end of mission has been already 
executed in Stand -by mode no further end of mission is required.  
5.5.2.3  Shunting mode  
5.5.2.3.1  The entry of the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment int o the Shunting mode, from FS, 
LS, OS, SR, SN or UN mode, is considered as an End of Mission.  
5.5.2.3.2  The entry of the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment into the Shunting mode, from PT 
mode, is only considered as an End of Mission if there was an on -going mission.  
5.5.2.3.3  Note : While in SN mode (level  NTC), some other conditions to end the mission may 
depend on the National System . 
5.5.3  End of Mission Procedure  
5.5.3.1  The procedure comprises the following steps  
5.5.3.1.1  Step 1 - MA, Track Description Data and Train Data may be deleted (mode

 5.7 Entry in Shunting with Order from Trackside  
5.7.1  General Requirements  
5.7.1.1  This procedure is used to allow the entry of a train into a shunting area.  
5.7.1.2  Note: The shunting area, pos sibly including a “safety envelope”, can be already 
occupied by shunting units, not controlled by the trackside. It is therefore possible that 
the train shall enter into the shunting area in OS mode. The switch to OS is performed 
according to the relevant procedure.   
5.7.1.3  The order to switch to SH mode shall be given by means of a mode profile, optionally 
with a list of balises  groups , which the train can pass when the ERTMS/ETCS on -
board equipment is in shunting mode.  
5.7.1.4  The switch to shunting, if the transition to shunting was ordered by trackside, requires 
a driver acknowledgement, according to the specifications below.  
5.7.1.5  When the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment has switched to Shunting mode, End of 
Mission, according to chapter 5.5.2.3 , is performed.  
5.7.2  Shunting is requested for the current location (from modes different from 
Stand By and Post Trip)  
5.7.2.1  In a level 1 area, or at the border from a level 0 to a level 1 area, the beginning of the 
shunting area can be the location where a balise gro up is installed. In level 2/3 it is 
possible to send an ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment the order to switch to shunting 
at the current location.  
5.7.2.2  Shunting is requested for the current location means that, according to the mode 
profile received the max safe fr ont end of the train is at or in advance of the location for 
which switching to SH mode is requested.  
5.7.2.3  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall switch immediately to SH mode and a 
request for acknowledgement shall be displayed to the driver (refer to SRS cha pter 4, 
transitions between modes).  
5.7.2.4  If the driver does not acknowledge within the driver acknowledgement time (refer to 
Appendix A3.1) after the change to SH mode, the service brake command shall be 
triggered. The command shall be released as soon as the d river acknowledges (unless 
the command was triggered also for other reasons).  
5.7.3  Shunting is requested for a further location  
5.7.3.1  An order to switch to SH at a further location can be sent  
a) in a level 1 area by a balise group,

 b) in a level 2 or 3 area by the RBC.  
5.7.3.2  A request for acknowledgement shall be displayed to the driver, when the following two 
conditions are fulfilled:  
a) the distance between the estimated front end of the train and the beginning of 
shunting area is shorter than a value, contained in the mode profi le 
b) the speed is lower than the Shunting mode speed limit (National Value, or value 
given in the mode profile)  
5.7.3.3  Once the request for acknowledgement is displayed, it shall not be taken back, even if 
the above conditions are no more fulfilled (e.g., the train  accelerates).  
5.7.3.4  Until the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment has switched to SH mode , according to 
the mode profile, the beginning of the shunting area shall be considered either as the 
EOA (keeping the SvL given by the MA) or as both the EOA and SvL (instead of  the 
EOA and SvL given by the MA), with no release speed.  
5.7.3.5  When the driver acknowledges, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall 
immediately switch to SH mode (refer to chapter 4, transitions between modes).  
5.7.3.6  If the max safe front end of the train reaches th e beginning of the shunting area 
according the mode profile and the driver has not yet acknowledged, the 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall switch immediately to SH mode and a 
request for acknowledgement shall be displayed to the driver (refer to SRS chap ter 4, 
transitions between modes).  
5.7.3.7  If, in this case, the driver does not acknowledge within the driver acknowledgement 
time (refer to Appendix A3.1) after the change to SH mode, the service brake 
command shall be triggered. The command shall be released as  soon as the driver 
acknowledges (unless the command was triggered also for other reasons).  
5.7.4  Shunting from Stand By or Post Trip mode  
5.7.4.1  When performing a SoM or a Train Trip procedure and when the current level is 2 or 3, 
the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment can  receive a mode profile giving an Shunting 
area which the train has already entered with its max safe front end. In this case, the 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall first require an acknowledgement from the 
driver.  
5.7.4.2  When the driver acknowledges, the ERTMS /ETCS on -board equipment shall perfo rm 
transition to Shunting mode.

 5.8 Procedure Override  
5.8.1  Introduction  
5.8.1.1  In specific degraded  situations (for example in the case of a failed signal, failed track 
circuit, failed point…), railways allow a train to pass its EOA .  
5.8.1.2  For ERTMS/ETCS, passing an EOA  can be required in degraded situations, e.g.  
 In level 2/3, if a train is stopped without MA in a location where radio is unavailable 
(e.g. after having received an emergency message, or after a train trip).  
 In level 2/3, if a train is stopped at the border between two adjacent RBCs (e.g. the 
interface between RBCs is unavailable).  
 In level 2/3 , if a train is stopped after having passed the border between two 
adjacent RBCs (e.g. the connection to the Accepting RBC cannot be established).  
 In level 2/3, if the RBC is unable to give a permission to run (e.g. lost connection 
with the interlocking)  
 In level 1, if a signal cannot show a proceed aspect (e.g., signal failure, route 
cannot be set)  
 In level 1, if a train is stopped without MA (e.g. after the MA has been shortened 
due to a time -out). 
5.8.1.3  In level 0 /NTC  areas, passing a signal at danger is only a national procedure. The 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment is not involved in this procedure, since it does not 
supervise the train movements.  
5.8.1.4  In ERTMS equipped areas (level 1, 2 or 3), locations where the train shall stop are 
supervised by the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment. Receiving an order from the 
signalman to pass the EOA , the driver must then be able to inhibit this supervision.  
5.8.1.4.1  Note:  The driver must not use the “Override” procedure unless authorised by trackside 
personnel. This authorisation  is covered  by operational procedures.  
5.8.1.5  If an EOA must be passed between announcement and execution of the level 
transition from an unfitted area (level 0) or from an area fitted with a National System 
(level NTC) to an ERTMS equipped area (level 1, 2, 3), the signalm an gives the order 
to the driver to select “override”.  
5.8.1.6  Note : Passing the EOA  by using this procedure the driver is fully responsible for the 
train driving. Therefore Staff Responsible mode is entered when the driver selects 
“override”.  
5.8.1.7  In addition the proc edure allows to avoid a train trip when passing a balise group:  
a) transmitting "stop in SR mode"  
b) not contained in the list of expected balises in SR mode

 c) transmitting "stop in SH mode"  
d) not contained in the list of expected balises in SH mode"  
e) Intentionally deleted  
5.8.1.8  Further, the Override procedure allows a train in SR mode reaching the end of the SR 
distance to proceed (see also 4.4.11.1.4 ) 
5.8.2  Selection of “Override”  
5.8.2.1  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall allow the driver to select “Override” (i.e. 
the “Override ” button becomes available) only when:  
a) The train speed is under or equal to the speed limit for triggering the “override” 
function (national value) AND  
b) The current mode is Full Supervision, Limited Supervision, On Sight, Staff 
Responsible, Shunting, Unfitt ed, Post Trip, Stand By (in level 2/3 only)  or S N 
(National  System)  AND  
c) Validated Train Data is available (except when already in Shunting mode).  
5.8.2.2  Intentionally deleted . 
5.8.2.3  The “Override” procedure shall be triggered when selected by the driver.  
5.8.3  Once the “Over ride” procedure has been triggered  
5.8.3.1  The mode shall change as follows:  
a) If the current mode is Full Supervision, Limited Supervision, On Sight, Stand -By or 
Post Trip, the mode shall immediately switch to the Staff Responsible (SR) mode (if 
the mode is already  SR it remains unchanged)  
b) If the current mode is Shunting the mode shall remain unchanged  
c) If the current mode is Unfitted (level 0 area) or S N (level NTC area ) the mode shall 
only change to Staff Responsible when the level changes to 1,2 or 3 (refer to SRS  
chapter 4, transitions between modes)  
5.8.3.1.1  If the mode, when activating Override, is OS , LS or FS, the former EOA  shall be 
retained. If the mode is SB or PT, the current position of the train front shall be 
considered as the former EOA . 
5.8.3.1.2  Note: This former EOA  will be used as a Trip condition if the Override function  is no 
longer active. Any further activation of the Override in SR mode has no effect on the 
former EOA . 
5.8.3.1.3  The former EOA  shall be deleted  if: 
a) the train reads the information “stop in SR mode” from a ba lise group OR

 b) SR mode is left.  
5.8.3.2  Note 1:  In level 2, 3, if radio communication is available, the RBC is only informed that 
the Override has been triggered by means of the reported mode change (if there is 
any) 
5.8.3.3  Note 2: In level 2,3, if the ERTMS/ETCS - onboard  equipment is able to report the 
mode change to the RBC, the RBC may transmit limits for the distance to run in SR 
mode (overriding the national value), a  list of balises to be passed in SR mode (refer 
to chapter 4, Staff Responsible mode)  
5.8.3.4  Note  3: In leve l 2,3, the transition to SR mode triggered by selecting Override revokes 
all emergency stop orders previously received.  
5.8.3.5  In SR mode the driver may modify the value of the SR mode speed limit and of the 
distance to run in SR mode (refer to chapter 4, Staff R esponsible mode)  
5.8.3.6   The train trip shall be inhibited (suppression of the transition to the Trip mode), and 
only in level 0, 1, 2, 3, the MRSP shall include the Override function related Speed 
Restriction  (see 3.11.10) as long as the Override function is act ive. 
5.8.3.7  The status “override active” shall be indicated to the driver.  
5.8.3.8  As long as the Override function is active, new SR distance information received from 
EUROLOOP shall be rejected.  
5.8.3.9  When “Override” is selected and Override is already active , the supervisio n of the time 
and distance (see 5.8.4.1 a) and b)) for train trip suppression  shall be re -started . 
5.8.4  End of Override procedure  
5.8.4.1  The Override procedure  shall end when at least one of the following conditions is 
fulfilled:  
a) The "max. time for train trip suppress ion when Override function is triggered" 
(national value) elapses after Override has been selected , OR 
b) The train has run more than the "distance for train trip suppression when Override 
function is triggered" (national value)  after Override has been select ed, OR 
c) The former EOA  has been passed with the min safe  antenna position (calculated 
by subtracting distance between active EUROBALISE antenna and the front end of 
the train from the min safe front end position), OR  
d) The train passes a balise group giving “stop in SR” or “stop in SH” information, OR  
e) The train passes a balise group giving proceed information (i.e., MA with no 
signalling related speed restriction of value zero)  
f) In level 2,3, an MA is received from the RBC

 5.9 Procedure On -Sight  
5.9.1  General Requirements  
5.9.1.1  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall be in On Sight mode before the train 
reaches the beginning of the On Sight area or, at the latest, when the train reaches the 
beginning of the On Sight area.  
5.9.1.2  An acknowledgement for running in On Sight mode shall be requested from the driver. 
The conditions of the acknowledgement are specified below.  
5.9.2  On Sight is reque sted for current location (from modes different from 
Stand By and Post Trip)  
5.9.2.1  In a level 1 area, the beginning of the On Sight area can be the balise (group) that 
gives the Mode Profile. When the train passes the balise group and receives this 
information, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall immediately switch to On 
Sight mode.  
5.9.2.2  In a level 2 or 3 area, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment can receive a mode 
profile giving an On Sight area which the train has already entered with its max safe 
front end. In th is case, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall immediately switch 
to On Sight mode.  
5.9.2.3  The driver must acknowledge the On Sight mode. A request of acknowledgement shall 
be displayed to the driver.  
5.9.2.4  If the driver has not acknowledged after the driver acknowle dgement time (refer to 
Appendix A3.1), the service brake command shall be triggered. The brake command is 
released when the driver acknowledges, except if brakes are also applied for another 
reason(s).  
5.9.2.5  Note : Once in On Sight mode, the speed supervision is such that the train speed 
cannot exceed the OS mode speed limit. If, when entering the On Sight mode, the 
train speed was higher than the OS mode  speed limit (because a higher speed was 
allowed in Full Supervision mode , in Limited Supervision mode  or in St aff Responsible 
mode) then a service/emergency brake command could be immediately triggered, 
independently of the acknowledgement of the driver, but because of the On Sight 
supervision (see Figure 4).

Supervision mode by giving with the previous MA an E OA (or a L OA = OS mode  speed  
limit) at the location  of transition to On Sight mode. In Staff Responsible mode, lateral 
signals (if available) can also order the driver to decrease the train speed.  
5.9.2.7  If the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment is already in OS mode when receiving the 
OS mode profile, no further ackn owledgement shall be requested from the driver.  
5.9.3  On Sight is requested for a further location  
5.9.3.1  The beginning of the On Sight area can be a location that the train has not reached 
yet. This occurs when:  
a) In a level 1 area, a balise group gives a Mode Profile w ith an On Sight area that is 
located at a further location.  
b) In a level 2 or 3 area, the RBC gives a Mode Profile with an On Sight area that is 
located at a further location.  
5.9.3.2  A request for acknowledgement shall be displayed to the driver when the following 
conditions are fulfilled:  
a)  The distance between the estimated front end of the train and the beginning of On 
Sight area is shorter than a value, contained in the mode profile.   
b) The speed is lower than the On Sight mode speed limit (national value, or valu e 
given in the mode profile).  
c) The current mode is not On Sight  
5.9.3.3  Note : The  first 2 conditions define the “rectangle of acknowledgement”.  
5.9.3.4  Once the acknowledgement  request is displayed, it is not taken back if the train leaves 
the “rectangle of acknowledgemen t” (for example: because the train accelerates).

5.9.4  On Sight from Unfitted or S N mode  
5.9.4.1  The mode profile with regards to an OS area is only evaluated in levels 1,2,3, although 
the mode profile may have been received in level 0 (Unfitted mode) or NTC (SN 
mode). A transition to On Sight mode can therefore earliest occur  at a transition of 
level: from level 0 or NTC to level 1 or 2 or 3.

5.9.5.1  When performing a SoM or a Train Trip procedure and when th e current level is 2 or 3, 
the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment can receive a mode profile giving an On Sight 
area which the train has already entered with its max safe front end. In this case, the

the transition to On Sight mode.”  
5.9.6  Exit of On Sight mode  
5.9.6.1  General rule  
5.9.6.1.1  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment exits the On Sight mode when the min safe 
front en d of the train passes the end of the On Sight area.  
5.9.6.2  First case: The On Sight area ends at the EOA of the current MA  
5.9.6.2.1  This occurs when the end of the On Sight area that is given by the Mode Profile has 
the same location as the EOA of the related MA.  
5.9.6.2.2  In this case, the train must receive a new Movement Authority to be able to exit the On 
Sight area.  
5.9.6.2.3  Note: In an On Sight area there is no guarantee for the RBC that the track in front of 
the supervised train is free. Therefore, if the next block section is free, t he RBC has 
nevertheless to ensure that there is no train/vehicle between the train and the end of 
the On Sight area. This information  
 can be given  to the RBC by the signalman or any other trackside means  (outside 
scope of  ERTMS/ ETCS ), or 
 can be inquired by the RBC by means of the following mechanism: the RBC sends 
a “track ahead free” request which the ERTMS/ ETCS on -board equipment 
displays to the driver. If the driver confirms that the track is free up to the end of the 
current section, the ERTMS/ ETCS on-board equipment will transmit this 
information to the RBC.  
5.9.6.2.4  Note: Receiving the “track ahead free” information, the RBC may be able to transmit 
an MA from the current position of the train, e.g., for Full Supervision (refer to SRS 
chapter 4, transitions between modes).  
5.9.6.3  Second case: The On Sight area ends before the EOA of the current MA

 5.9.6.3.1  In this case, the current Movement Authority already allows the train to exit the On 
Sight area.

 5.10 Level Transitions  
5.10.1  General requi rements  
5.10.1.1  Every level transition border to levels 2, 3, or NTC shall be announced to the 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment via balise group or via the RBC.  
5.10.1.2  A level transition announcement to the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall 
consist of an order to execute the level transition at a further location corresponding to 
the border.  
5.10.1.3  When the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment receives a level transition 
announcement, and if this announcement will result in a change of the on -board level, 
it shall immediately inform the  driver about the announced level transition.  
5.10.1.3.1  Note: In a mixed level area the actual level of the on -board equipment may remain 
unchanged even though a level transition boundary is passed.  
5.10.1.4  At the level transition border a balise group shall be placed with an immediate level 
transition order or a conditional level transition order . 
5.10.1.4.1  Note : Balise groups are read in all levels and level transition orders and conditional 
level transition orders from balises are accepted independent of the level of operation. 
Also sleeping units read balise groups.

5.10.1.5  If the message from the border balise group is not received, the level transition shall 
still be executed when the  estimated front end passes the location given in the 
announcement.  
5.10.1.6  The on -board equipment shall manage only one level transition order at a time. 
Therefore a new level transition order shall replace a previously received order, i.e. if a 
new order to swit ch to a different level or to the same level but at a different location is 
received, before the action from the first order has been performed, only the last order 
shall be executed.

 5.10.1.6.1  In Shunting and Passive Shunting modes only one set of Level Transition Information 
shall be stored at a time. Therefore a set of Level Transition Information received shall 
replace any Level Transition Information already stored on -board.  
5.10.1.7  As soon as the announcement of the level transition has been received, some data 
(mainly  movement authority and track description data) from the transmission media of 
the new level shall be accepted, but shall not be used until the level transition is 
effective.  
5.10.1.7.1  Note: for the exhaustive list of accepted/rejected information, please refer to S RS 
chapter 4.8.  
5.10.1.7.2  Note: if only track description has been received from the new media without any 
movement authority, this track description still replaces the one previously received 
from the current media when the transition is performed.  
5.10.1.8  When the onboard  has performed the level transition, further data (mainly movement 
authority and track description data) received from the transmission media of the level

5.10.2.2  The level transition announcement and the immediate or conditional  level transition 
order at the border shall contain all the supported ERTMS/ETCS levels with a table of 
priority.  Even if only one level is permitted this is considered as a table of priority.  
5.10.2.2.1  Note: Level 0 is considered in the same way as the other levels . This means that, for 
example, when an area permits ERTMS/ETCS level 0, and is fitted with ERTMS/ETCS 
level 1 and 2, the track -side includes levels 0, 1 and 2 in a table of priority of supported 
levels in all level transition order s and conditional level transition orders  applying to that 
area. 
5.10.2.3  The table of priority shall list all the supported levels from the highest priority level to 
the lowest one.

 5.10.2.4.1  The on -board equipment shall consider an ERTMS/ETCS level as “Available for use” 
as follows:  
a) Level 2 or 3: the level is configured on -board and at least one Mobile Terminal is 
available on -board , i.e. the ETCS onboard has detected at least one Mobile 
Terminal in working condition, independently whether it is registered to a network or 
not. 
b) Level NTC: the concerned National System  is available on -board ( if an STM is 
used, refer to SUBSET -035 for further details ). 
c) Level 0 or 1: always.  
5.10.2.4.1.1  Note regarding a) and b): how the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment checks the 
availability of the Mobile Terminals or of the National System (in case no STM is used) 
is an implementation issue.  
5.10.2.4.2  Examples : The table of trackside supported levels gives 2,  NTC X, 1, NTC Y. If level 1 , 
0 and NTC X are “Available for use”, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board will select NTC X 
level. If level 1, 0 and NTC Y are “Available for use”, it will select level 1. If level 2 , 1 
and 0 are  “Available for use”, it will select level 2.  
5.10.2.5  When the onboard has selected the level it will switch to, it shall carry out the level 
transition as if it has received a level transition order to this level only i.e. it shall ignore 
the requirements related to transitions to the other levels.  
5.10.2.6  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall inform the driver about the selected level 
transition  only. 
5.10.2.7  If none of the ordered level(s) is available for use by the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 
equipment , it shall nevertheless make the transition, to the ordered level with the 
lowest priority.  
5.10.2.7.1  Justification:  The On -board equipment will then indicate the trackside level to the 
driver to allow him to select the correct procedures for degraded situations.

speed limits of the unequipped line.  
5.10.3.14  Conditional level transition order  
5.10.3.14.1  When the ERTMS /ETCS on -board equipment accepts a conditional level transition 
order the onboard shall check whether the current level is contained in the priority list 
of the conditional level transition order.  
5.10.3.14.2  If the current level is contained in the priority list of t he conditional level transition order, 
the onboard shall not change the level.  
5.10.3.14.3  If the current level is not contained in the priority list of the conditional level transition 
order, the onboard shall evaluate the conditional level transition order in the sa me way 
as an immediate level transition order  (see section 5.10.2) . 
5.10.3.14.4  In the same way as for a level transition order, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment 
shall store the table of ERTMS/ETCS levels supported by trackside.  
5.10.3.14.5  Note: The conditional level transition  order allows to check, whether a train operates in 
a permitted level e.g. following a start of mission after a cold movement. The level of a 
train driving in a permitted level will not be changed, regardless of the priority of the 
current level operated b y the train.  
5.10.3.15  Transition initiated by driver  
5.10.3.15.1  In addition to the level transitions ordered by trackside, it is also possible, at standstill, 
for the driver to change the ERTMS/ETCS level (refer to section 3.18.4.2).  
5.10.3.15.2  If the driver changes the level to 2 or 3 , the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall 
establish a communication session with the RBC:  
a) immediately if at least one Mobile Terminal is registered to a Radio Network and  a 
valid RBC ID/ phone number is available, OR

 b) once the driver has selected the RBC co ntact information  (by the same means  as 
for Start of Mission) , if either no Mobile Terminal is registered to a Radio Network or  
no valid RB C ID/phone number is available.  
5.10.3.15.2.1  Note regarding b): If the level transition leads to TR mode, the request for RBC 
contact information is only displayed once the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment is in 
PT mode.  
5.10.3.15.3  If the driver changes the level from 2 or 3 to any other, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 
equipment shall report the new level to the RBC if a communication session is 
establis hed. When receiving the level change report, the RBC shall order the 
communication session to be terminated.  
5.10.4  Acknowledgement of the level transition  
5.10.4.1  If defined so for the level transition (see table below), the driver shall be requested to 
acknowledge the transition  
a) when the max safe front end of the train has passed a trackside defined location in 
rear of the level transition border  
b) upon receipt of the order to switch to the new level immediately  
5.10.4.1.1  Exception: An ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment in NL mode shall  not require an 
acknowledgement from the driver.  
5.10.4.2  If the driver has not yet acknowledged within the driver acknowledgement time (refer to 
Appendix A3.1) after the level transition, a service brake command shall be initiated.  
5.10.4.3  The driver shall then acknowledg e the level transition in order to release the service 
brake command.  
5.10.4.4  For the following transitions marked as “YES”, the level transition announcement shall 
define the location from where an acknowledgement is required:

 5.12 Change of Train Orientation  
5.12.1  Introduction  
5.12.1.1  The scope of this procedure is the supervision of a train where the driver cont rols the 
train from the cab in the front of the train with the direction controller in FORWARD 
position.  
5.12.1.2  This implies that when the driver has to change the orientation of the train, he has to 
change the driving cab.  
5.12.1.3  The scope of this procedure is NOT shun ting movements, during which the driver 
change s the running direction of the train without leaving the cab, by changing the 
position of the direction controller from FORWARD to REVERSE.  
5.12.1.4  The scope of this procedure is NOT the backwards movement that is allo wed in Post 
Trip or in Reversing mode.  
5.12.2  The driver uses the same engine  (a mission is on -going)  
5.12.2.1  The situation is the following : The driver closes the desk A and leaves the cab A of the 
leading engine of the train, to go to cab B and open desk B of this same  engine.  
5.12.2.2  Desk A and desk B are connected to the same ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment.  
5.12.2.3  When the driver closes the desk A, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall 
immediately go to Stand -By mode, which  is considered as an end of mission (see “End 
of Mission” p rocedure)  
5.12.2.4  When the driver opens the desk B, the “Start of Mission” procedure is triggered.  
5.12.2.5  When the driver closes a desk and opens the other one of the same engine, the 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall be able to calculate the new train position 
data (t rain front position, train orientation), by use of the previous data.  
5.12.3  The driver leaves the engine to go to another one  
5.12.3.1  The described situation is the following : The train has two engines (engine A and 
engine B). The engine A is the leading engine. The eng ine B is a slave engine. Each 
engine has its own ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment.  
a) If engine B is remote controlled, its ETCS on -board equipment is in Sleeping mode.  
Note: The mode is entered when on -board equipment detects the presence of the 
"remote contro l" signal.

 b) If the slave engine is not remote controlled (Tandem operation) by the leading 
engine but  there is a driver who controls the engine, then the on -board equipment 
is in Non leading mode.  
c) If the engine B is not remote controlled (Tandem Shunting o peration) by the leading 
engine and there is no driver who controls the engine, then the on -board equipment 
is in Passive Shunting mode.  
5.12.3.2  Assumption: The train configuration does not change.  
a) When changing the train orientation, the leading engine A will bec ome the slave 
engine, and the slave engine B will become the leading engine.  
b) If before the change of train orientation engine B was in SL, afterwards engine A will 
be in SL mode; If before the change of train orientation engine B was in NL, 
afterwards engi ne A will be in NL mode ; If before the change of train orientation 
engine B was in PS, afterwards engine A will be in PS mode . 
5.12.3.3  Case "Engine B was in SL mode"  
5.12.3.3.1  The driver of engine A closes the desk, then the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment of 
engine A switche s to Stand -By mode. If the train has a mission, this is a end of mission 
(see “End of Mission” procedure)  
5.12.3.3.2  As soon as the remote control signal disappears, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 
equipment of engine B switches to Stand -By mode.  
5.12.3.3.3  Level 2,3: The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment of engine B shall open a 
communication session (if possible) and report the mode change to the RBC.  
5.12.3.3.4  When the driver opens a desk of engine B he triggers the "Start of Mission" procedure.  
5.12.3.4  Case "Engine B was in NL mode"  
5.12.3.4.1  The driver of engine A selects "Non Leading". The ERTMS/ETCS equipment switches 
to Non Leading mode.  
5.12.3.4.2  Once the non leading input signal is not received any more , the ERTMS/ETCS on -
board equipment of engine B will switch to Stand -By mode ( refer to SRS chapter 4, 
transitions betw een modes and chapter 5, “End of Mission” procedure).  
5.12.3.4.3  Because the desk is open, when the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment enters Stand -
By mode, the “Start of Mission” procedure is triggered.  
5.12.3.5  Case "Engine B was in PS mode"  
5.12.3.5.1  The driver of engine A selects "Conti nue Shunting on desk closure". The 
ERTMS/ETCS equipment switches to Passive Shunting mode once the driver closes 
the desk of engine A.

 5.12.3.5.2  The driver opens a desk in engine B, and ERTMS/ETCS equipment switches to 
Shunting mode.  
5.12.4  The driver uses the same engine (a Shunting movement is on -going)  
5.12.4.1  The situation is the following : while the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment is in 
Shunting mode, the driver closes the desk A and leaves the cab A of the Shunting 
engine, to go to cab B and open desk B of this same engine.  
5.12.4.2  Desk A and desk B are connected to the same ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment.  
5.12.4.2.1  Before closing the desk A, the driver enables the function “Continue Shunting on desk 
closure”. When the driver closes the desk A, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment 
shall immediately g o to Passive Shunting mode.  
5.12.4.2.2  When the driver opens the desk B, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall 
immediately switch back to Shunting mode.  
5.12.4.3  When the driver closes a desk and opens the other one of the same engine, the

 5.13 Train Reversing  
5.13.1.1  This procedure is intended to allow the fast reversal of movement of a train, to run 
away from a danger up to a “saf e” location.  
5.13.1.2  The area where initiation of reversing will be possible is announced to the 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment  by trackside (refer to 3.15.4.2 for details).   
5.13.1.3  While the train is at standstill inside the reversing permitted area, the driver shall be 
informed that reversing is possible  
5.13.1.4  If the ERTMS/ETCS onboard detects the driver’s intention to reverse (e.g. from a 
direction controller in reverse position) , the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall 
ask the driver to acknowledge transition to RV mode.  
5.13.1.5  If the driver acknowledges , the on -board equipment shall switch to RV mode  
5.13.1.6  Once in RV mode,  it shall be possible for the trackside to send a new permitted 
distance to run  and a new maximum speed . 
5.13.1.7  Once in RV mode, it shall also be possible for the trackside to  send, together with the 
new permitted distance to run and the maximum speed, a new reference location for 
the new permitted distance to run.  
5.13.1.8  Note: this new reference location is the end of a new reversing area given by trackside 
that the onboard will use only for the purpose of distance referencing.

 5.14 Joining / Splitting  
5.14.1  Definitions  
5.14.1.1  Definition for splitting: The “train to be split” is the train at standstill, waiting for being 
split. The “front train after splitting” refers to the front part of the train b efore splitting, 
the “new train after splitting”, refers to the other part.  
5.14.1.2  Definitions for joining: The “train to be joined” is the train at standstill, waiting for being 
joined. The “joining train” is the train performing the joining operation.  
5.14.2  Procedure  “Splitting”  
5.14.2.1  Step 1 - The electrical and mechanical links between the two trains must be removed 
(this is a national operational procedure, out of the scope of the SRS).  
5.14.2.1.1  Note: If splitting require s moving the two train parts apart from each other for a sma ll 
distance, this can be done even in SB mode  
5.14.2.2  Step 2a - If the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment which was supervising the train 
before splitting has not performed an end of mission for splitting, the driver must 
modify the Train Data such that it fits with the  new train composition after splitting.  
For level 2 or 3, the new train data is sent to the RBC (see SRS chapter 3 – Data Entry 
/ Modification Process)  
5.14.2.3  Step 2b - If an ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment of the "new train after splitting" was 
in SL mode before,  it will switch to SB mode once the remote control signal is not 
received any more (refer to SRS chapter 4, transitions between modes).  
For Level 2 or 3: The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall open a communication 
session (if possible) and report the mod e change to the RBC.  
5.14.2.4  Step - 2c If an ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment of the "new train after splitting" was 
in NL mode before, it will switch to SB mode once the non leading input signal is not 
received any more (refer to SRS chapter 4, transitions between m odes and chapter 5, 
“end of mission” procedure).  
5.14.2.5  The driver can then start a new mission with this “new train after splitting” (refer to the

Shunting movements, o r not moving the new train at all, are also possible.  
 
5.14.3  Procedure “Joining”  
5.14.3.1  Step 1 – The “joining train” must approach the “train to be joined”. This can be 
performed in SR, OS or SH mode (depending on the information available, and on the 
national procedur e for joining).

 5.14.3.2  Step 2 – The electrical and mechanical links between the two trains must be closed 
(vehicle dependent, outside the scope of the ETCS).  
5.14.3.3  Step 3a – If a former leading ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment remains leading and 
there was no end of missi on, the driver must modify the Train Data such that it fits with 
the new train composition. For level 2 or 3, the new train data is sent to the RBC (see 
SRS chapter 3 – Data Entry / Modification Process)  
5.14.3.4  Step 3b – If a former leading ERTMS/ETCS on -board eq uipment is to become slave 
equipment in SL mode, when closing the desk, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment 
will switch to SB mode (see SRS chapter 4, transitions between modes) and the end of 
mission procedure is executed (see “End of Mission” procedure). T ransition to SL 
mode is from SB mode.  
5.14.3.5  Step 3c: If a former leading ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment is to become slave 
equipment in NL mode, the driver selects NL mode (see SRS chapter 4, transitions 
between modes).

 5.15 RBC/RBC Handover  
5.15.1  Principles  
5.15.1.1  Every RBC/RBC handover shall be announced to the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 
equipment via a balise group or via the RBC.  
5.15.1.2  The handover announcement (i.e. RBC transition or der) to the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 
equipment shall consist of an order to contact the Accepting RBC (see 3.5.3.5.3) and 
to execute the handover at a further location corresponding to the border.  
5.15.1.2.1  In case of RBC/RBC handover including Radio Network border cross ing, 
ERTMS/ETCS trackside is responsible for the sequence of orders to register to the 
new Radio Network and to contact the "Accepting" RBC, according to the Radio 
Network ’s configuration.  
5.15.1.2.2  Note : In the following sections, "first" Mobile Terminal refers to the one used for 
communication session with “Handing Over” RBC and "second" Mobile Terminal to the 
one used for communication session with “Accepting” RBC.  
5.15.1.2.3  Note : In the following sections, Radio Networks are supposed to be overlapped.  
5.15.1.3  At the RBC/RBC border  a balise group with an order to execute the handover 
immediately shall be placed.  
5.15.1.3.1  Note : Balise groups are read in all levels and orders from balise groups are accepted 
independent of the level of operation. Also sleeping units read balise groups.  
5.15.1.4  If the m essage from the border balise group is not (yet) received, the handover shall 
still be executed when the train with its max safe front end passes the border location 
according to the announcement information.  
5.15.1.5  The on -board equipment shall manage only one RB C/RBC transition at a time, 
therefore a new transition order shall replace a previously received order.  
5.15.2  Case 1: Two communication sessions can be handled simultaneously  
5.15.2.1  Overview  
5.15.2.1.1  In the normal operation, the main functional steps needed for running from one  RBC 
area to another one are the following:  
a) Pre-announcement of the transition by the “Handing Over” RBC;  
b) Registration to the new Radio Network of second Mobile Terminal (optional) & 
Establishment of the radio communication session with the “Accepting” RBC ; 
c) Generation of movement authorities including the border;

g) Registration to the new Radio Network of first Mobile Te rminal (optional)  
5.15.2.2  Step by step description  
5.15.2.2.1  Pre-announcement  
5.15.2.2.1.1  When the “Handing Over” RBC generates a movement authority which reaches the 
border to another RBC area, it initiates the processes associated to the transition.  
5.15.2.2.1.2  The “Handing Over” RBC informs t he “Accepting” RBC about the RBC/RBC 
handover.  
5.15.2.2.2  Registration to the new Radio Network of second Mobile Terminal (optional) & 
Establishment of the radio communication session with “Accepting” RBC  
5.15.2.2.2.1  A radio communication session with the Accepting RBC is opene d by the on -board 
equipment based on the RBC transition order received from the “Handing Over” RBC 
or from balise group (refer to chapter 3, section "management of radio 
communication").  
5.15.2.2.2.2  In case of RBC/RBC handover including Radio Network border crossing, the 
registration to the new radio network of the second Mobile Terminal is completed 
before the RBC transition order is transmitted to the on -board equipment.  
5.15.2.2.3  Generation of MAs including the border  
5.15.2.2.3.1  The “Handing Over” RBC is responsible for establishing the  movement authority 
based on:  
a) Information from the trackside equipment and interlocking of its own area (for the 
part of route related information up to the border),  
b) Information from the “Accepting RBC” for the part of route related information in 
advance of the border.

the “Accepting” RBC.  
5.15.2.2.4.2  The “Handing Over” RBC forwards the announcement information to the 
“Accepting” RBC.  
5.15.2.2.4.2.1  Note:  Although not required for the case of two communication sessions, the 
forwarding of the announcement information  is executed because the “Handing Over” 
RBC has no knowledge if th e ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment can handle one or 
two communication sessions.  
5.15.2.2.5  Transfer of train supervision to “Accepting” RBC  
5.15.2.2.5.1  As soon as the on -board has sent to the “Accepting” RBC the position report, it 
considers to be supervised by the “Accepting” RBC  i.e. it uses information received 
from the “Accepting” RBC.  
5.15.2.2.5.2  When the “Accepting” RBC receives a position report from the on -board and detects 
that the max safe front end has passed the border, it takes over the responsibility and 
informs the “Handing Over ” RBC.

 5.19 Procedure Limited Supervision  
5.19.1  General Requirements  
5.19.1.1  The order to switch to Limited Supervision mode shall be given by means of a mode 
profile.  
5.19.1.2  An acknowledgement for running in Limited Supervision mode shall be requested from 
the driver. The conditions of the acknowledgement  are specified below.  
5.19.2  Limited Supervision is requested for current location  (from modes 
different from Stand By and Post Trip)  
5.19.2.1  In a level 1 area, the beginning of the Limited Supervision area can be the balise 
(group) that gives the Mode Profile. When the train passes the balise group and 
receives this information, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall immediately 
switch to Limited Supervision mode.  
5.19.2.2  In a level 2 or 3 area, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment can receive a mode 
profile giving a Limited Super vision area which the train has already entered with its 
max safe front end. In this case, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall 
immediately switch to Limited Supervision mode.  
5.19.2.3  The driver must acknowledge the Limited Supervision mode. A request of 
acknow ledgement shall be displayed to the driver.  
5.19.2.4  If the driver has not acknowledged after the driver acknowledgement time (refer to 
Appendix A3.1 ), the service brake command  shall be triggered. The brake command is 
released when the driver acknowledges, except if brakes are also applied for another 
reason(s).  
5.19.2.5  Note : Once in Limited Supervision mode, the speed supervision is such that the train 
speed cannot exceed the LS mode speed limit. If, when entering the Limited 
Supervision mode, the train speed was higher t han the LS mode speed limit (because 
a higher speed was allowed in Full Supervision mode, On Sight mode or in Staff 
Responsible mode) then an emergency brake  command  could be immediately 
triggered, independently of the acknowledgement of the driver, but be cause of the LS 
supervision (see Figure 22).

 5.19.3.5  Until the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment has switched to LS mode, according to 
the mode profile, the beginning of the Limited Supervision area s hall be temporarily

5.19.3.7  If the max safe front end of the train reaches the beginning of the  Limited Supervision 
area according the mode profile and the driver has not yet acknowledged, the 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall switch immediately to LS mode and a request 
for acknowledgement shall be displayed to the driver (refer to SRS chapter 4, 
transitions between modes).  
5.19.3.8  If, in this case, the driver does not acknowledge within the driver acknowledgement 
time (refer to Appendix A3.1) after the change to LS mode, the service brake 
command  shall be triggered. The command shall be released as soon a s the driver 
acknowledges (unless the command was triggered also for other reasons).  
5.19.4  Limited Supervision from Unfitted or S N mode  
5.19.4.1  The mode profile with regards to an LS area is only evaluated in levels 1,2,3, although 
the mode profile may have been receive d in level 0 (Unfitted mode) or NTC (SN 
mode). A transition to Limited Supervision mode can therefore earliest occur at a 
transition of level: from level 0 or NTC to level 1 or 2 or 3.

5.19.5  Limited Supervision from Stand By or Post Trip mode  
5.19.5.1  When performing a SoM or a Train Trip procedure and when the current level is 2 or 3, 
the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment can receive a mode profile giving an Limited 
Supervision area whic h the train has already entered with its max safe front end. In this 
case, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall first require an acknowledgement 
from the driver.  
5.19.5.2  When the driver acknowledges, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall perform 
the transitio n to Limited Supervision mode.  
5.19.6  Exit of Limited Supervision mode  
5.19.6.1  General rule  
5.19.6.1.1  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment exits the Limited Supervision mode when the 
min safe front end of the train passes the end of the Limited supervision area.  
5.19.6.2  First case: The Limit ed supervision  area ends at the EOA of the current MA  
5.19.6.2.1  This occurs when the end of the Limited Supervision area that is given by the Mode 
Profile has the same location as the EOA of the related MA.  
5.19.6.2.2  In this case, the train must receive a new Movement Authori ty to be able to exit the 
Limited Supervision area.  
5.19.6.3  Second case: The Limited Supervision  area ends before the EOA of the current 
MA 
5.19.6.3.1  In this case, the current Movement Authority already allows the train to exit the Limited 
Supervision area.  
5.19.6.3.2  When exiting the  Limited Supervision area, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment 
switches either to Full Supervision, On Sight or to Shunting mode (refer to SRS 
chapter 4, transitions between modes).

 6.5 Trackside requirements in relation to older sys tem versions 
6.5.1 Trackside areas operated with system version number X = 1 
6.5.1.1 Introduction 
6.5.1.1.1 The section is applicable for trackside i nfrastructures that will be tendered and still 
operated with the system version number X = 1, afte r the entry into force of this 
release of the SRS. 
6.5.1.1.2 Within a trackside infrastructure operate d with the system version number X = 1, it 
shall be allowed to use the following values of M_V ERSION: 1.0, and 1.1 
6.5.1.1.3 Within a trackside area operated with an RBC certified to the system version number X 
= 1, it shall also be allowed to use the value M_VE RSION = 2.0 for balises. 
6.5.1.1.3.1 Note: this configuration is meaningful in case the trains operating on this RBC area 
support the system version number X = 2 and the on- board requirements related to the 
trackside information marked with 2.0 are applicabl e regardless of the operated 
version (i.e. they are applied by the on-board equi pment even if this latter operates 
with the system version number X = 1 ordered by RBC ). 
6.5.1.2 Exceptions to chapter 3 
6.5.1.2.1 Clause 3.5.3.11 shall be replaced with:”I n case the RBC is the initiator, the first 
message from RBC to on-board shall include a reques t for acknowledgement and shall 
have the time-stamp and the LRBG identity set to "u nknown".”

Speed restriction shall always be sent together wit h the MA to which the information 
belongs” 
6.5.1.2.3 In clause 3.7.1.1 c), the bullet “Optiona lly Speed restriction to ensure a given permitted 
braking distance (see section 3.11. 11)” shall not apply. 
6.5.1.2.4 In clause 3.7.2.4, the bullet “LX speed r estrictions” shall not apply. 
6.5.1.2.5 In clause 3.7.2.4, the bullet “Inhibition  of revocable TSRs from balises in L2/3 (from 
RBC only)” shall not apply. 
6.5.1.2.6 Clause 3.9.3.2 shall be replaced with: “T he orders shall be sent via balise groups.”

 7.3 Components of ERTMS/ETCS Language  
7.3.1  Introduction  
7.3.1.1  The ERTMS/ETCS language is used in transmitting information over the radio, balise 
and loop airgaps.  
7.3.1.2  The ERTMS/ETCS language is based on variables, packets, messages and telegrams 
(variables and packets are des cribed in this section, while telegrams and messages 
are described in chapter 8).  
7.3.1.3  Note: A number of variables contain values which have to be assigned. Some of these 
values have to be unique to ensure that the system functions properly. A centralised 
handl ing of this assignment is therefore required (nationally or internationally, 
depending on the variable). The variables concerned have been marked. The values 
included in this document for these variables are therefore not to be used without prior 
verificat ion of their validity.  See SUBSET -054 for further details.  
7.3.2  Definition of Variables  
7.3.2.1  Variables shall be used to encode single data values. Variables cannot be split in 
minor units. The whole variable has one type (meaning).  
7.3.2.2  Variables may have special values which are related to the basic meaning of the 
variable.  
7.3.2.3  Special values have always the highest values in a variable (eg. 11...111 = “unknown ”). 
7.3.2.4  Spare values shall be located between the normal and special values in the variable 
range  
7.3.2.5  Names of variables are  unique. A variable is used in context with the meaning as 
described in the variable definition. Variables with different meanings have different 
names.  
7.3.2.6  All variable definitions shall be independent of the transport media over which they are 
used, if used in more than one media.  
7.3.2.7  Signed values shall be encoded as 2’s complement.  
7.3.2.8  One bit variables (Boolean) shall always use 0 for false and 1 for true.  
7.3.2.9  Offsets for numerical values shall be avoided (0 shall be used for 0, 1 for 1, etc.) 
except where justified.  
7.3.2.10  When transmitting over the different transmission media, the most significant bit shall 
be transmitted first.  
7.3.2.11  All Variables have one of the following prefixes:

7.3.3  Definition of Packets  
7.3.3.1  Packets are multiple variables grouped into a single unit, with a defined internal 
structure.  
7.3.3.2  This structure consists of a packet header with:  
 Track to Train: a  unique packet number, the length of the packet in bits, the 
orientation information, optionally the distance scale and an information section 
containing a defined set of variables. The packet structure is as follows:  
Number  NID_PACKET  Packet identifier  
Direction  Q_DIR  Specifies the validity  direction 
of transmitted data  
Length  L_PACKET   Number of bits in the packet  
Scale  Q_SCALE  Specifies which distance scale 
is used for all distance 
information within the packet.  
There is no Q_SCALE variable 
in packets  which do not contain 
distance information.  
Information  ...... Well defined set(s) of variables.  
 Train to Track: a unique packet number, the length of the packet in bits, optionally 
the distance scale and an information section containing a defined set o f variables. 
The packet structure is as follows:  
Number  NID_PACKET  Packet identifier  
Length  L_PACKET   Number of bits in the packet  
Scale  Q_SCALE  Specifies which distance scale 
is used for all distance 
information within the packet.

 There is no Q_SCALE va riable 
in packets which do not contain 
distance information.  
Information  ...... Well defined set(s) of variables.  
7.3.3.3  The packet definition does not change when transmitted over different transmission 
media.  
7.3.3.4  All currently not defined packet identifiers are r eserved for future use  and shall be 
considered as invalid values (i.e. like spare values) . Exception: reception of information 
only differing by Y with regards to the highest system version number X supported by 
on-board (refer to section 3.17.3.11) . All f uture packet definitions shall follow the above 
defined structure.  
7.3.3.5  Exception: Packet 0 “Virtual Balise Cover marker” and Packet 255: “End of Telegram” 
do not follow the above defined structure . 
7.3.3.6  N_ITER specifies the number of iterations of a variable or gro up of variables which 
follow.  
7.3.3.7  If N_ITER is 0 then no variables follow.  
7.3.3.8  Two nested levels of iterations can exist.  
7.3.3.9  If, depending on the value of a previous qualifier variable in the packet, a variable is 
optional, it is written indented in the packet defini tion 
7.3.3.10  Note: Row “Transmi tted by” in the description of a packet specifies which 
ERTMS/ETCS trackside device (b alise, loop, RIU, RBC) can  transmi t this packet.  
“Any” means that the packet can be transmitted by a b alise, a loop, an RBC and a RIU . 
7.3.3.10.1  Note: Row “T ransmitted to” in the description of a packet specifies to which 
ERTMS/ETCS trackside device the packet can be transmitted.

 8.3 Introduction  
8.3.1  Scope and Purpose  
8.3.1.1  This chapter defines the format and content of messages necessary for ERTMS/ETCS 
functions.  
8.3.1.2  Concerning the transmission media, this chapter does not cover considerations such 
as medium -specific use constraints (e .g. distance between track -circuit and balise…), 
as well as functions (e .g. detection of balise reference, tim e and location stamp, 
identifying type of receiving balise, Key Management, Releasing/maintaining a radio 
connection…) and performance of the transmission media.  
8.3.2  Definitions  
8.3.2.1  Transmission media considered hereafter are standard ERTMS/ETCS transmission 
media  used for ETCS  (Eurobalise, Euroradio and Euroloop).  
8.3.2.2  A message includes user data (application level) and protocol data (depending on the 
transmission medium).  
8.3.2.3  A Eurobalise message is the information sent by a balise group (i.e. the message is 
composed of one or several telegrams , sorted by balise number in the group (telegram 
from balise number 1 first), ea ch telegram is transmitted by a Eurobalise). A 
Eurobalise telegram contains one header and an identified and coherent set of 
Packets.

 8.4 Rules  
8.4.1  Common Rules  
8.4.1.1  A message (Euroradio/Euroloop) or telegram (Eurobalise) shall be composed of  
1. One Header,  
2. When needed, a predefined set of variables (only for Radio),  
3. When needed, a predefined set of Packets (only for Radio),  
4. Optional Packets as needed by application.  
8.4.1.2  The transmission order shall respect the order of data elements listed in the message 
format (from top to bottom).  
8.4.1.3  The behaviour of the receiver shall not depend on the sequence of the Packets given 
by the message.  
8.4.1.3.1  Exception for Infill information: The locations given in the packets following packet 136 
(Infill Location Reference) shall be referred to the balise group indicated in such 
packet.  
8.4.1.3.2  Note: orientations are in any case always referred to the directionality of  balise group 
(balise transmission), directionality of loop (Euroloop transmission) or directionality of 
LRBG (radio transmission).
