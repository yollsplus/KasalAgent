Introduction  Page 6/9 
 1.3 Introduction  
1.3.1.1  Train control is an important part of any railway operations management system. In the 
past a number of different Automatic Train Control (ATC) systems have evolved in 
different countries at different times. These systems are incompatible and not 
interoperable with each other. Only a few of these systems are used in more than one 
country, an d even in those cases there have been differences in detailed development 
which have resulted in incompatible and not interoperable versions.  
1.3.1.2  Many railways anticipate a significant increase in density of train traffic and are rethinking 
their infrastructur e strategy, to accommodate high levels of traffic, in which ATC systems 
play an important part. Also many railways would like to introduce standardised systems 
to reduce system costs. In order to establish international standardisation of ATC 
systems, the following document specifies the European Rail Traffic Management 
System/European Train Control System (ERTMS/ETCS).  
1.4 Advantages of an International Interoperable System  
1.4.1.1  The advantages expected by the railways can be summarised as:  
• Cross border interoperabi lity. 
• Improvement of the safety of national and international train traffic.  
• Improvement of international passengers and freight train traffic management.  
• Shorter headway on heavily trafficked lines, by driving on moving block, enabling 
exploitation of ma ximum track capacity.  
• The possibility of step -by-step introduction of the new technology.  
• Enabling Pan -European competition between the manufacturers of ERTMS/ETCS 
components. Strengthening the position of the European railway industry on the 
world market.  
• Enabling preconditions for future harmonisation in other areas of rail traffic 
management.  
1.5 About this Document  
1.5.1.1  The purpose of this document is to specify the unified European Train Control System 
(ETCS ) from a technical point of view.  
1.5.1.2  Some parts of the system are only specified to allow a migration from existing train 
control systems to ETCS (e.g. STM’s) over a tra nsition period. They might be removed 
in a future edition of the standard.  
1.5.1.3  To reach technical interoperability it is necessary not only that telegrams are generated 
and understood according to well specified rules but also that a train respectively 
tracksi de equipment reacts in a uniform way to information received. Technical 
interoperability requires spec ifications of a detailed level.

Chapter 1  
Introduction  Page 7/9 
 1.5.1.4  For operational interoperability it is necessary to add operating rules, engineering 
standards etc. to the system design. Reaching operational interoperability i s outside the 
scope of the SRS.  
1.6 How to Read and Use the SRS  
1.6.1.1  The SRS covers 9 chapters, which are briefly described in the section following this 
introduction.  
1.6.1.2  All readers may need to refer to the Glossary  of terms and  abbreviations (SUBSET -023). 
1.7 Requirements  
1.7.1.1  This specification defines the functions that allow reaching the technical interoperability. 
This is materialised through numbered clauses which are formally identified as 
containing ERTMS/ETCS on -board and/or ERTM S/ETCS trackside requirements (see 
details in chapter 9) . 
1.7.1.2  The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall implement all its allocated  requirements, 
with the only exceptions and conditions explicitly stated in the Control -Command and 
Signalling TSI and in this SRS . 
1.7.1.3  For ERTMS/ETCS trackside the implementation of functions has to be defined according 
to the characteristics of the specific lines and the related operational needs. In any case, 
the requirements of this SRS , which are allocated to the trackside and  relate d to the 
implemented functions , shall be respected . 
1.7.1.4  Intentionally deleted . 
1.7.1.5  Not specified requirements and solutions shall only be permitted as long as they do not 
generate any interoperability problems.  
 
1.8 Contents of the SRS  
1.8.1.1  The SRS defines the system requi rements for the European Train Control System 
(ETCS) of ERTMS.  
1.8.1.2  This sub -section is intended to give a rough overview of the contents of each chapter 
within the SRS so that readers interested only in specialised subjects can easily find the 
relevant chapter s. 
1.8.2  Chapter 1:  Introduction  
1.8.2.1  Chapter 1 (this chapter) gives a general introduction to the intention and structure of the 
SRS, including a brief overview of the contents of each chapter.  
1.8.3  Chapter 2:  Basic System Description  
1.8.3.1  Chapter 2 gives an overview of the E RTMS/ETCS system structure.  
1.8.3.2  Chapter 2 also contains a description o f the basic application levels.

Introduction  Page 8/9 
 1.8.3.3  Chapter 2 does not contain technical requirements.  
1.8.4  Chapter 3:  Principles  
1.8.4.1  Chapter 3 specifies the system principles of ETCS/ERTMS. These principles apply to 
onboard and trackside subsystems.  
1.8.4.2  The principles define the behaviour of the system i n general and functional terms.  
1.8.5  Chapter 4:  Modes and Transitions  
1.8.5.1.1  Chapter 4 defines the modes of the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment and all transitions 
between modes.  
1.8.6  Chapter 5:  Procedures  
1.8.6.1  Chapter 5 defines the dynamic behaviour of procedures that are necessary for 
interoperability. Procedures are presented by a state transition chart and a 
corresponding table, where all elements (States, events, transitions) of the cha rt are 
defined. The description of the procedures shows all states of the ERTMS/ETCS 
onboard unit and the conditions that must be fulfilled to switch from one state to another.  
1.8.7  Chapter 6:  Management of older System Versions  
1.8.7.1.1  Chapter 6 defines the envelope o f legally operated system versions and list s the 
exceptions that shall apply by derogation to the requirements listed in the other chapters 
of the SRS, when an older ERTMS/ETCS system version is used  by the trackside 
subsystem . 
1.8.8  Chapter 7:  ERTMS/ETCS Language  
1.8.8.1  Chapter 7 defines and describes the necessary variables to be used for the data flow 
over the air gap between track and train. The grouping of these into packets is described. 
The format of messages is given in Chapter 8.  
1.8.9  Chapter 8:  Messages  
1.8.9.1  Chapter 8 defines the application protocol (format and content of messages, logical 
sequence for radio) necessary to achieve technical interoperability.  
1.8.9.2  The scope of this chapter is limited to the application protoc ol and the content of 
messages.  
1.8.10  Chapter 9:  Classification of the SRS clauses  
1.8.10.1  Chapter 9 encloses a classification into categories of all the clauses in the chapters 1 to 
8 of the SRS.  
1.8.10.2  In particular to assess properly the compliance of an ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment 
with the SRS, it identif ies which clauses contain requirements allocated to the 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment and conversely which ones do not, either because

2.3.1  Scope and purpose  
2.3.1.1  The present chapter gives the basic description of the ERTMS/ETCS system  proposed 
to achieve technical interoperability .

 2.4 System structure  
2.4.1.1  Due to the nature of the req uired functions, the ERTMS/ETCS system  will have to be 
partly on the trackside and partly on board the trains.  
2.4.1.2  This defines two subsystems, the on -board subsystem and the trackside subsystem.  
2.4.1.3  The environment of ERTMS/ETCS system is composed of:  
a) the train  with optionally a Train Integrity Monitoring System , which will then be 
considered in the train interface specification;  
b) the driver, which will then be considered via the driver interface specification;  
c) other onboard interfaces (see architecture drawing in 2.5.3) ; 
d) external trackside systems (interlockings, control centres, etc.), for which no 
interoperability requirement will be established.

 2.5 Subsystems  
2.5.1  Trackside subsystem  
2.5.1.1  Depending o n the application level (see further sections), the trackside subsystem can 
be composed of:  
a) balise  
b) lineside electronic unit  
c) the radio communication network (s) (FRMCS and/or GSM -R) 
d) the Radio Block Centre (RBC)  
e) Euroloop  
f) Radio infill unit  
g) Key Management Centre (KMC)  
h) Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)  
2.5.1.2  Balise  
2.5.1.2.1  The balise is a transmission device that can send telegrams to the on -board subsystem.  
2.5.1.2.2  The balise is based on the existing Eurobalise specifications. These documents are 
included in the frame o f the ERTMS/ETCS specifications.  
2.5.1.2.3  The balises provides the up -link, i. e. the possibility to send messages from trackside to

 2.6 Levels and transitions  
2.6.1  Introduction  
2.6.1.1  The different ERTMS/ETCS application levels (short: levels) are a way to express the 
possible operating rel ationships between track and train. Level definitions are related to 
the trackside equipment used, to the way trackside information reaches the on -board 
units and to which functions are processed in the trackside and in the on -board 
equipment respectively.   
2.6.1.2  Different levels have been defined to allow each individual railway administration to 
select the appropriate ERTMS/ETCS application trackside, according to their strategies, 
to their trackside infrastructure and to the required performance. Furthermore, the 
different application levels permit the interfacing of individual signalling systems and train 
control systems to ERTMS/ETCS.  
2.6.1.3  For the purpose of a consistent specification a level 0 has been defined. This level is 
used for operation on non -equipped (un fitted) lines or on lines  equip ped with train control 
system(s)  but operation under their supervision is currently not possible .  
2.6.2  Definitions  
2.6.2.1  A train equipped with ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment always co -operates with the 
ERTMS/ETCS trackside equipment in a defined ERTMS/ETCS level.  
2.6.2.2  All transitions between levels are performed according to well -specified rules.  
2.6.2.3  ERTMS/ETCS can be configured to operate in one of the following application levels:  
• ERTMS/ETCS Level 0 (train equipped with ERTMS/ETCS operating on a line not 
equipped with any train control system  (ERTMS/ETCS or national system ) or on a 
line equipped with ERTMS/ETCS and/or national system (s) but operation under their 
supervision is currently not possible ) 
• ERTMS/ETCS Level NTC (train equi pped with ERTMS/ETCS operating on a line 
equipped with a national system)  
• ERTMS/ETCS Application Level 1 with or without infill transmission (train equipped 
with ERTMS/ETCS operating on a line equipped with Eurobalises and optionally 
Euroloop or Radio infi ll) 
• ERTMS/ETCS Application Level 2 (train equipped with ERTMS/ETCS operating on a 
line controlled by a Radio Block Centre and equipped with Eurobalises and Euroradio) 
with train detec tion and train separation  performed by the  Radio Block Centre based 
on in formation received from the train and/or by  other  trackside  equipment outside 
the scope of ERTMS/ETCS

 2.6.2.4  It is possible to superimpose several application levels in parallel on the same track, for 
example parallel operation of a line wit h a national system and with ERTMS/ETCS level 
1 or 2. Other examples might be a station which is shared by trains arriving over level 1 
and level 2 lines (junctions).

over the ERTMS/ETCS transmission channels. This information is not used  by 
ERTMS/ETCS.

 2.6.3  ERTMS/ETCS Application Level 0  
2.6.3.1  General description  
2.6.3.1.1  Level 0 covers operation of ETCS equipped trains on lines not equipped with ETCS or 
national systems or on lines where trackside ERTMS/ETCS infrastructure and/or national 
systems may exist but operation under their supervision is currently not possible (e.g. 
commissioning or on -board/trackside failed components) . 
2.6.3.1.2  In Level 0 it is authorized to operate trains without any train control system and therefore 
line side optical signals or other means of signalling are used to give movement 
authorities to the driver.  
2.6.3.1.3  ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment provides no supervision except of the  maximum 
design speed of a train and maximum speed permitted in unfitted areas.  
2.6.3.1.4  Train detection and train separat ion are performed by the trackside equipment of the 
underlying signalling system (interlocking, track circuits etc.) and are outside the scope 
of ERTMS/ETCS.  
2.6.3.1.5  Level 0 uses no track -train transmission except Eurobalises to announce/command level 
transitions. Eurobalises  therefore still have to be read. No balise data except certain 
special commands are interpreted.  
2.6.3.1.6  No supervisory information is indicated on the DMI except the train speed. Train data 
has to be entered in order not to have to stop a train at a level transi tion to ERTMS/ETCS 
equipped area and to supervise maximum train speed.

2.6.4.1  General description  
2.6.4.1.1  Level NTC is used to run ERTMS/ETCS equipped trains on lines equipped with national 
train control and speed supervision systems.  
2.6.4.1.2  Train control information generated trackside by the national train contro l system is 
transmitted to the train via the communication channels of the underlying national 
system.  
2.6.4.1.3  Note: Lineside optical signals might be necessary or not, depending on the performance 
and functionality of the underlying systems.  
2.6.4.1.4  Intentionally deleted . 
2.6.4.1.5  The achievable level of supervision is similar to the one provided by the underlying 
national systems.  
2.6.4.1.6  Train detection and train separat ion are performed by the trackside equipment of the 
underlying signalling system (interlocking, track circuits etc.) a nd are outside the scope 
of ERTMS/ETCS.  
2.6.4.1.7  Level NTC uses no ERTMS/ETCS track -train information  except to announce/command 
level transitions and specific commands related to balise transmission. Eurobalises 
therefore still have to be read.  
2.6.4.1.8  The information dis played to the driver depends on the functionality of the underlying 
national system. The active national system  is indicated to the driver as part of that 
information. Full train data has to be entered in order not to have to stop a train at a level 
transi tion position and to supervise maximum train speed.  
2.6.4.1.9  A combination of national systems can be regarded as one NTC level.  
2.6.4.1.10  Depending on the functionality and the configuration of the specific national system 
installed onboard, the ERTMS/ETCS Onboard system may need to be interfaced to it, in 
order to perform the transitions from/to the national system and/or in order to give access 
to ERTMS/ETCS Onboard resources (e.g. DMI). This can be achieved through a device 
called an STM (Specific Transmission Mo dule) using a standardised interface .

2.6.5  ERTMS/ETCS Application Level 1  
2.6.5.1  General description  
2.6.5.1.1  ERTMS/ETCS Le vel 1 is a spot transmission based train control system to be used as 
an overlay on an underlying signalling system.  
2.6.5.1.2  Movement authorities are generated trackside and are transmitted to the train via  
Eurobalises.  
2.6.5.1.3  ERTMS/ETCS Level 1 provides a continuous speed supervision system, which also 
protects against overrun of the authority.  
2.6.5.1.4  Train detection and train separat ion are performed by the trackside equipment of the 
underlying signalling system (interlocking, track circuits etc.) and are outside  the scope 
of ERTMS/ETCS.  
2.6.5.1.5  Level 1 is based on Eurobalises as spot transmission devices.  
2.6.5.1.6  The trackside equipment does not know the train to which it sends information.  
2.6.5.1.7  If in level 1 a lineside signal clears, an approaching train can not receive this informa tion 
until it passes the Eurobalise group at that signal. The driver therefore has to observe 
the lineside signal to know when to proceed. The train has then to be permitted to 
approach the stopping location below a maximum permitted release speed.  
2.6.5.1.8  Additio nal Eurobalises can be placed between distant and main signals to transmit infill 
information, the train will receive new information before reaching the signal.  
2.6.5.1.9  Note: Lineside signals are required in level 1 applications, except if semi -continuous infill  
is provided.  
2.6.5.1.10  Semi -continuous infill can be provided using Euroloop or radio infill. In this case, the on -
board system will be able to show new information to the driver as soon as it is available 
and even at standstill.  
2.6.5.1.11  Euroloop or radio infill can improv e the safety of a level 1 system as they allow the 
operation without release speed.

 2.6.8  Level transitions  
2.6.8.1  An ERT MS/ETCS equipment which is not isolated always operates in one of the above 
described levels. All transitions between these levels are performed according to defined 
functions and procedures.  
2.6.8.2  Additional national functions and rules which might be used by a n individual railway to 
for example prevent not equipped trains from entering a level 2 area are not specified 
here and have to be implemented outside ERTMS/ETCS.  
2.6.8.3  The following table shows all possible transitions (marked with Grey):  
to 
from                  0 NTC 1 2

 3.3 Introduction  
3.3.1  Scope and purpose  
3.3.1.1  The chapter 3, Principles, specifies the system principles of ETCS/ERTMS. These 
principles apply to on -board and trackside subsystems . 
3.3.1.2  The principles define the operational and technical behaviour of the system in general 
and functional term s. 
3.3.1.3  The chapter is divided into subchapters. In each subchapter normally several

3.4.1  Balise Configurations – Balise Group Definition  
3.4.1.1  A balise group consist s of between one and eight balises  sharing the same balise group 
identity . 
3.4.1.2  In every balise , the following information is  at least stored:  
a) The internal number (from 1 to 8) of the balise  
b) The number of balises inside the group  
c) The balise group identity.  
3.4.1.3  The internal number of the balise describes the relative position of the balise in the group.  
3.4.2  Balise Co -ordinate System  
3.4.2.1.1  Every bali se group has its own co -ordinate system.  
3.4.2.1.2  The orientation of the co -ordinate system of a balise group is defined by the  nominal 
direction (see 3.4.2.2.2 ) and is identified as balise group orientation.  
3.4.2.2  Balise groups composed of two or more balises  
3.4.2.2.1  The origin of the co -ordinate system for each balise group is given by the balise number 
1 (calle d location reference) in the balise group.  
3.4.2.2.1.1  Exception: If the balise number 1 of the group is duplicated, the balise number 2 shall be 
the location reference in case, out of this pair of duplicated balises, the ERTMS/ETCS 
on-board equipment has only receive d the telegram from the balise number 2.

balise group received , being a single balise group, i.e. no linking information is available 
to identify the orientation of the co -ordinate system of this single balise group, the

3.4.2.3.3.1.1  Note: Receiving this type of position report advises the RBC o f the need to assign a 
co-ordinate system to this single balise group.  
3.4.2.3.3.2  When a single balise group is received  and the previous LRBG is known, the position 
report based on two balise groups shall use as direction reference a move from the

 3.4.3  Balise Information Types and Usage  
3.4.3.1  In level 1, a ll information to the on -board system is given from balise groups or 
additionally from Euroloops  or Radio Infill Units  (see section 3.9). In level 2, balise groups 
are mostly used for location information.  
3.4.3.2  In level 1, t he balise information can be of the following type (please refer to section s 
3.6.2.3  and 3.8.5 ): 
a) Non-infill 
b) Intentionally deleted  
c) Infill. 
3.4.3.2.1  Intentionally deleted . 
3.4.3.2.2  Note: Infill information is referring to the location reference of an announced balise group.  
3.4.3.3  Some information shall be read also in sleeping mode and when no linking information 
is available (see Chapter 4 Use of received informatio n). If such information is 
transmitted by balises, and if the information is directional, balise groups consisting of at 
least two balises shall be used.  
3.4.4  Linking  
3.4.4.1  Introduction  
3.4.4.1.1  Aim of linking:  
• To determine whether a balise group has been missed or not recei ved within the 
expectation window (see section 3.4.4.4 ) and take the appropriate action.  
• To assign a co -ordinate system to balise groups consisting  of a single balise.  
• To perform the relocation of location based information without any consideration of 
the odometer inaccuracy (see section 3.6.4 ). 
3.4.4.1.2  A balise group is linked when its linking information (see section 3.4.4.2 ) is k nown in 
advance.  
3.4.4.1.2.1  Note: In cases where a balise group contains repositioning information, the term linked 
also applies since the balise group is announced, marked as linked and contains 
repositioning information marked accordingly.  
3.4.4.2  Content of linking inform ation  
3.4.4.2.1  Linking information shall be composed of:  
a) The identity of the linked balise group.  
b) Where the location reference of the group is. 
c) The accuracy of this location.

Principles  Page 16/252 
 Note: If the reference balise is duplicated, it is the trackside responsibility to define 
the location accuracy to cover at least the location of the two duplicated balises.  
d) The direction with which the linked balise group will be passed over (nominal or 
reverse).  
e) The reaction required if a data consistency problem occurs with the linked  balise  
group.  
3.4.4.2.1.1  "Linking consistency  is checked " shall be interpreted as when : 
a) linking information is stored on -board, AND  
b) depending on the mode the linking consistency check is active, AND  
c) the supervision of the expectation window of the furthest announced balise group has 
not yet been stopped  (see 3.4.4.4.6) . 
3.4.4.2.2  Instead of the identity of a linked balise group it shall be possible to identify a following 
linked balise group as unknown but containing repositioning information . 
3.4.4.2.2.1  Intentionally deleted.  
3.4.4.2.2.2  Note 1: Regarding the repositioning information, see chapter 3.8.5.3.5  and 3.8.5.2.  
3.4.4.2.2.3  Note 2: In case the identity of the next balise group is not una mbiguously known because 
the route is not known by the trackside, this feature allows to link this balise group.  
3.4.4.2.3  For each linked balise group , the trackside shall select one of the following reactions to 
be used in case of data inconsistencies:  
a) Train trip  (Trip mode, see Chapter 4)  
b) Command service brake  
c) No reaction  
For further details see section 3.16.2 . 
3.4.4.3  Unlinked Balise Groups  
3.4.4.3.1  A balise group, whic h contains information that must be considered even when the balise 
group is not announced by linking, is called an unlinked balise group.  
3.4.4.3.2  Unlinked balise groups shall consist at minimum of two balises.   
3.4.4.3.3  Unlinked balise groups shall always contain the un linked balise group qualifier.  
3.4.4.4  Rules applicable to  balise groups when  linking  consistency is checked  
3.4.4.4.1  "Expected balise group" shall be interpreted as an announced balise group whose 
expectation window is currently supervised by the on -board . 
3.4.4.4.2  When the expect ed balise group is referred in the linking information with a balise group 
with ID not set to “unknown” , the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall reject the

 message  from any  balise group marked as linked and not included in the linking 
information.  
3.4.4.4.2.1  When the  expected balise group is referred in the linking information with a balise group 
with ID “unknown”, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall reject the message from 
any balise group marked as linked unless : 
a) the on-board equipment  can determine the orientat ion of the linked balise group by 
information from the balise group itself (therefore excluding for example single balise 
groups), AND  
b) the balise group contains repositioning information valid for the train orientation, AND  
c) the balise group is crossed with  the direction announced in the linking information.  
3.4.4.4.2.2  Balise groups marked as unlinked shall be taken into account.  
3.4.4.4.3  For each  balise group marked as linked and included in the linking information , the 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall check whether  the balise giving the location 
reference  of the group was detect ed (see SUBSET -036 sections 4.2.4.1 and 4.2.4.2) 
within its expect ation window starting  
• when the max safe antenna position  has passed the first possible location of the 
balise group  
and ending  
• when the min safe antenna position has passed the last possible location of the balise 
group  
3.4.4.4.3.1  The first possible location and the  last possible location of the balise group are defined 
by the linking distance and the location accuracy  of the expected balise group . 
3.4.4.4.3.2  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall reject the message from a balise group 
whose location reference is detect ed outside its expectation window  or whose location 
reference is received while its expectation window is no longer supervised . 
3.4.4.4.4  In case of a balise group containing repositioning information, the first possible location 
shall be the reference location of  the previously linked balise group.  
3.4.4.4.5  The on -board equipment shall supervise only one expectation window at a time 
according to the order given by linking information  and starting with the first announced 
balise group in advance of the train . 
3.4.4.4.5.1  Upon reception o f new linking information and after the replacement of previously stored 
linking information (if any), the first announced balise group in advance of the train shall 
be determined by the on -board equipment as the first one in the resulting linking 
informat ion stored on -board, whose end of expectation window has not yet been 
reached.  
3.4.4.4.6  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall stop supervising the expectation window 
of a balise group and shall start supervising  the expectation window of the next one 
announced in  the linking information (if any) when  one of the following events occurs :

 a) the location reference of the  group is detected (see SUBSET -036 sections 4.2.4.1 
and 4.2.4.2)  inside its expectation window  
b) a linking consistency error is found, see 3.16.2.3.1  
c) a balise group message consistency error is found, see 3.16.2.4.1  
3.4.4.4.6.1  Linking consistency error due to early reception of balise group expected later (see 
3.16.2.3.1 c)): if the location reference  received  is the one of the next balise group 
announced in the linki ng information, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall check 
its linking consistency and apply again clause 3.4.4.4.6, i.e. it will immediately expect the 
further next balise group announced in the linking information.  
3.4.4.4.6.2  Note: 3.4.4.4.6 a) implies that in c ase a balise group composed of more than one balise 
is crossed in nominal direction there will be other balise telegram(s) from this group still 
to be received once its expectation window is no longer supervised. Conversely, in case 
a balise group composed  of more than one balise is crossed in reverse direction, the 
telegram(s) of the first balise(s) of this group might be received before its expectation 
window starts to be supervised.  
3.4.4.4.7  In case the expected balise group is referred in the linking information  with a balise group 
with ID not set to “unknown”, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall reject the 
message from this group and trip the train if the balise group is passed in the unexpected 
direction.  
3.4.4.5   Rules applicable to  balise groups when linking cons istency is not checked  
3.4.4.5.1  All balise groups shall be taken into account.  
3.4.5  Euroloop (level 1 only)  
3.4.5.1   End Of Loop Marker (Euroloop announcement)  
3.4.5.1.1  The End Of Loop Marker (EOLM) information is transmitted only by balise groups.  
3.4.5.1.2  The balise group transmitting the EOLM  information marks the beginning of a track area 
where loop messages can be received. In bidirectional applications , it is possible to have 
an EOLM at both sides of a loop.  
3.4.5.1.3  The following information is included in the EOLM:  
• Loop identity used to identify the loop.  
• Key to select the spread spectrum key necessary to receive the loop messages.  
• Distance to the loop giving the distance from the EOLM to the location from where 
the loop is installed.  
• Length of the loop.  
• Indicator telling the on -board whe ther the orientation of the loop (i.e. its nominal 
direction) is identical or opposite to the balise group orientation including the EOLM 
information.

 3.4.5.1.4  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall manage only one EOLM information at a 
time, therefore a new EOLM shall replace a previously stored one.  
3.4.5.1.5  The loop area is defined as the track area from the reference location of the balise group 
from which the EOLM information has been received to the location determined by the 
distance to the loop plus the length of th e loop.  
3.4.5.1.6  After the min safe loop antenna position (calculated by subtracting the distance between 
the active Euroloop antenna and the front end of the train from the min safe front end 
position) has passed the start of the loop area, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board  equipment 
shall delete the EOLM information as soon as the loop antenna position is outside the 
loop area , taking into account the min safe antenna position in case of movement in the 
direction of train orientation and the max safe antenna position in cas e of movement 
opposite to train orientation . 
3.4.5.2  Rules related to Euroloop  
3.4.5.2.1  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall only accept information coming from a 
Euroloop if the loop identity referred in the loop message matches the loop identity 
referred in the EOLM i nformation stored on -board.  
3.4.5.2.2  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall start accepting messages from the 
Euroloop as soon as its corresponding EOLM information is received.  
3.4.5.2.3  The Euroloop information can be of the following type:  
a) Non-infill. 
b) Infill.

3.5.1.1  Note: the following section refers to the behaviour of the user application interacting with 
Euroradio protocols. How the messages are actually transported from the sender to the 
receiver user application is not relevant  for this description.

established.  
3.5.3.5.2.1  Exception: an order to establish a communication session with  an Accepting RBC , which 
is embedded in the RBC transition order,  shall not terminate the communication session 
with the currently supervising  RBC , unless the on -board equipment is only able to handle 
one communication session through GSM -R and the situation is such that a s ession 
must be established with another RBC (see 3.15.1.3.2 .4 for details) .

 3.5.3.7  The establishment of a communication session shall be performed ac cording to the 
following steps:  
a) The on -board shall request the set -up of a safe radio connection with the trackside. If 
this request is part of an ongoing Start of Mission procedure  or is related to the 
establishment of a communication session due to condition 3.5.3.4 c ), it shall be 
repeated until successful or a defined number of times (see Appendix A .3.1). 
If this request is not part of an ongoing Start of Mission procedure  and is not related 
to the establishment of a communication session due to condition 3.5.3.4 c) , it shall 
be repeated until successful . 
A request shal l be repeated immediately after EURORADIO has indicated that setting 
up the safe radio connection has failed.  
b) As soon as the safe radio connection is set -up, the on -board shall send the message 
Initiation of communic ation session to the trackside.  
c) As soon as the trackside receives the information, it  shall send the system version.  
d) When the on -board receives the system version it shall consider the communication 
session established and:  
• If one of its supported system versions is compatible with the one sent by 
trackside, it shall send a session established report, including its  supported system 
versions , to the trackside.  
• If none of its supported system versions is compatible with the one sent by 
trackside, it shall send a version independent message indicating “No compatible 
version supported”. It shall inform the driver and shall terminate the 
communication session.  
e) When the trackside receives the session established report or the information that no 
compatible system version is supported by the on -board, it shall consider the 
communication session established.  Upon reception of a session established report, 
the trackside shall acknowledge the establishment of the communication session to 
the on -board.

3.5.3.7.1  Regarding a), if both radio systems are installed on -board it shall request the set -up of a 
safe radio connection according to the following (by priority order):  
1) In case of order received from tracks ide, depending on whether the order relates 
to an RBC interfaced with FRMCS only, OR  
2) If the stored Radio Network type is FRMCS+GSM -R and if during the SoM the 
driver has elected to perform the mission with only one radio system, by using 
either the FRMCS o n-board equipment or a GSM -R Mobile Terminal, depending 
on the radio system to which the registration was successful during the SoM, OR  
3) According to the stored Radio Network information (Radio Network type and, if 
relevant, GSM -R Radio Network ID). If the Radio Network type is FRMCS+GSM -
R, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board shall use, if available, the preferred radio system 
stored when establishing the previous communication session with the RBC (see 
SUBSET -037-1 for details)  
3.5.3.7.2  Regarding b), if both radio systems are i nstalled on -board it shall store the radio system 
through which the safe radio connection is successfully set up.  
3.5.3.7.3  Exception to d): when the on -board does not receive the system version within a fixed 
waiting time (see A.3.1) it shall request the release of  the safe radio connection with the 
trackside and shall restart the establishment of the communication session with step a).

 3.5.3.7.4  Regarding e), in case the on -board has sent a session established report: when the on -
board does not receive an acknowledgement of the establishment of the communication 
session within a fixed waiting time (see A.3.1), it shall again send a session established 
report to the trackside.  
3.5.3.7.4.1  If, following the repetition of the session established report, the acknowledgement of 
session establ ishment is still not received within the fixed waiting time, the on -board shall 
terminate the communication session and re -establish a new one.  
3.5.3.7.5  Exception to e): If the trackside receives  a "Termination of communication session" 
message , instead of a sessio n established report or the information that no compatible 
system version is supported by the on -board, it shall abort the process of session 
establishment and proceed with clause 3.5.5.2 b).  
3.5.3.8  When a communication session is currently being established (i.e . at any time from the 
first request the set -up of a safe radio connection to the reception of the system version 
from trackside), the on -board shall no longer apply 3.5.3.7 a), 3.5.3.7 b) and 3.5.3.7 d) 
(i.e. it aborts the process of establishing it) and shall release the safe radio connection 
(if any) if at least one of the following conditions is met : 
a) The driver closes the desk during Start of Mission  
b) End of Mission is performed  
c) An order to terminate the communication session is received from trackside  
d) The train passes with its min safe rear  end a level transition border from a level 2 area 
to an area where level 2 operation is not supported  
e) An order to establish a communication session with a different RBC is received from 
trackside and the order does not request to contact an Accepting RBC

 3.5.3.11.2  Justification: In case of EIRENE short number selection by the dr iver, the termination of 
the connection if the “most appropriate RBC” does not match the one previously stored 
on-board (EURORADIO functionality) must not occur.  
3.5.3.11.3  Note 2: the ‘EIRENE short number’ is a GSM -R only function. It is not used if the Radio 
Networ k type is FRMCS or is FRMCS+GSM -R while FRMCS is the only radio system 
installed on -board .

using the stored RBC contact information , if any); the phone number indicated in the 
order shall be ignored by the on -board equip ment.  
3.5.3.13.1  If there is no RBC contact information  stored on -board, the order to establish a 
communication session with  the last known RBC shall be ignored.  
3.5.3.14  Note: If a short number is used (considering trackside call routing), that number can be 
programmed into the balise instead of the normal phone number.  
3.5.3.15  An order to establish a communication session with  the RBC may contain a special value 
for the RBC phone number indicating that the on -board shall use the on -board short 
number.  
3.5.3.15.1  Intentionally deleted . 
3.5.4  Maintain ing a communication session  
3.5.4.1  When a communication session is established , in case of a loss of the safe radio 
connection, i.e., if the disconnection has not been ordered (see 3.5.5.1), the involved 
entities shall consider the communication session still est ablished for a defined time. The 
defined time shall start as soon as EURORADIO has indicated the loss of the safe radio 
connection.  
3.5.4.2  When EURORADIO indicates the loss of the safe radio connection, the ERTMS/ETCS 
on-board equipment shall immediately try to s et-up a new safe radio connection  using 
the radio system through which the safe radio connection was successfully set up 
beforehand (see SUBSET -037-1 for details) . 
3.5.4.2.1  If the safe radio connection is not re -established after the defined time (as defined in 
A.3.1), both, on -board equipment and trackside, shall consider the session as 
terminated.  
3.5.4.3  The attempts shall be repeated, until at least one of the following conditions is met:  
• The safe radio connection is set -up. 
• The session is considered as terminated.

 • The train passes the location indicated in the RIU order “Terminate the 
communication session”  
3.5.4.3.1  Note: if the session is considered as terminated due to 3.5.4.2.1, the attempts will be 
resumed immediately according to 3.5.3.4 f).  
3.5.4.4  Exception to 3.5 .4.2 and 3.5.4.3: the on -board equipment shall not try to set up a new 
safe radio connection and shall stop any ongoing attempts if the engine, taking into 
account its front and rear ends,  overlaps  an announced radio hole (see 3.12.1.3 ). The 
on-board equip ment shall try to set it up again when the  engine rear/front end reaches  
the end of the radio hole , depending on whether the train orientation is the same 
as/opposite to the active cab . 
3.5.4.5  In case a message has to be sent during the loss of the safe radio connection, this 
message shall be considered as sent.  
3.5.4.6  When the trackside receives a session established report inside an existing 
communication session it shall acknowledge the establishment of the communication 
session to the on -board.  
3.5.4.7  When the on -board receives a system version message inside an existing 
communication session it shall send a session established report.  
3.5.4.7.1  Note: An RBC could repeat the system version message if it assumes that the message 
was not received by the on -board.  
3.5.5  Terminating a communication session  
3.5.5.1  The termination of a communication session shall be initiated only by the on -board and 
in the following cases:  
a) If an order is received from trackside (RBC , RIU  or balise groups) (see section 3.5.2 
concerning the content of the order).  
b) If a condition requiring the termination of the communication session is fulfilled without 
any explicit trackside order. The situations in which such condition is met are detailed

 3.5.6  Managing  the Radio Network s 
3.5.6.1  ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall order the registration of its connected GSM -R 
Mobile Terminal(s) to a GSM -R Radio Network:  
a) At power -up 
b) Following driver entry of a new GSM -R Radio Network identity  
c) If ordered from the trackside  
3.5.6.1.1  In order to manage the transitions between different Radio Networks, the trackside can 
transmit Radio Network transition orders, which include:  
a) The Radio Network type (FRMCS, FRMCS+GSM -R, or GSM -R) 
b) Only if the Radio Network type is FRMCS+GSM -R or GSM -R, the GSM -R Radio 
Network identity  
3.5.6.1.2  Note 1: Unlike the GSM -R Radio Networks, the FRMCS Radio Network can be seen by 
ETCS as one single entity without the need for ETCS to order the registration of its 
connected FRMCS on -board equipment to the FRMCS Radio Network or to manage the 
transitions between networks, which permits e.g. to not interrupt a r adio connection on 
passing an international border where FRMCS is installed on both sides of the border.  
3.5.6.1.3  Note 2:  As soon as it is powered -up, the FRMCS on -board equipment reports 
continuously to the ETCS on -board equipment whether it is registered or not t o the 
FRMCS radio network, i.e. that it is ready or not to establish a radio connection with an 
RBC . 
3.5.6.2  When powered -off, ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall memorize the last received 
Radio Network type and GSM -R Radio Network identity if any (from trackside or from 
driver) and shall use it (them) when powered -up again.  
3.5.6.3  If no GSM -R Radio Network identity re ceived from trackside or from driver could have 
been memorized by ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment (e.g. after a System Failure or 
at very first power -up), this latter shall nevertheless order the registration of its Mobile 
Terminal(s) to a default GSM -R Radio Network.  
3.5.6.3.1  Note 1: the source used to retrieve the default GSM -R Radio Network identity (on -board 
equipment permanent storage, Mobile Terminal itself, or other external source) is 
implementation dependent.  
3.5.6.3.2  Note 2: if ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment is powered -up in an area not covered by 
the memorized or default GSM -R Radio Network, attempts to register to this Radio 
Network will be repeated unconditionally by the Mobile Terminal(s) until either an attempt 
is successful or a new GSM -R Radio Network identity is received from trackside or from 
driver, preventing Mobile Term inal(s) from registering to any unwanted GSM -R Radio 
Network.

 3.5.6.4  If no Radio Network type received from trackside or from driver could have been 
memorized by ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment (e.g. after a System Failure or at very 
first power -up), this latter sh all use a default value configured on -board . 
3.5.6.5  On reception of the Radio Network transition  order, ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment 
shall store the Radio Network type and, if the Radio Network type included in the order 
is FRMCS+GSM -R or GSM -R, it shall  immedia tely order the Radio Network registration 
of each GSM -R Mobile Terminal that fulfils the following conditions:  
a) it is not yet registered to the ordered GSM -R Radio Network, AND  
b) it is not used for an established communication session, AND  
c) no safe radio conne ction is being set -up 
3.5.6.6  If a GSM -R Mobile Terminal is not currently registered to the GSM -R Radio Network 
ordered by trackside and if one of the conditions b) or c) is not fulfilled, ERTMS/ETCS 
on-board equipment shall initiate the GSM -R Radio Network regist ration once 
communication session is terminated and safe radio connection is released.  
3.5.6.7  Any order to establish a communication session with  an RBC received from trackside 
shall not lead to any request to set -up a safe radio connection  by ERTMS/ETCS on -
board  equipment  if: 
a) the stored Radio Network type is FRMCS or is FRMCS+GSM -R while FRMCS is the 
only radio system installed on -board and the FRMCS on -board is not registered to the 
FRMCS Radio Network, OR  
b) the stored Radio Network type is FRMCS+GSM -R while both radio systems are 
installed on -board, and, unless the driver has elected to perform the mission with only 
one radio system, either the FRMCS on -board is not registered to the FRMCS Radio 
Network or no GSM -R Mobile Terminal is duly registered to a GSM -R Rad io Network, 
OR 
c) the stored Radio Network type is FRMCS+GSM -R while both radio systems are 
installed on -board, and, while the driver has elected to perform the mission with only 
one radio system, the concerned on -board radio system is no longer registered to  the 
Radio Network, OR  
d) the stored Radio Network type is GSM -R or is FRMCS+GSM -R while GSM -R is the 
only radio system installed on -board and no GSM -R Mobile Terminal is duly registered 
to a GSM -R Radio Network.  
3.5.6.8  Any order to establish a communication session  with an RIU received from trackside 
shall not lead to any request to set -up a safe radio connection by ERTMS/ETCS on -
board equipment if no GSM -R Mobile Terminal is duly registered to a GSM -R Radio 
Network .

 3.5.7  Safe Radio Connection Indication  
3.5.7.1  The ERTMS/ETCS o n-board equipment shall inform the driver about the status of the 
safe radio connection. To that purpose, the following indication statuses of the safe radio 
connection are defined: “No Connection”, “Connection Lost/Set -Up failed”, “Connection 
Up”. 
3.5.7.2  In addi tion, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall use a “connection status” timer 
(see Appendix A.3.1), in order to manage properly the transitions to the indication status 
“Connection Lost/Set -Up failed”.  
3.5.7.2.1  Note: The purpose of the “connection status” timer is to avoid distracting the driver for 
any short disturbance of the safe radio connection.  
3.5.7.3  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall start the “connection status” timer as soon 
as the first request to set -up a safe radio connection with the relevant RBC/RIU is sent:  
a) regard ing the session establishment, see items b), c), d), e) in 3.5.3.4.  
b) regard ing maintaining a communication session, see 3.5.4.2 and 3.5.4.4  
3.5.7.4  If the “connection status” timer is ongoing, it shall be stopped if the requests to set -up a 
safe radio c onnection are stopped with the relevant RBC/RIU . 
3.5.7.5  The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall execute the transitions between the 
different indication statuses of the safe radio connection with the relevant RBC/RIU as 
described in Table 1 according to the conditions in Table 2 (see section 4.6.1 for details 
about the symbol s).

3.5.7.6  For the case of an RBC/RBC transition, the safe radio connection indicated to the driver 
shall switch f rom the indication status of the safe radio connection with the Handing over 
RBC to the one with the Accepting RBC as soon as one of the following conditions is 
met: 
a) the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment sends a position report directly to the 
Accepting RBC wi th its maximum safe front end having passed the border, see 
3.15.1.3.5 (i.e. the Accepting RBC becomes the supervising RBC),  
b) the safe radio connection is released with the Handing over RBC and the minimum 
safe rear end of the train has passed the border.  
3.5.7.6.1  Note: During an RBC/RBC handover procedure, an indication status transition table and 
a connection status timer might have to be managed at the same time, for each RBC.  
3.5.7.7  For the case of safe radio connection with RIU’s, the safe radio connection indicated to  
the driver shall be the one related to the current infill area.  
3.6 Location Principles,  Train Position and Train Orientation  
3.6.1  General  
3.6.1.1  Two types of location based information  are defined : 
a) Information  that refers only to a given location, referred to as Location data (e.g. level 
transition orders, linking)  
b) Information  that remains valid for a certain distance, referred to as Profile data (e.g. 
SSP, gradient).

3.6.1.3  The Train Position information defines the position of the train front in relation to a 
reference balise group, which is called LRBG (the Last Relevant Balise Group) in case 
the balise group is marked as  linked and may be used for reporting the train position to 
the RBC (i.e. the balise group is LRBG compliant, see 3.6.2.2.2 a)), and/or in relation to 
other  reference balise group s, which are called ORBGs (Other Reference Balise 
Group s). 
It includes for ea ch of the reference balise groups (LRBG/ ORBGs): 
• The estimated train front end position, defined by the estimated distance between the 
LRBG/ ORBG and the front end of the train  
• The train position confidence interval (see 3.6.4 .1) 
• Directional train position i nformation in reference to the balise group orientation (see 
3.4.2, also Figure 14) of the LRBG/ ORBG, regarding:  
− the position of the train front end (nominal or reverse side of the 
LRBG/ ORBG) 
− the train orientation  
− the train running direction  
The ORBGs are  at least the seven previous LRBGs  last reported to the RBC , which 
may alternatively be used by trackside for referencing location dependent information 
(see 3.6.2.2.2 c)) , the balise groups used as reference by information stored in any 
of the transition buffers (see section 4.8), and either the last passed balise group 
marked as unlinked or the last two passed balise groups marked as unlinked if there 
is no balise group marked as linked in between . 
3.6.1.3.1  Note: the train position information in relation to an ORBG is necessary to relocate all 
location based information to the Single On -board Location Reference (SOLR), in case 
no linking distance can be used (see section 3.6.4.2).

 3.6.1.3.2  The status of the Train Position information (see 3.6.1.3) is defined as unknown i n case 
neither a train position in relation to an LRBG nor in relation to an ORBG is stored on -
board.  
3.6.1.3.3  Note: After the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment has been powered -off, a stored train 
position remains in status “invalid” until it is either revalidated (st atus becomes “valid”) or 
deleted (status becomes “unknown”).  
3.6.1.3.4  The front end of the train refers to the front end of the engine with regards to the train 
orientation. Exception: In Stand -By mode while no valid Train Data is available but the 
safe consist len gth information is available, i n Supervised Manoeuvre requests , and from 
the time the first Supervised Manoeuvre authorisation is received to the time the mission 
is either ended or continued in Non Leading mode, the estimated front end  of the train 
takes into account the nominal consist length in front of/in rear of the engine depending 
on whether the train orientation is the same as/opposite to the active cab . 
3.6.1.4  When the train position is unknown or invalid, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment 
shall consider that a valid train position is stored on -board as soon as an LRBG or an 
ORBG has been passed and any previously stored invalid train position shall be deleted . 
3.6.1.4.1  Intentionally deleted . 
3.6.1.5  If there is an active cab, this one defines the orientation of the train, i.e . the side of the 
active cab shall be considered as determining the front of the train. If no cab is active, 
the train orientation shall be defined by the  last active  cab. 
3.6.1.5.1  Exception: from the time the first Supervised Manoeuvre authorisation is r eceived to the 
time the mission is either ended or continued in Non Leading mode, the train orientation 
shall be determined by the direction of the Movement Authority in the last received 
Supervised Manoeuvre authorisation, regardless of the position of th e engine in the 
shunting consist and of which of its cab(s) is active . 
3.6.1.5.2  Note: The train orientation cannot be affected by the direction controller position.  
3.6.1.6  The estimated front end shall be used when supervising location based information, 
unless stated oth erwise.  
3.6.1.7  The min safe rear end position shall be calculated by subtracting from the min safe front 
end position, the train length stored as valid Train Data or if no valid Train Data is 
available  but the safe consist length information is available:  
• the min  safe consist length in front of the engine and the max safe consist length in 
rear of the engine, if the train orientation is the same as the active cab, or  
• the min safe consist length in rear of the engine and the max safe consist length in 
front of the engine, if the train orientation is opposite to the active cab.

 3.6.2  Location reference of Data Transmitted to the On -Board Equipment  
3.6.2.1  Data Transmitted by Balises  
3.6.2.1.1  All location and profile data transmitted by a balise shall refer to the location reference 
and ori entation of the balise group to which the balise belongs.  
3.6.2.1.2  Exception: Regarding infill information the section 3.6.2.3.1  shall apply . 
3.6.2.2  Data Transmitted by Radio from RBC  
3.6.2.2.1  All location and profile data transmitted from the RBC shall refer to the location reference 
and orientation of the LRBG given in the same mess age. 
3.6.2.2.2  For the LRBG the following requirements have to be met:  
a) The on -board equipment shall use as a reference for reporting the train position to the 
RBC  the last passed LRBG compliant balise group that fulfils the conditions of the 
clause 3.6.5.1.8.  
This b alise group is termed as LRBG ONB in the following . 
Only  
• balise groups marked as linked and contained in the previously received linking 
information, if linking consistency  is checked  on-board  
 or  
• balise group s not marked as unlinked, if linking consistency was not checked  when 
such a  balise group was passed  
shall be regarded  as LRBG compliant balise groups . 
b) The RBC shall use a balise group which was reported by the on -board equipment as 
a reference (in the foll owing termed as LRBG RBC). At a certain moment LRBG RBC and 
LRBG ONB can be different.  
c) The on -board equipment shall be able to accept information referring to one of at least 
eight LRBG ONB last reported to the RBC.  
3.6.2.2.2.1  Exception  to a) : When the train  position is unknown , or when position data has been 
deleted during SoM procedure , or when the train position is valid or invalid but only 
referred to a balise group marked as unlinked , the on -board equipment shall use an 
LRBG identifier set to "unknown" until the onboard has pass ed an LRBG compliant  balise 
group  that fulfils the conditions of the clause 3.6.5.1.8 . 
3.6.2.2.2.2  Exception to b): When the RBC has received from the onboard an unknown position  (as 
per 3.6.2.2.2.1)  or during SoM procedure an invalid position which it  is not able to 
confirm, the RBC shall use an LRBG identifier set to "unknown" until it receives a position 
report from the onboard having pass ed an LRBG compliant  balise group  that fulfils the 
conditions of the clause 3.6.5.1.8 .

 3.6.2.2.2.3  Regarding c):  From the time it has reported an unknown position, or an invalid position 
during SoM procedure, to the time it has received from the RBC a message with an 
LRBG n ot set to “unknown”, the on -board equipment shall also be able to accept 
messages from the RBC containing LRBG “unknown”.

c) the loop orientation (which refers itself to the orientation of the balise group 
transmitt ing the EOLM information, see 3.4.5.1.3 ) for information sent by this loop  
3.6.3.1.2  Data transmitted to the on -board equipment shall be identified as being valid for  
a) both directions  
b) the nominal direction  
c) the reverse direction  
of the referenced balise gr oup (for information sent by balise or radio) or of the loop (for

3.6.3.1.2.1  Deleted.  
3.6.3.1.3  When receiving information from any transmission medium, the ERTMS/ETCS  on-board 
equipment shall only take into account information valid for the train  orientation. Other 
information shall be ignored.  
3.6.3.1.3.1  Exception 1: for SL, PS and SH engines, balise group crossing direction shall be 
considered.  
3.6.3.1.3.2  Exception 2: information in a Supervised Manoeuvre authorisation shall be taken into 
account also when its validity direction is opposite to that of the current train orientation  
3.6.3.1.4  If the train orientation cannot be referred to a direction of the trackside device to which 
the transmitted information refers  (or for SL, PS and SH engines if the balise group 
crossing direction is unknown ), data received from any transmission medium valid for 
one direction only (nominal or reverse) shall be rejected by the onboard equipment. Data 
valid for both directions shall be evaluated (see section 4.8).  
3.6.3.1.4.1  Exception: if not rejected due to balise group message consistency check (see 
3.16.2.4.4.1 and 3.16.2.5.1.1), data to be forwarded to a National System (see section 
3.15.6) valid for one direction only shall be accepted. Jus tification: the co -ordinate 
system of the balise group might be known to the National System by other means 
inherent to the National System itself . 
3.6.3.1.4.2  Note: the clause 3.6.3.1. 4 applies for example if no co -ordinate system has been

3.6.3.2.4  According to Figure 12 the structure for non -continuous profile data shall allow  to contain 
multiple elements (value (n) for length(n )) inside the profile.  
a) Distance to the start of each element (value(n) for length(n)) shall be given as 
unsigned incremental values , each increment representing the distance between

3.6.4  Train Position Confidence Interval  and Relocation  
3.6.4.1  Train Position Confidence Interval  
3.6.4.1.1  The confidence interval to the train  position refer s to the distance to the reference balise 
group  and take s into account  
a) On-board over-reading amount and under -reading amount , which include among 
other things the odometer accuracy and the error in detection of  the balise group 
location reference . 
b) The location accuracy of the reference balise group . 
3.6.4.1.2  Note: The confidence interval increases in relation to the distance travelled from the 
reference balise group depending on the accuracy of odometer equipment.  
3.6.4.1.3  The value of the Locatio n Accuracy shall be determined by Linking information when it 
becomes  available, or, if it has not been previously determined by Linking information 
when the balise group becomes LRBG or ORBG , by the corresponding National Value 
or the corresponding Defaul t Value if the National Value is not applicable.  
3.6.4.1.4  Once the location accuracy of a balise group has been determined according to the 
clause 3.6.4. 1.3, it shall not be updated (e.g. neither upon reception of further Linking 
information, nor when linking is no  longer checked, nor when new National Values 
becomes applicable).  
3.6.4.1.5  The confidence interval to the train front end position shall be delimited by:  
a) The min(imum) safe front end position, which is in rear (in relation to the orientation 
of the train) of the e stimated train front end position at a distance calculated as follows:  
𝐿𝑑𝑜𝑢𝑏𝑡𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟  = 𝑄𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑎𝑐𝑐−𝑟𝑒𝑓𝐵𝐺+overreading amount + 𝛾⋅𝐿𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟  
b) The max(imum) safe front end position, which is in advance (in relation to the 
orientation of the train) of the estimated train front end position at a distance calculated 
as follows:  
 𝐿𝑑𝑜𝑢𝑏𝑡𝑢𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑟 =𝑄𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑎𝑐𝑐−𝑟𝑒𝑓𝐵𝐺+underreading amount + 𝛾⋅𝐿𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑢𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑟  
With 𝛾=1 only in Stand -By mode while no valid Train Data is available but the safe 
consist length information is available, in Supervised Manoeuvre requests, and from the 
time the first Supervised Manoeuvre authorisation is received to the time the mission is 
either ended or continued in Non Leading mode, and with 𝐿𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟  & 𝐿𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑢𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑟

 • 𝐿𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑢𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑟  is the difference between the Train Data max safe consist length and 
nominal consist length in front of/in rear of the engine, depending on whether 
the train orient ation is the same as/opposite to the active cab respectively.  
• 𝐿𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟  is the difference between the Train Data nominal consist length and

3.6.4.2  Relocation  
3.6.4.2.1  The relocation consists in changing the reference location of all location based 
inform ation handled by the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment, so that as soon it is used 
and at any further time it is referred to the Single On -board Location Reference (SOLR).  
3.6.4.2.2  The Single On -board Location Reference (SOLR) shall be:  
a) the last received balise group t hat is the reference of linking information or that is 
announced in linking information (including if it is announced with a balise group with 
ID “unknown” and it contains repositioning information), while the linking consistency 
is checked (see 3.4.4.2.1. 1), or  
b) the last received balise group, while no linking consistency is checked.  
3.6.4.2.2.1  Exception to 3.6.4.2.2 b): when exiting N o Power  mode, the SOLR shall be set to the 
stored LRBG if any.  
3.6.4.2.2.2  Whenever linking information is received (e.g. when it is released from the transition 
buffer) , the clause 3.7.3.1 m) shall be applied before this clause 3.6.4.2.2. For all other 
information, any relocation to the SOLR resulting from this clause 3.6.4.2.2 shall take 
place before the corresponding item of the clause 3.7.3.1 is applied.

 3.6.4.2.2.3  Note: the SOLR is generally equal to the LRBG ONB. For some cases however, like the 
transition to level 1/ 2 area, it might be possible that the linking information released from 
the transition buffer provokes the change of SOLR to a former LRBG in case this 
information does not announce every balise group in rear of the border (see Figure 13e).  
3.6.4.2.3  Before it can be relocated, all location based information received from trackside shall 
be first processed by the on -board equipment into a series of indivi dual location items 
each of them being referred to an individual distance to the reference balise group of the 
location based information, this distance being counted positive/negative depending on 
whether the location item is in advance of/in rear of the reference balise group with 
regards to the train orientation.  
3.6.4.2.4  For a given location based information (e.g. EOA), up to three individual location items 
can be defined, as stipulated in Table 2a. Whenever a (or a part of a) clause of the ETCS 
specifications is mentioned in this Table 2a, it shall be applied by the ERTMS/ETCS on -
board equipment using the corresponding types of location item.

Signalling related speed 
restriction from an infill device  start  Not relevant  
Justification : The signalling speed restriction received by infill MA can only be 
accepted if the infill reference is known by linking with known ID . Moreover, 
SOLR at that time is also part of linking, because the existence of BG(s) 
announced by linking provokes a change of SOLR by 3.6.4.2.2a . As a 
consequence, the start location of this infill signalling speed restricti on is always 
relocated through  linking distance as per 3.6.4.2.5a, so that its classification as 
"min", "max" or "estimated" location item has no influence .

Table 2a: Correspondence between location items and  
clauses in the ETCS specifications using them  
3.6.4.2.4.1  Note 1: an individual location based information can be classified as several types of 
location items. For example, the EOA location is an "estimated" location item to define 
SBD foot, a "min" location item to provoke entry into Trip mode and a "max" location item 
if it defines the SvL. As a second example, a single TSR encompasses two locat ion 
items, i.e. a "max" location item at its start location and a "min" location item at its end 
location. Classification of TSR location item, as true for any Speed Restriction, is 
indirectly deduced from the fact that V_MRSP is obtained with the min safe  front end and 
the max safe front end of the train as per clause 3.13.10.2.8.  
3.6.4.2.4.2  Note 2: in general (but not necessarily for all the functions), an “estimated”/”min”/”max” 
location item is used to apply a clause when this latter involves a comparison against the 
estimated front end position/min safe rear end position or the min safe antenna position/ 
max safe front end position or the max safe antenna position.  
3.6.4.2.4.3  Note 3: as long as linking distance(s) can be used to perform the relocation, several 
items associat ed to a given location based information will be referred with the same 
distance to the SOLR by the on -board. Otherwise, these location items (e.g. “min”, 
“estimated” and “max” MA section ends) will be referred to the SOLR with different 
distances, after a  relocation as per clause 3.6.4.2.5 b) or c) has taken place.

 3.6.4.2.5  When a balise group becomes the SOLR or when evaluating (see section 4.8) location 
based  trackside information, which is referred to a balise group different from the SOLR, 
every  location item shall be relocated to the SOLR by subtracting from the distance to its 
former  reference balise group (FRBG) : 
a) the distance between the FRBG  and the SOLR, retrieved from linking information if it 
is available and known (i.e. no linking distance to a repositioning balise group being 
encountered between these balise groups) and, if any, the last relocation of this 
location item has not been performed as per clause 3.6.4.2.5 c) , OR 
b) if the last relocation of this location item has been performed as per clause 3.6.4.2.5 
c) towards a BG not received earlier than the reference BG of this location item, the 
distance between the FRBG and the SOLR retrieved from link ing information if it is 
available and known (i.e. no linking distance to a repositioning balise group being 
encountered between these balise groups):  
• as such, for "estimated" location items,  
• diminished by twice the location accurac y of the FRBG, for "min"  location items,  
• augmented by twice the location accurac y of the FRBG, for "max" location 
items, OR  
c) in all other cases, the estimated , min or max  travelled distance between the FRBG  
and the SOLR, computed as per clauses 3.6.1.3 and 3.6.4.1. 5 from train fro nt end 
positions in reference to FRBG and to SOLR, as follows:  
• (estimated front end position against FRBG – estimated front end position 
against SOLR) for "estimated" location items,  
• (min safe front end position against FRBG – min safe front end position a gainst 
SOLR) for "min" location items,  
• (max safe front end position against FRBG – max safe front end position against 
SOLR) for "max" location items.  
3.6.4.2.5.1  Note 1: For infill information or when evaluating information from a balise group marked 
as unlinked whil e linking consistency is checked, the distances used for relocation will 
always be negative and will result in an increase of the supervised distances to the 
location items (because they are relocated back to the SOLR).  
3.6.4.2.5.2  Note 2: The FRBG can be the former S OLR, a balise group that does not become the 
SOLR (e.g. an unlinked balise group while linking consistency is checked), a balise group 
that has transmitted information that has been stored in the transition buffer , the LRBG 
used in an RBC message or an inf ill location reference.  
3.6.4.2.5.3  Note 3: All reference balise groups that are used in clause 3.6.4.2.5 are listed in Train 
Position defined in 3.6.1.3. Furthermore, the list of the location items that was relocated 
as per clause 3.6.4.2.5 c) needs also to be memori sed to apply this clause 3.6.4.2.5.  
3.6.4.2.5.4  Note 4: By principle, the relocation from former SOLR to new SOLR done by clause 
3.6.4.2.5 c) has no effect on the supervision of the location items, because the same

 change of distances within the Train Position is appl ied inversely to the distances of the 
location items.  
3.6.4.2.5.5  Note 5: The supervision of distances on -board will always be safe using these rules, 
together with the SUBSET -040 §4.6.1.1 rule as prerequisite. If the trackside wants to 
increase the performance, it is  its responsibility to provide linking in due course or to 
repeat the location based information in reference to further balise groups.  
3.6.4.2.6  Regarding the continuous profiles (i.e. SSP and gradient): if a relocation as per clause 
3.6.4.2.5 b) or c) results in a t least one change of value being relocated in rear of one or 
more  preceding change (s) of  value, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall 
recompose the continuous profile according to the following steps:  
• Step 1: For each concerned set of consecutive  change s of value, the on -board shall 
consider the profile as if it would have been received from trackside with, by exception 
to 3.6. 3.2.2 c), an incremental distance being negative  from the furthest in advance 
concerned change of value to the furthest in rear c oncerned change of value ; 
• Step 2: From the end location to the start location of each “reverted” element(s) 
delimited by a negative incremental distance, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment 
shall retain the lowest parts of the overlapping elements obtained f rom step 1;  
• Step 3: The clause 3.6.4.2.3 shall be applied to the profile obtained from step 2, 
resulting in a continuous profile with all discontinuities ordered by increasing individual 
distances referred to the SOLR, as if this profile would have been re ceived by 
trackside being compliant with 3.6. 3.2.2 (i.e. with only unsigned incremental 
distances) . 
3.6.4.2.6.1  Note: the recomposed profile obtained from the clause 3.6.4.2.6 may include less 
elements than the profile before relocation, possibly with the original cha nge(s) to higher 
value no longer present depending on the respective speed/gradient values of the 
concerned overlapping elements considered in steps 1 and 2.

• 1st relocation : When the ERTMS/ ETCS on -board reads  UBG 1, it does n ot become  the SOLR , 
so that the location items of the TSR within the messag e it provides  are relocated by clause 
3.6.4.2. 5c on BG1  (which was re ceived e arlier ) which i s the SOLR  at that time : 
➢ the absolute  value of the differ ence between th e max safe  front end  posit ions agains t 
BG1 and against UBG1 is added (substract ion of a  negative differe nce) to D_TSR  
("max" location  item). 
➢ the absolute  value of the differ ence between the min safe front end  positions  agains t 
BG1 and against UBG1 is added  (substrac tion of a  negative differe nce) to (D_TSR  + 
L_TSR)  ("min" location  item). 
The start & end locatio ns of the T SR are h andled independently  ; the or iginal L_TSR is not  
used as a separate v ariable by the relocation  process . 
• 2nd relocation : When the ER TMS/ ETCS on -board reads  BG2, it becomes the  new SOLR , so 
that the TSR location items  are relocated on it: despite linking distance is  availab le betwe en 
BG1 and BG 2, the relocation  of the TSR location ite ms is neither  perfor med by clause 
3.6.4.2. 5a nor by clause 3.6.4.2.5b , as the last reloc ation of the TSR location  items  has been 
perform ed by clause  3.6.4.2. 5c to a balise  group , which was re ceived e arlier than the former 
reference  balise group  of the TSR  location item s, so: 
➢ the absolute  value of t he difference between the  max safe fr ont end  posit ions against 
BG1 and against BG2 is subtracted from D_TSR ("max" location  item). 
➢ the absolute  value of the difference between the  min safe front end  positions  against 
BG1 and against BG2 is subtracted  from (D_TSR  + L_TSR)  ("min" location  item). 
Each  locati on item  has to  be hand led independently . This example o nly covers  the TSR 
location items . 
• 3rd relocation : When the ERTMS/ ETCS on -board reads  BG3, it becomes the new SOLR , so 
that the TSR location it ems are relocated on it: linking distance is  availab le between BG 2 and 
BG3 and it is used for th e relocatio n of the TSR  locati on items , as the last relocati on of the TSR 
locat ion items has been  performed  by clause 3.6.4.2. 5c but not  towards a balise group  received 
earlier than the  former  reference balise group  of the TSR location item s, so: 
➢ the linking distanc e betw een BG2 and B G3, retrieved from l inking i nformation  and 
augmented by twice the location accurac y of BG2, is subtracted from D_TSR . 
➢ the linking distan ce between BG2 and BG3 , retrieve d from linking information  and 
diminish ed by twice the location accurac y of BG2, is subtracted  from (D_TSR  + L_TSR) . 
• 4th relocation : When the ERTMS/ ETCS on -board reads  BG4, it becomes the new SOLR , so 
that the TSR location it ems are relocated on it: linking di stance is  availab le between BG 3 and 
BG4 and it is used as such for th e relocatio n of the TSR  locati on items , as the last relocati on of 
the TSR locat ion items has not been performed  by clause 3.6.4.2. 5c, so: 
➢ the linking distanc e betw een BG3 and B G4, retriev ed from l inking i nformation , is

train length stored as valid Train Data or the safe consist length at the time the train was 
last known to be integer can be used for reporting the train position to  the RBC, which 
will allow the trackside to use the information about the confirmed train rear end position.  
3.6.5.2.2  Driver input of train integrity confirmation shall only be permitted at standstill.  
3.6.5.2.3  The train integrity information reported to the RBC shall consi st of: 
a) Train integrity status information  
• No train integrity information  
• Train integrity confirmed by external  source  
• Train integrity confirmed by driver  
• Train integrity lost  
b) Confirmed train length information (only available when  train integrity confirm ation is 
report ed). 
3.6.5.2.4  The confirmed train length information shall represent the distance between the min safe 
rear end at the time the train was last known to be integer  and the estimated position of 
the train front  at the time when the train integrity inform ation is sent to the RBC (see 
Figure 15) . 
3.6.5.2.4.1  Note: when a confirmation of integrity is received from an external source , this does not 
necessarily mean that the train is complete at the moment that the confirmation is 
received, but rather that the train was k nown to be complete at some time before the 
confirmation of integrity was received. This time will depend on the properties of both the 
external source  and the interface to this source .

Table 2 c: Transition conditions for the train integrity status information to be reported to 
the RBC  
3.6.5.2.6  Following the successful establishment of a communication session with an RBC, the 
train integrity status information to be repor ted to this RBC shall initially be set to "No 
integrity information"  and the conditions of the table 2 c shall be evaluated before sending 
the first position report . 
3.6.5.2.7  Note: As long as no train length is available (captured as valid Train Data or derived from  
the safe consist length information when no valid Train Data is available) or as long as 
the train position is not valid  or not referred to an LRBG,  the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 
equipment cannot report that the train integrity is confirmed, regardless of the t rain 
integrity information received from an external source . Justification: in order to calculate 
the confirmed  train length when reporting a train integrity confirmation, the train position 
must be valid and referred to an LRBG and the train length  must b e available at the time 
of the train integrity confirmation.  
3.6.5.2.8  Note: In order to keep the sending rate of position reports as requested by the RBC, the 
confirmation of train integrity by an external source  does not trigger itself any position 
report. It is o nly in the first position report following the last confirmation of train integrity 
that such confirmation by external source  can be reported. The difference between the 
confirmed  train length and the train length  will then grow to an extent depending on both 
the frequency of the train integrity confirmation and the position report sending rate.  
3.6.5.2.9  Note: When the information "Train integrity lost" is received, the train integrity status 
information is reported in every position report following t he detection of the loss of train 
integrity, until the train integrity is confirmed again, or until the information "Train integrity 
status unknown" is received from the external source , or until the Train Data is 
invalidated.  
3.6.6  Geographical position reporti ng 
3.6.6.1  The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall  display , only on driver request , the 
geographical position of the estimated front end of the train in relation to the track 
kilometre. The display of the geographical position shall also be stopped on driver 
reque st. 
3.6.6.2  The resolution of the position indication shall be 1 metre (sufficient to allow the driver to 
report the train position when communicating with the signalman).   
3.6.6.3  When receiving new geographical position information (from radio or from balise group), 
the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall replace the currently stored geographical 
position information (if any) by this new received one, continuing the ongoing 
geographical position calculation until at least one of the condition of 3.6.6.9 applies.

Principles  Page 67/252 
 3.6.6.4  Geographical position information shall always use a balise group as geographical 
position reference balise group and if needed an offset from that balise group.  A 
geographical position reference balise group shall be either:  
a) part of the last reported bali se groups memorised on -board, in case the information is 
transmitted by  radio, OR  
b) the balise group transmitting the information, in case the information is transmitted by  
balise group, OR  
c) any balise group not yet passed at the time of reception of the info rmation.  
3.6.6.4.1  In case the information is received by radio and at least one of the announced 
geographical position reference balise group(s) is part of the last reported balise groups 
memorised on -board, the on -board equipment shall use the data related to the most 
recently reported balise group.  
3.6.6.4.2  From the currently stored geographical position information, t he track kilometre reference 
given for a geographical reference location shall be come applicable  if the train has 
detected the related geographical reference  balise group and has  travelled the offset 
distance from th is reference balise group.  
3.6.6.4.3  The announced and not applicable geographical references shall be deleted on -board if 
the train changes orientation.  
3.6.6.5  The distance travelled from the geographical referenc e location shall be taken into 
account when calculating the geographical position.  
3.6.6.6  In cases where the track kilometre is not incremental (jumps, changes in counting 
direction, scaling error) the reported position might be wrong between the point of 
irregu larity and the next new reference.   
3.6.6.7  In cases where single balise groups are used as a reference for geographical position 
information and where no linking information is available (and therefore no orientation 
can be assigned to the balise  group ), the on -board equipment shall ignore the 
geographical position information related to these single balise groups . 
3.6.6.8  Intentionally deleted . 
3.6.6.9  The on -board equipment shall continue calculating the position from a track kilometre  
reference (i.e. this track kilometre refe rence shall remain applicable) until:  
a) a new track kilometre reference becomes applicable, OR  
b) it is told not to do so, OR  
c) the calculated geographical position becomes negative, OR 
d) no more geographical position information is available (e.g., deleted accordi ng to 
conditions in SRS chapter 4)  
3.6.6.9.1  Once a track kilometre reference is no longer applicable, it shall be deleted.

3.6.7.1  Independently from the train position in relation to balise groups (see 3.6.1.3), the 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall calculate the remaining distance to be travelled 
by the train in relation to the following distances as soon as their supervision is started 
or re-started:  
a) the maximum distanc e the train can move (National/Default Value) in relation to the 
Roll Away Protection (see section 3.14.2), the Unauthorised Direction Movement 
Protection (see section 3.14.3) and the Standstill supervision (see section 4.4.7.1);  
b) the maximum distance for r eversing (National/Default Value) in Post Trip mode (see 
4.4.14.1.3);  
c) the distance for train trip suppression (National/Default Value) after the Override 
function has been triggered (see clause 5.8.4.1 b));  
d) the fixed distance over which the on -board balise  transmission alarms are ignored, 
before a safety reaction is triggered (see clauses  3.15.7 .2 and 5.22.5.1 a) ); 
e) the fixed distance for small movements in No Power mode (see clause 3.15.8.1.1), in 
relation to the Cold Movement Detection function;

 f) a zero dis tance to the former EOA/LOA for the override de -activation or for the trip 
condition if the override is no longer active, after the Override function has been 
triggered in SB or PT mode while there was no valid train position stored on -board 
(see clauses 5 .8.3.1.1 and 5.8.4.1 c));  
g) the maximum permitted distance to run in Staff Responsible mode when it is 
determined by the National/Default Value, when it is transmitted by the RBC, or when 
it is entered by the driver (see clauses 4.4.11.1.3.1 a) & b)).  
3.6.7.2  For th e supervision of the distances referred in 3.6.7.1 a), b), c), d) & e) the 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall take into account, for the concerned 
direction(s), the estimated distance travelled away from the location when their 
supervision was started/re -started.  
3.6.7.3  For the supervision of the distances referred in 3.6.7.1 f) & g) the ERTMS/ETCS on -
board equipment shall manage a virtual train front position in the following way:  
a) The supervised distance minus the estimated distance travelled away from the 
locat ion when the supervision was started determines the remaining distance from 
the estimated front end position to the end of the supervised distance.  
b) The supervised distance minus the estimated distance travelled away from the 
location when the supervision w as started and minus the odometer under -reading 
amount since the function was activated determines the remaining distance from the 
max(imum) safe front end position to the end of the supervised distance.  
c) The supervised distance minus the estimated distance  travelled away from the 
location when the supervision was started plus the odometer over -reading amount 
since the supervision was started determines the remaining distance from the 
min(imum) safe front end position to the end of the supervised distance.  
3.6.7.3.1  Note 1: The location when the supervision is started/re -started is determined by the 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board (e.g. from a value of its raw position counter) regardless 
whether there is a stored train position in relation to balise group(s).  
3.6.7.3.2  Note 2: This vir tual train position is created at the time the supervision of the distance 
starts and overpassing a balise group does not impact its related estimated, min safe 
and max safe front end positions.  
3.6.7.4  Any virtual train position in relation to such types of supervisi on of distance not referred 
to balise group locations shall be deleted when the related supervision ends  (for the 
distance supervised as per 3.6.7.1 f), see 5.8.3.1.3) . 
3.6.7.5  For the maximum permitted distance to run in Staff Responsible mode, any update of 
this distance through the RBC, the driver or the triggering of the Override while already 
in SR mode shall be considered as a re -start of the supervision, i.e. any related previous 
virtual train position shall be deleted and replaced by a new one as per 3.6.7. 3. 
Conversely, upon reception of new National Values, the related virtual train position shall 
be re -evaluated as per 3.6.7.3 only considering the new National Value.

 3.6.8  Monitoring of odometer accuracy  
3.6.8.1  The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment  monitors the odometer accuracy based on the 
separate accumulation of underestimation and overestimation in measuring the 
movement of the train over a fixed distance.  
3.6.8.1.1  Note: The accumulation of the underestimation/overestimation in measuring the 
movements considers that for both the forward and the backwards movements the 
absolute value contributes separately to the accumulation.  
3.6.8.2  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment  shall store the accumulated 
underesti mation/overestimation in measuring the movements over a defined total 
distance (as defined in A.3.1).  
3.6.8.3  The check of the odometer accuracy shall be performed periodically at fixed distance 
intervals (see 3.6.8.5 and 3.6.8.7).  
3.6.8.4  The distance of the intervals sh all be less than or equal to a defined maximum distance 
interval (as defined in A.3.1).  
3.6.8.5  When performing the check at fixed distance intervals, if any of the accumulated 
underestimation/overestimation in measuring the movements over the defined total 
distan ce travelled (see 3.6.8. 2) exceeds the impairment threshold (as defined in A.3.1) , 
the ERTMS/ ETCS on -board equipment  shall consider the odometer performance 
impaired, and the driver shall be informed.  
3.6.8.5.1  Note: Exceeding the impairment threshold may indicate t hat the odometer accuracy 
exceeds the performance requirement as defined in SUBSET -041 §5.3.1.1.  
3.6.8.6  Once the odometer performance is impaired, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment 
shall continue to consider the odometer performance as impaired until the train ha s 
travelled the defined total distance (as defined in A.3.1 see 3.6.8. 2) with both the 
accumulated underestimation and overestimation in measuring the movements being 
continuously below the "accuracy of distances measured on -board".  
3.6.8.6.1  Note: This means that o nce the odometer performance is impaired, the odometer 
performance will continue to be displayed as being impaired until the train has travelled 
at least again the defined total distance (see 3.6.8. 2). 
3.6.8.6.2  As long as the odometer performance is considered as i mpaired the on -board shall 
inform the driver.  
3.6.8.7  When performing the check at fixed distance intervals, if any of the accumulated 
underestimation/overestimation in measuring the movements over the defined total 
distance travelled (see 3.6.8. 2) exceeds the saf ety threshold (as defined in A.3.1) , the 
ERTMS/ ETCS on -board equipment  shall switch to mode System Failure.

 3.6.8.7.1  Note: The train must not be stopped due to exceeding this safety threshold while 
operating in Level 0 or Level NTC. The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipme nt should 
therefore handle this when entering Level 1  or 2. 
3.6.8.8  If any of the accumulated underestimation/overestimation in measuring the movements 
exceeds the defined values (see 3.6.8.5 and 3.6.8.7) the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 
equipment  shall apply the related r eactions even if the on -board has not travelled the 
whole total distance (see 3.6.8. 2). 
3.7 Completeness of data for safe train movement  
3.7.1  Completeness of data  
3.7.1.1  To control the train movement in an ERTMS/ETCS based system the ERTMS/ETCS on -
board equipment shall b e given information from the trackside system both concerning 
the route set for the train and the track description for that route. The following information 
shall be given from the trackside  
a) Permission and distance to run, the Movement Authority (MA) (see  section 3.8) 
b) When needed, limitations related to the movement authority, i.e. Mode profile for On 
Sight , Limited Supervision  or Shunting and signal ling related speed restriction (see 
sections 3.12.4  and 3.11.6 ). Mode profile and Signalling related Speed restriction shall 
always be sent together with the MA to which the information belongs  
c) Track description covering as a minimum the whole distance defined by the MA. Track 
description includes the following information  
• The Static Speed Profile (SSP) (see section 3.11.3 ). 
• The gradient profile ( see section 3.11.12 ). 
• Optionally Axle load Speed Profile (ASP) (see section 3.11.4 ) 
• Optionally Speed restriction to ensure a given permitted braking distance (see

d) Linking information when available.  
3.7.2  Responsibility for completeness of information  
3.7.2.1  The Movement Authority (MA) shall be given to the on -board equipment  
• Together with the other information (as listed in section 3.7.1.1  c) and d))  
or

 • Separately, if the other information has already been correctly received by the on -
board equipment.  
3.7.2.2  The trackside shall be responsible for that the on -board equipment has received the 
information valid for the distance covered by the Movement Authority.  
3.7.2.2.1  In case of LOA, trackside shall be responsible for including any track description beyond 
the LOA relevan t for calculating safe supervision limits.  
3.7.2.3  The MA and the related mode profile, if any, shall not be accepted by the on -board 
equipment if the SSP and gradient already available on -board or given together with the 
MA do not cover the full length of the MA.  
3.7.2.3.1  For a non -infill MA f ull length means at least from the estimated front end of the train to 
the supervised location , while for an infill MA full length means at least from the infill 
location reference (refer to 3.6.2.3.1) to the supervised location . 
3.7.2.3.2  For an MA that is part of a Supervised Manoeuvre authorisation and whose validity 
direction is opposite to the current train orientation, full length means at least from  the 
estimated front end of the train derived from the new train orientation (see 4.4.21.1. 7 a)) 
to the supervised location.  
3.7.2.4  It shall be possible for  the trackside to send additional information when needed. The 
information referred to is  
• Emergency messages (from RBC only)  
• Request to shorten MA  (from RBC only)  
• Temporary speed restrictions  
• Nation al values  
• Level transition information  
• LX speed restrictions  
• Inhibition of revocable TSRs from balises in level 2 (from RBC only)  
• Virtual Balise Cover orders  
3.7.3  Extension, replacement  and deletion  of location based  information  
3.7.3.1  New track description and linking information shall replace (in the ERTMS/ETCS on-
board equipment) stored information as detailed below:  
a) New Static Speed Profile information shall replace all stored Static Speed Profile 
information from the start location of the new information.  
b) New Gradient Profile information shall replace all stored Gradient Profile information

3.8 Movement authority  
3.8.1  Characteristics of a MA  
3.8.1.1  The following characteristics can be used in a Movement Authority (see Figure 17: 
Structure of an MA ): 
a) The End of Movement Authority is the location to which the train is authorised to move.  
b) When t he Target Speed at the End of Movement Authority is zero, the End of 
Movement Autho rity is called EOA (End of Authority) ; when the target speed is not 
zero, it is called the LOA ( Limit of Authority). This non zero target speed can be time 
limited.  
c) If no overlap exists, the Danger Point is a location beyond the End of Movement 
Authority  that can be reached by the front end of the train without a risk for a 
hazardous situation.  
d) The end of an overlap (if used in the existing interlocking system) is a location beyond 
or at the End of Movement Authority  that can be reached by the front end of  the train 
without a risk for a hazardous situation. This additional distance beyond the End of 
Movement Authority is only valid for a defined time.  
e) A release speed is a speed limit under which the train is allowed to run in the vicinity 
of the End of Move ment Authority , when the target speed is zero. One release speed

Principles  Page 76/252 
 can be associated with the Danger Point, and another one with the overlap. Release 
speed can also be calculated on -board the train (see section 3.13.9.3.6.5 ). 
f) The MA can be split into several sections, The last one is called End Section.  
• A first time -out value can be attached to each section. This value will be use d for 
the revocation of the associated route when the train has not entered into it yet. It is 
called the Section time -out.  
• In addition, a second time -out value can be attached to the End Section of the MA. 
This second time -out will be used for the revoca tion of the last section when it is 
occupied by the train; it is called the End Section time -out. 
3.8.1.2  The values of the time -outs possibly given in an MA shall take into account the time 
elapsed from the start of validity of information to the sending of the m essage.  
3.8.1.3  Note: A Danger Point can be (not exhaustive list):  
• the entry point of an occupied block section (if the line is operated according to fixed 
block principles)  
• the position of the last confirmed  rear end of a train i.e. the position deduced from the 
confirmed  train length information contained in a position report confirming the train 
integrity (if the line is operated according to moving block principles)  
• the fouling point of a switch, positioned for a route, confli cting with the current 
direction of movement of the train (both for fixed and moving block mode of operation)  
3.8.1.4  Note: Traditionally the overlap is a piece of track (beyond the danger point), that is put 
at disposal of a train, to guarantee a non hazardous si tuation, also in case the driver 
should misjudge the stopping distance for the train. In ERTMS/ETCS the overlap can be 
used to improve the efficiency of the braking supervision.  
3.8.1.5  Note: Time -out values can be given in the MA to cope with the following situat ions 
depending on the interlocking operations, i.e. the timers on -board will only reflect the 
situation trackside and when expired (on -board) the actions taken are restrictive:  
a) Section time -out or time -out for the speed at the LOA: When a signalman request s a 
route release of a part of a route not yet entered by the approaching train.  
b) End Section time -out: When the train has entered the last part of a route, the 
automatic route release can be delayed to make sure that the train has come to a 
standstill befo re any switches inside the route can be moved.  
c) Time -out for an overlap: When the train has entered the last part of a route, the overlap 
associated with the route remains valid for a certain time to make sure that the train 
has successfully stopped before its End of Movement A uthority. If the overlap is still 
unoccupied when the timer expires the interlocking revokes the overlap.  
3.8.1.6  Note:  If the trackside equipment does not have enough information to give the distance 
to the End of Movement Authority with a target speed equal to zero , a target speed higher 
than zero can be given (LOA, Limit of Authority). It is the responsibility of the trackside 
to ensure that the safe distance beyond the LOA is long enough to brake the train from

 the target speed to a stand s till without any hazardous situation. It is the responsibility of 
the on -board equipment to apply the brakes if no new information is received when the 
Limit of Authority is passed.  
3.8.2  MA request to the RBC  
3.8.2.1  General  
3.8.2.1.1  The on -board equipment may request a new M ovement Authority from the RBC  for the 
following reasons:  
a) “Start” selection by the driver  (only level 2) 
b) With respect to perturbation location (only level  2) 
c) With respect to MA timer elapsing (only level  2) 
d) Track description deletion (only level  2) 
e) Receptio n of "track ahead free up to the  level 2 transition location"  
3.8.2.1.2  It shall be possible for the RBC to send MA request parameters defining:  
a) whether MA requests shall be repeated and if so, the time between each repetition  
b) the triggering time criterion for the reasons 3.8.2.1.1 b) & c) respectively  
3.8.2.1.3  Note: the MA requests for reasons 3.8.2.1.1 b) & c) can be triggered only if the MA 
request parameters have been received from the RBC.  
3.8.2.1.4  The parameters received from the RBC shall be valid until new MA request para meters 
are received from the RBC.  
3.8.2.1.4.1  Note: This will lead to immediate sending of an MA request in case at the moment the 
new parameters are received, the time since the last sending of an MA request is equal 
to or higher than the new received repetition peri od. 
3.8.2.1.5  As long as at least one reason for sending MA requests is applicable and unless it is 
requested by the RBC not to do so, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall repeat 
the MA requests as indicated by the RBC or with a repetition cycle according to a fixed 
value (see appendix A.3.1) in case no MA request parameters are stored on -board.  
3.8.2.1.6  If a reason for sending MA requests becomes applicable while an MA request repetition 
cycle is already ongoing for another reason, the MA request triggere d for this new reason 
shall reset the repetition cycle.  
3.8.2.1.7  Together with any MA request the on -board shall inform the RBC about the reason(s) 
that is  (are) applicable at the time the MA request is sent . 
3.8.2.2  MA request to the RBC with respect to the perturbation l ocation or MA timer 
elapsing (only level 2) 
3.8.2.2.1  The triggering criteria that can be used by the RBC are the following:

 a) A defined time before the train reaches the perturb ation location  assuming it is running 
at the warning speed  (see section 3.13. 11 for detail s). 
b) A defined time before the Section timer (not the End Section timer, not the Overlap 
timer) for any section of the MA expires , or before the LOA speed timer expires . 
3.8.2.2.2  With r egard to the above possibilities, the MA request shall be triggered when the trai n 
front has passed the location defined by 3.8.2.2.1  a) / when the moment defined by 
3.8.2.2.1 b) is reached.  
3.8.2.2.3  Once the resulting location regard ing 3.8.2.2.1 a) is passed by the train front, the reason 
"Time before reaching the perturbation location reache d" shall remain applicable until 
the triggering criterion is not fulfilled anymore, e.g. due to the reception of a new MA or 
to a temporary EOA that is no longer supervised.  
3.8.2.2.4  Once the defined time before the expiration of a Section timer or before the expir ation of 
the LOA speed timer is reached, the reason "Time before a Section timer/LOA speed 
timer expires reached" shall remain applicable until no Section timer, for which the 
defined time before expiration is reached, is supervised and no LOA, for which t he 
defined time before expiration is reached, is supervised.  
3.8.2.3  MA request to the RBC on driver selecting “Start” (only level 2) 
3.8.2.3.1  An MA request shall be sent to the RBC when the driver selects ”Start”. 
3.8.2.3.2  The reason ""Start" selected  by driver " shall remain applicable until:  
a) an MA is received or  
b) an SR authorisation is received or  
c) the desk is closed.  
3.8.2.4  MA request to the RBC on reception of "track ahead free up to the level 2 transition 
location"  
3.8.2.4.1  If a level 2 transition is announced and a communication session is  already established, 
an MA request shall be sent to the RBC when the information "Track ahead free up to 
level 2 transition location" is received from balise group.  
3.8.2.4.2  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall also inform the RBC about the identity of 
the leve l 2 transition location balise group, as received through the information "Track 
ahead free up to level 2 transition location".  
3.8.2.4.3  By exception to the clause 3.8.2.1.5, only one MA request with the reason "Track ahead 
free up to the level 2 transition locatio n" shall be sent upon reception of the corresponding 
information from balise group.  
3.8.2.5  MA request to the RBC on track description deletion (only level 2) 
3.8.2.5.1  An MA request shall be sent to the RBC when any part of the track description is deleted 
according to A .3.4, except for situations a, b, f, k.

a) Length of the section  
b) Optionally, Section time -out value and distance from beginning of section to Section 
timer stop location  
3.8.3.3  In addition, it shall be possible to define for the End Section of the MA : 
a) End Section time-out value and distance from the End Section timer start loc ation to 
the end of the last section  
b) Danger point information (distance from end of section to danger point, release speed 
related to danger point)

3.8.3.7  In case a main signal is at danger in level 1, the first section shall give the distance from 
the balise group at the main signal to the location of the main signal, i.e. the distance to 
EOA is given. Where available, information concerning danger point and overlap for this 
EOA may also be given.  
3.8.3.7.1  Justification: The balise group is not necessarily placed at the same location as the signal 
and thus an infill message (which includes the same information as the balise group at 
the main signal) c ould change the location of the EOA to a position closer to the train.  
3.8.3.8  Note: In case the main signal is at danger in level 1, the on -board will supervise the given 
distance (specified in section 3.8.3.7 ) as the distance to EOA.

3.8.4  Use of the MA on board the train  
3.8.4.1  End Section Time -Out 
3.8.4.1.1  The End Section timer shall be started on -board when the train passes the End Section 
timer start location given by trackside with its max safe front e nd. 
3.8.4.1.2  When the End Section timer value becomes greater than the time -out value given by 
trackside, the following shall apply:  
a) The EOA/LOA shall be withdrawn to the current position of the train . Refer to appendix 
A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of location bas ed information stored on -board, which shall 
be deleted accordingly;  
b) if any,  a non zero target speed value at the End of Movement Authority  shall be set to 
zero (i.e. an LOA at the End of Movement Authority becomes an EOA withdrawn to 
the current position o f the train) . 
3.8.4.1.3  In case no End Section timer is running when the on -board receives a new MA with an 
End Section timer start location in rear of the max safe front end of the train, the on -
board shall consider that the End Section timer value became greater t han its time -out 
value and apply 3.8.4.1.2.  
3.8.4.1.3.1  Justification: in this case the train is already beyond the timer start location, therefore it 
is impossible to determine when that location was crossed and so what share of the time -
out value has elapsed since t he crossing event. The safe assumption is to consider that 
the time -out value has been exceeded and therefore that the End Section will soon be 
released by the Interlocking.  
3.8.4.1.4  In case an End Section timer is already running when the on -board receives a new M A 
with an End Section timer start location in rear of the max safe front end of the train, the 
on-board shall keep the End Section timer running but replace the time -out value with 
the value received with the new MA.

 3.8.4.1.4.1  Justification: this allows repetition o f the MA via RBC (e.g. acknowledgment of current 
MA was lost) without unintentionally affecting the End Section timer.  
3.8.4.2  Section Time -Outs  
3.8.4.2.1  For each section, t he on -board shall consider  a Section timer that has started : 
a) For Level 2: at the value of the time s tamp of the message including the MA.  
b) For Level 1: at the time of passage over the first encountered balise of the balise 
group giving the MA.  
3.8.4.2.1.1  Justification for b): This is to ensure that the timer is always started before or at the same 
time as the relate d variable information is received. Thus the timer start is independent 
of in which balise the variable information is given.  
3.8.4.2.2  When a Section timer value becomes greater than the time -out value given by trackside , 
the following shall apply  unless an MA sho rtening has occurred  with A.3.4.1.3 condition 
[11] applied : 
a) the EOA /LOA and the SvL shall be withdrawn to the entry point of the revoked section . 
Refer to appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of location based information stored 
on-board, which shall be deleted accordingly ; 
b) the National/ Default Value of the Release Speed shall apply ;  
c) if any, a non zero target speed value at the End of Movement Authority  shall be set to 
zero (i.e. an LOA at the End of Movement Authority becomes an EOA withdrawn to 
the entry point of the revoked section) . 
3.8.4.2.2.1  Justification: Applying 3.8.4.2.2 while the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment has 
considered the current estimated front end and max safe front end positions, as the EOA 
and SvL respectively, with no Release Speed, c ould lead to inappropriate system 
behaviour such as the EOA being moved in advance of the current one or in the sudden 
supervision of a Release Speed allowing the train to move forward . 
3.8.4.2.3  The Section timer shall be stopped when the min safe front end of the train has passed 
the associated Section timer stop location.  
3.8.4.2.4  In case of reverse movement which brings back the min safe front end of the train in rear 
of a Section timer stop location after the Section timer has been stopped according to 
3.8.4.2.3, the on -board shall consider that the Section timer value became greater than 
its time -out value and shall apply 3.8.4.2.2 once the train has reached standstill.  
3.8.4.2.5  If, upon its evaluation, a new MA includes a section with its timer stop location already in 
rear of t he min safe front end of the train, the on -board shall consider that the Section 
timer had been stopped before its value could become greater than its time -out value 
and shall not apply 3.8.4.2.2.  
3.8.4.2.5.1  Justification: in this case the train is already beyond the  timer stop location, therefore it 
is impossible to determine when that location was crossed and so what share of the time -
out value has elapsed before the crossing event. Knowing the above on -board

 behaviour, it is always the trackside responsibility to t ake the appropriate measures to 
ensure a safe release of the corresponding section.  
3.8.4.3  Time -out of the speed associated with the End of Movement Authority ( LOA  speed 
time out)  
3.8.4.3.1  For the LOA speed, t he on -board shall consider  a timer that has started : 
a) For Level 2: at the value of the time stamp of the message including the MA.  
b) For Level 1: at the time of passage over the first encountered balise of the balise 
group giving the MA.  
3.8.4.3.1.1  Justification for b): This is to ensure that the timer is always started before or a t the same 
time as the related variable information is received. Thus the timer start is independent 
of in which balise the variable information is given.  
3.8.4.3.2  When the LOA speed timer value becomes greater than the time-out value given by 
trackside , the speed associated with the LOA shall be set to zero (i.e. the Limit of 
Authority becomes an End of Authority  and the SvL is defined on -board according to 
3.8.4.5) . Refer to appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of location based information 
stored on -board, whic h shall be deleted accordingly.  
3.8.4.4  Time -out of Overlap  
3.8.4.4.1  The Overlap timer shall be started on -board when the train passes the Overlap timer 
start location given by trackside with its max safe front end.  The timer shall be considered 
as started even if a time -out value “infinite” is given.  
3.8.4.4.2  When the Overl ap timer value becomes greater than the time -out value given by 
trackside, the following shall apply:  
a) the overlap information shall be deleted  and the Supervised Location shall be  
determined in accordance with 3.8.4.5 . Refer to appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list 
of location based information stored on -board, which shall be deleted accordingly.  
b) the release speed associated with the Overlap shall be deleted  
c) if any, a non zero target speed value  at the End of Movement Authority  shall be set to 
zero (i.e. an LOA at the End of Movement Authority becomes an EOA) . 
3.8.4.4.3  If the train comes to a standstill after the Overlap timer has been started, the on-board 
shall consider that the Overlap timer value beca me greater than its time -out value and 
shall apply 3.8.4.4.2 . 
3.8.4.4.4  In case no Overlap timer is running when the on -board receives a new MA with an 
Overlap timer start location in rear of the max safe front end of the train, the on -board 
shall consider that the Overlap timer value became greater than its time -out value and 
shall apply 3.8.4.4.2.  
3.8.4.4.4.1  Justification: in this case the train is already beyond the timer start location, therefore it 
is impossible to determine when that location was crossed and so what share  of the time -

Principles  Page 84/252 
 out value has elapsed since the crossing event. The safe assumption is to consider that 
the time -out value has been exceeded and therefore that the Overlap will soon be 
released by the Interlocking.  
3.8.4.4.5  In case an Overlap timer is already running when the on -board receives a new MA with 
an Overlap timer start location in rear of the max safe front end of the train, the on -board 
shall keep the Overlap timer running but replace the Overlap time-out value with the 
value received with the new MA.  
3.8.4.4.5.1  Justification: this allows repetition of the MA via RBC (e.g. acknowledgment of current 
MA was lost) without unintentionally affecting the Overlap timer.  
3.8.4.5  Supervised Location  
3.8.4.5.1  Unless stated otherwise, t he Supervised Location  (SvL) shall be defined on -board a s: 
a) the end of overlap (if any and before time -out). 
b) if not, the Danger Point (if any).  
c) if not, the end of the End Section . 
3.8.4.5.2  As long as a Limit of Authority is supervised, no SvL shall be defined on -board.  
3.8.4.6  Infill MA (level 1 only)  
3.8.4.6.1  An MA given by an infill de vice is called an infill MA.  
3.8.4.6.2  An infill MA shall be evaluated on -board only if the on -board equipment is in FS , AD or 
LS mode.  
3.8.4.6.3  The infill information shall include the identity of the balise group at the next main signal 
i.e. the identity of the balise group giving the information that is transmitted in advance 
by the infill device.  
3.8.4.6.4  An infill MA shall be evaluated on -board only if the linking information, regarding the main 
signal balise group to which it refers, is available.  
3.8.4.6.5  The on -board shall s tart a Section timer for each section beyond the next main signal:  
a) When the infill information is received from a balise group at the time of passing the 
first encountered balise of the infill balise group.  
b) When the infill information is received from a lo op at the time of receiving the loop 
message . 
c) When the infill information is received from a radio infill unit at the value of the time 
stamp of the radio infill message including the MA.  
3.8.5  MA Update  
3.8.5.1  A new MA shall replace a previously received  MA in the fol lowing ways :

Principles  Page 85/252 
 a) When the new MA is given from a balise group at a main signal (i.e. no n-infill 
information) or from the RBC all data included in the previous MA shall be replaced 
by the new data.  
b) When the new MA is given as infill information all data beyond  the announced balise 
group at the next main signal shall be replaced.  
3.8.5.1.1  Note: This refers to all information included in the MA as listed in section 3.8.1.1  and the 
Signalling related speed restriction (see section 3.11.6 ). 
3.8.5.1.2  When an infill MA is received, the on -board shall start a new MA sectio n at the infill 
location reference, i.e. the balise group at the next main signal (see 3.6.2.3.1).  
3.8.5.1.3  If the SvL defined from the new MA is closer than the one supervised with the former 
MA, this shall be considered by the on -board equipment as an MA shorteni ng. Refer to 
appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of location based information stored on -board, 
which shall be deleted accordingly.  
3.8.5.1.4  If a new MA defines an SvL while the on -board was supervising an LOA, this shall always 
be considered by the on -board equ ipment as an MA shortening regardless of the SvL 
location. Refer to appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of location based information 
stored on -board, which shall be deleted accordingly.  
3.8.5.1.5  On reception of a shortened MA sent together with other location based information, the 
deletion of information referred to in the clauses 3.8.5.1.3 and 3.8.5.1.4 shall apply to the 
information stored on -board prior to the reception of this trackside information, before 
any clause dealing with the replacement o f information (e.g. 3.7.3.1 or 3.18.2.9 first 
bullet) is applied.  
3.8.5.2  It shall be possible to update the length of an MA  section by means of repositioning 
information contained in a balise group message (see section 3.8.5.3 ). 
3.8.5.2.1  Note: The concerned MA  section need not be the end section.  
3.8.5.2.2  Upon reception of r epositioning information and only  if linking information has announced 
a following balise group as unk nown but containing repositioning information , the on -
board shall update the length of the current MA section in which the train front end is . 
3.8.5.2.3  A balise group message containing a non-infill movement authority shall not contain 
repositioning information for the same direction.  
3.8.5.2.3.1  Note: It is possible to combine repositioning with an infill MA.  
3.8.5.2.4  The reception of repositioning information or of a new MA with an LOA shall not be 
considered as an MA shortening by the on -board equipment.  
3.8.5.3  Examples of MA  update

3.8.6  Co-operative shortening of MA (Level 2 only)  
3.8.6.1  It shall be possible to shorten a g iven MA using a special procedure between on -board 
equipment and RBC. The procedure is as follows:  
a) The RBC sends a request to shorten MA, which includes a propose d shortened  MA 
with an E OA closer to the train than the current EOA/LOA , optionally with a mod e 
profile  and in case of SH mode profile optionally with a list of balise  group s for SH 
area.

Principles  Page 92/252 
 b) The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall check the train front end position versus 
the Indication supervision limit of the proposed shortened MA . 
• If it is in rear , the request shall be accepted and the on-board equipment shall 
consider the proposed shortened MA as  the new MA, together with its 
accompanying mode profile (if any) and list of balise  group s for SH area (if any) . 
• If it is in advance , the request shall be  rejected and the previously received MA , 
mode profile (if any) and list of balise  group s for SH area (if any) shall  remain valid  
c) The RBC shall be informed about the decision.  
3.8.6.2  If the request from the RBC is granted by the on -board, refer to appendix A.3.4 for the 
exhaustive list of location based information, which shall be deleted accordingly.  
3.9 Means to transmit Infill information (Level 1 only)  
3.9.1  General  
3.9.1.1  It shall be possible to transmit infill information to the on -board equipment using  
a) Balise groups  
b) Euroloops  
c) Radio infill units.  
3.9.1.1.1  If the information transmitted by Balise groups, Euroloops, and Radio includes infill 
information, those devices are al so identified as infill devices.  
3.9.1.2  The principle used for the infill information is the same independent of t ransmission 
media.  
3.9.1.3  If the on -board system is not equipped with the infill transmission media as requested by 
the announcement balise group, the announcement information shall be ignored by the 
on-board equipment and the train shall proceed according to the  previously received 
information.  
3.9.1.4  Note: No additional description is needed for infill by balise group (other than already 
covered in previous chapters).

3.9.3  Infill by radio  
3.9.3.1  In level 1 areas it shall be possible to send to the on -board equipment orders to 
establish/terminate a communication session with a radio infill unit.  
3.9.3.2  The orders shall be sent via balise groups  or via Radio Infill units .

3.9.3.5  If the order to establish a communication ses sion with a radio infill unit sent via balise 
groups is received , the on-board equipment  shall, once the location indicated in the order 
is reached : 
a) terminate any existing communication session(s) with RIU(s) not indicated in the order  
b) as soon as a new com munication session can be handled, establish a communication

3.9.3.6.1  Exception (degraded situation): if the on -board can handle o nly one communication 
session  established with the GSM -R radio system , the order shall be ignored.  
3.9.3.7  A Radio Infill Unit shall not initiate a communication session with an on -board equipment.  
3.9.3.8  The order to establish/terminate a communication session sent via balise groups shall 
be sent together with the following radio infill area information:  
a) Location where to perform the action (referred to the balise group containing the 
order). Note: if the action is to establish a communication session, this location marks  
the beginning of the Radio Infill Area.  
b) Next main signal balise group identifier ( ignored by the on -board  if the action is 
Terminate communication session). Note: the reference location of this balise group 
marks the end of the Radio Infill Area.  
3.9.3.8.1  The order  to establish/terminate a communication session sent via Radio Infill units (see 
3.5.3.6) shall not be sent together with any radio infill area information.  
3.9.3.9  The establishment of a communication session for radio infill shall not change the 
operational leve l of the on -board i.e. the information in the balise group shall be taken 
into account as usual in level 1.  
3.9.3.10  The on -board equipment shall inform the radio infill unit  
a) As soon as the location indicated in the order sent via balise groups is passed (i.e. 
entry of the train in the infill area)  
b) As soon as the next main signal balise group indicated in the order sent via balise 
groups is read or the on -board equipment detects that it was missed.  
3.9.3.11  The information sent to the radio infill unit by the on -board equi pment shall include  
a) Train identity (ETCS -ID of the on -board equipment)  
b) Position report  
c) Identifier of the next main signal balise group  
d) Time stamp  
3.9.3.11.1  Justification:  
a) The train identity is used for conformity with other train to track messages  
b) The identifier of the next main signal balise group allows the radio infill unit to identify 
safely where the train is going, even in the case of a points area  
3.9.3.12  As soon as the radio infill unit is informed that a train has entered an infill area  under  its 
respo nsibility , it shall

 a) Terminate a possible previous sending of infill information to the on -board equipment , 
AND  
b) Send cyclically the infill information corresponding to the message currently sent by 
the next main signal balise group indicated in the informat ion from the on -board

3.9.3.13  The radio infill unit shall terminate the sending of infill information as soon as i nformation 
is received, that the on -board equipment has read the next main signal balise group 
indicated in the order or that the on -board equipment has detected that it was missed.  
3.9.3.14  The radio infill unit shall evaluate the time stamp according to the princ iples of section

3.9.3.15  When the on -board equipm ent reads the next main signal balise group or when it detects 
that the next main signal balise group was missed, new infill information related to this 
balise group possibly received shall be ignored.  
3.9.3.16  The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall terminate the communication session

3.11 Static Speed Restrictions and Gradients  
3.11.1  Introduction  
3.11.1.1  The permitted speed at which the train is allowed to travel shall be limited to different 
kinds of Static Speed Restrictions.  
3.11.1.2  A Static Speed Restriction shall be handled in the same way independent of ETCS level.  
3.11.2  Definition of Static Speed Restriction  
3.11.2.1  Static Speed Restrictions are imposed by the t rackside infrastructure, the train 
characteristics, the signalling and the mode of the on -board equipment.  
3.11.2.2  There are eleven  categories of Static Speed Restrictions:   
a) Static Speed Profile (SSP)  
b) Axle load Speed Profile (ASP)  
c) Temporary Speed Restrictions (TS R) 
d) Maximum Train Speed  
e) Signalling related speed restriction (only level 1)  
f) Mode related Speed Restriction.

piece of track. The speed restrictions can be related to e.g. maximum line speed, curves, 
points, tunnel profiles, bridges.

 3.11.3.1.2  The Static Speed Profile is based on factors,  which are both track and train dependent. 
The relationship between track and train characteristics determine s the individual Static 
Speed Profile for each train.  
3.11.3.1.3  It shall be possible for every element (distance between two discontinuities) of a static 
speed profile to define, if a transition to a higher speed limit than the speed limit specified 
for this element is permitted before the complete train has left the element.  
3.11.3.2  Static Speed Profile Categories  
3.11.3.2.1  It shall be possible to transmit  several  Static Spee d Profile Categories; one Basic SSP 
category and specific SSP categories related to the international train categories.  
3.11.3.2.1.1  The specific SSP categories are decomposed into two types:  
a) The “Cant Deficiency” SSP categories: the cant deficiency value assigned to o ne 
category shall define the maximum speed, determined by suspension design, at which 
a particular train can traverse a curve and thus can be used to set a specific speed 
limit in a curve with regards to this category.  
b) The “other specific” SSP categories: it groups all other specific SSP categories 
corresponding to the other international train categories  
3.11.3.2.1.2  Whenever the type of specific SSP category is not explicitly specified in the following 
requirements, it shall be interpreted as being applicable for both  types of specific SSP 
categories.  
3.11.3.2.2  For each part of the Static Speed Profile, the ERTMS/ETCS trackside shall:  
a) always give the Basic SSP, which shall be considered as the default “Cant Deficiency” 
SSP 
b) optionally give one or more specific SSPs  
c) specify, for each “other specific” SSP, whether it replaces or not the “Cant Deficiency” 
SSP as selected by the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment according to 3.11.3.2.3  
3.11.3.2.3  For each part of the Static Speed Profile, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall 
select the SSP best suiting its “Cant Deficiency” train category, according to the following 
order of preference:  
a) if available, the “Cant Deficiency” SSP matching its “Cant Deficiency” train category, 
OR 
b) if available, the “Cant Deficiency” SSP with the highest Ca nt Deficiency value below 
the value of its “Cant Deficiency” train category, OR

 3.11.3.2.6  For each part of the Static Spee d Profile, t he ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment in a 
train belonging to at least one or more “other international” train categories shall use the 
most restrictive speed amongst:  
a) the ” Cant Deficiency” SSP as selected in 3.11.3.2.3, only if none of the “other specific” 
SSP categories matching the train categories replaces the ” Cant Deficiency” SSP, 
AND  
b) all the “other specific ” SSP categories matching the “other international” train 
categories.  
3.11.3.3  Train categories  
3.11.3.3.1  A maximum of 31 train categories is defined to match the SSP categories. 16 “Cant 
Deficiency”  train categor ies and 15 “other international”  train categories.  
3.11.3.3.2  A train shall always belong to one and only one “Cant Deficiency”  train category  and may 
optionally belong to one or more “other inte rnational” train categor ies. 
3.11.3.3.3  The train categor y(ies) to which a train belongs is a part of its Train Data.  
3.11.4  Axle load Speed Profile  
3.11.4.1  It shall be possible to define an Axle load Speed Profile as a non -continuous profile.  
3.11.4.2  For each section with a speed restrict ion due to axle load, it shall be possible to transmit  
one or more axle load category speed restriction s. 
3.11.4.2.1  Intentionally deleted . 
3.11.4.3  The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment  shall only consider the speed restriction that is 
associated with  the axle load category matching  that of the train.  
3.11.4.3.1  Note: As a consequence, it is the trackside responsibility to provide the axle load 
category speed restrictions taking into account the different axle load categories of the 
trains suitable to operate on the l ine.

3.11.4.5  The initial state for Axle load Speed Profile shall be “no restriction due to axle load”.  
3.11.4.6  Whether a speed increase after the axle load speed restriction shall be delayed with train 
length, shall be determined by the axle load sp eed profile information sent to the on -
board equipment.  
3.11.5  Temporary Speed Restrictions  
3.11.5.1  The temporary speed restriction is defined in order to enable a separate category of track 
infrastructure speed restriction, which can be used for working areas etc.

 3.11.5.2  All Temporary Speed Restrictions are independent of each other. This means that an 
individual Temporary Speed Restriction cannot affect, nor be affected by, any other 
individu al Temporary Speed Restriction.  
3.11.5.3  Whether a speed increase after the temporary speed res triction shall be delayed with 
train length, shall be determined by the temporary speed restriction information sent to 
the on -board equipment.  
3.11.5.4  When two or more temporary speed restrictions overlap, the most restrictive speed of 
the overlapping temporary s peed restrictions shall be used in the area of overlap.  
3.11.5.5  Each Temporary Speed Restriction shall have an identity to make it possible to revoke 
the Temporary Speed Restriction using its identity. The speed restriction shall be 
revoked immediately when revoca tion is received from trackside, without delay for the 
train length.  
3.11.5.6  It shall be possible to identify whether a Temporary Speed Restriction is possible to 
revoke or not.  
3.11.5.7  A new Temporary Speed Restriction shall not replace a previously received Temporary 
Speed Restriction with another identity.  
3.11.5.8  Temporary Speed Restrictions shall only be revoked on request from the trackside.  
3.11.5.9  If the on -board equipment receives a new Temporary Speed Restriction (TSR) with the 
same identity as an already received TSR, the new  Temporary Speed Restriction shall 
replace the previous one, except when the Temporary Speed Restriction is identified as 
non revocable in which case this shall be considered as an additional TSR.  
3.11.5.10  In case the train has changed its orientation any Temporary  Speed Restriction shall be 
deleted (operational requirement: will be executed due to the mode change).  
3.11.5.11  Intentionally deleted.  
3.11.5.12  It shall be possible for the RBC to order an ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment in Level 
2 to reject revocable TSRs from balises.

TSRs from balises, this inhibition shall be stored and shall be effective immediately, but 
only for revocable TSRs received from balises thereafter.  
3.11.5.14  The inhibition of re vocable TSRs from balises  shall be deleted if any of the following 
occurs:  
• the communication session established with the RBC that ordered the inhibition is 
terminated, OR  
• in case of RBC/RBC handover, the max safe front end of the train crosses the 
RBC/RBC  border.  
3.11.5.15  Note: this inhibition may be useful in Level 1 / Level 2 mixed signalling applications when 
the RBC has more precise information about restrictions than can be given from balises.

3.11.6  Signalling related speed restrictions  
3.11.6.1  In level 1, it shall be possible to send to the on -board equipment a speed restriction with 
a value depending on the current state of signalling.  
3.11.6.2  This speed value shall be  taken into account by the on -board equipment as soon as it is 
received on -board, with the exception of a signalling related speed restriction from an 
infill device. In case of infill information the speed restriction shall be taken into account 
from the l ocation reference of the balise group at the next main signal.  
3.11.6.3  The speed restriction shall be valid until a new signalling related speed restriction is 
received.  
3.11.6.3.1  If the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment switches from level 1 to level 2, the signalling 
related speed restriction shall remain valid until a level 2 MA is accepted by the 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment  
3.11.6.4  In case of a signal at danger the signalling related speed restriction shall have value  
zero, which shall be evaluated by the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equip ment not as a speed 
limit but as a train trip order.  
3.11.6.5  In case of infill information the signalling related speed restriction at zero shall be ignored.  
3.11.6.5.1  Note: The infill information will also include an EOA at the next main signal that will be 
supervised acco rding to the normal rules.  
3.11.7  Mode related speed restrictions  
3.11.7.1  The value of the mode related speed restriction shall be determined by the corresponding 
national value or the corresponding default values if the national values are not 
applicable.  
3.11.7.1.1   Exception  1: For the modes On -sight , Limited Supervision  and Shunting the speed limit 
can also be given from the trackside. The speed limit given from the trackside shall 
prevail over the National value and the default value.  
3.11.7.1.2  Exception 2: For the mode s Reversing and Supervised Manoeuvre there is no 
National/Default value. The speed limit is always given from trackside.   
3.11.7.1.3  Exception 3: For the mode Staff Responsible the speed limit can also be entered by the 
driver. The speed limit given by the driver shal l prevail over the National/Default value.  
3.11.8  Train related speed restriction

3.11.10  Override function related Speed Restriction  
3.11.10.1  While the “override” function is active, the override speed limit (national /default value) 
shall be taken into account.  
3.11.11  Speed restriction to ensure permitted braking distance  
3.11.11.1  It shall be possible for trackside to request the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment to 
calculate a speed restriction based on a permitted braking distance  given by trackside . 
3.11.11.2  The order shall be given by means of  a non -continuous profile defining:  
• The start and end location for the speed restriction  
• The permitted braking distance (PBD) used to calculate the speed restriction value  
• Whether the permitted braking distance is to be achieved with the Service Brake or 
Emergency Brake  
• A single gradient value applicable for the calculation  
3.11.11.3  The speed restriction shall be calculated when the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment 
receives the permitted braking distance information from trackside, and shall be re -
calculated only if any of the inputs taken into account for the calculation of the speed 
restriction changes.  
3.11.11.4  The calculation of the speed restriction by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall 
take into account that : 
• The single gradient value received from trackside shall be compensated in value 
according to the rotating mass as defined in 3.13.4.3 . 
• The safe deceleration shall be computed as in 3.13.6.2.1 but without considering the 
adhesion profiles , the track conditions related to brake inhibition and the track 
conditions re lated to powerless section given by trackside.  
• The expected deceleration shall be computed as in 3.13.6.3.1 but without considering 
the track conditions related to brake inhibition and the track conditions related to 
powerless section given by trackside.  
• The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall calculate an Emergency Brake 
Deceleration (EBD) curve based on the safe deceleration and that reaches zero 
speed at a distance equal to the permitted braking distance.  
• If the permitted braking distance is to be achiev ed with the service brake, the 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall also calculate a Service Brake Deceleration 
(SBD) curve based on the expected deceleration and that reaches zero speed at a 
distance equal to the permitted braking distance.

 • The estimated a cceleration shall be set to “zero”.  
• If not inhibited by National Value, the compensation of the inaccuracy of the speed 
measurement shall be set to a value calculated from the PBD speed, as defined in 
SUBSET -041 § 5.3.1.2: V_delta0PBD = f 41(V_PBD + dV_EBI( V_PBD)) if the 
permitted braking distance is to be achieved with the emergency brake; V_delta0PBD 
= f41(V_PBD + dV_SBI(V_PBD)) if the permitted braking distance is to be achieved 
with the service brake.  
• The train will travel a distance from the last encoun tered balise of a group that 
provides restrictive information until initiating the brake command. This travelled 
distance shall be set to a value calculated from the PBD speed considering a 
processing delay (T 41) equal to SUBSET -041 § 5.2.1.1.  
• Regardless o f how the service brake feedback is actually configured (see 
3.13.2.2.7.2), T_bs1 and T_bs2 (see 3.13.9.3.3) shall be defined as if the service 
brake feedback was not implemented.  
• Regardless of how the traction cut -off interface is actually configured (see  3.13.2.2.8), 
T_traction (see 3.13.9.3.2) shall be defined as if the traction cut -off was not 
implemented.  
3.11.11.4.1  Note: Knowing how the PBD speed restriction is computed by the ERTMS/ETCS on -
board equipment, it is the responsibility of the trackside to set the ap propriate permitted 
braking distance with regard to the risk of not initiating the brake command in due time 
when encountering a further balise group providing restrictive information. In other 
words, if deemed necessary, the trackside can include provisio ns based on the 
characteristics of the balise group providing restrictive information e.g. distances 
between balises in that group with regards to validity direction of transmitted information 
and balise group orientation, accuracy of balise location.  
3.11.11.4.2  Note : If the permitted braking distance is to be achieved with the service brake , it is the 
responsibility of the trackside to also consider an estimation of the on-board over-reading 
and under -reading amounts at the time the brake command is initiated in order to lower 
the likelihood of the max safe front end of the train reaching the EBI supervision limit.  
3.11.11.5  Note: Throughout the following formulas, all the distances marked with “d” (lower case) 
are counted from a single arbitrary reference location.  
3.11.11.6  If the permitted braking distance is to be achieved with the emergency brake, the 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall seek the PBD speed restriction value (V_PBD) 
which satisfies  the two following inequalities. The resulting value shall then be rounded 
down to the next lower multiple of 5km/h:

3.12.1  Track Conditions  
3.12.1.1  The Track Condition function is used to inform the driver and/or the train of a condition 
in front of t he train.  
3.12.1.2  A Track Condition shall be given as profile data (e.g. non -stopping area), i.e. start and 
end of the data is given, or location data (e.g. change of traction system ) i.e. start location 
given, depending on the type of track condition.  
3.12.1.2.1  The start ing point of a profile type track condition shall be evaluated taking into account 
the max safe front end of the train, the end of the profile taking into account the min safe 
rear end of the train. Location type data shall be evaluated taking into account  the max 
safe front of the train.  
3.12.1.2.1.1  Note: The timing of output data to control train equipment (e.g. pantograph) is 
application specific.  
3.12.1.2.1.2  Exception  1: The starting point of a Big Metal Mass type track condition shall be 
evaluated taking into account the max safe antenna  position, the end of the profile taking 
into account the min safe antenna  position.  
3.12.1.2.1.3  Exception 2: The end of the Powerless section and the end of the Station Platform 
shall be evaluated taking into account the min safe front end of the train.  
3.12.1.2.1.4  Exception 3: The start and end of a tunnel stopping area and of a sound horn track 
condition shall be evaluated taking into account the estimated fr ont end of the train . 
3.12.1.2.1.5  Exception 4: The start and end of a radio hole shall be evaluated taking into account 
the estimated position of the front /rear and rear /front  ends of the engine respectively , 
depending on whether the train orientation is the same as/opposite to the active cab . 
3.12.1.2.1.5.1  Note: it is assumed that all the radio antennas are installed on the engine . 
3.12.1.3  The types of track conditions to be covered by this function are:

3.12.1.5.1  Note: Whether some information shall be filtered (not shown to the  driver or not sent to 
an ERTMS/ETCS external function ) is outside the scope of ERTMS/ETCS.  
3.12.1.5.2  Note: The ERTMS/ETCS external function must be able to handle new track condition 
of the same type as previously received and covering the same distance.  
3.12.1.6  The train is permitted to run without any track condition information given from the 
trackside. The initial state shall then be used by the on -board equipment.  
3.12.2  Route Suitability  
3.12.2.1  Route suitability data defines which values concerning loading gauge, traction system  
and axle load category a train must meet to be allowed to enter the route.  
3.12.2.2  It shall be possible for trackside to send  route suitability data as location data when 
needed.  
3.12.2.3  On reception of route suitability data, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall 
compar e it with the corresponding Train Data stored on -board.  Unsuitability exists if:  
a) The loading gauge profile of the train is not included in the list of loading gauges 
accepted by trackside  
b) The list of traction systems  accepted by the engine  does not include the one received 
from trackside  
c) The axle load category of the train is not included  in the list of permitted one s received 
from trackside  
3.12.2.3.1  Exception to 3.12.2.3 b): If the engine is able to run on a line not fitted with any traction 
system , unsuitability never exists.  
3.12.2.4  If at least one unsuitability exists, the closest location corresponding to the 
unsuitability(ies) shall be considered as both temporary  EOA and SvL, with no Release 
Speed. The driver shall be inform ed about all unsuitabilit ies. 
3.12.2.5  The temporary EOA and SvL are entities distinct from the EOA and SvL continuously 
supervised by the on -board. Unless specified otherwise, all the instances of the terms 
EOA or SvL used in this document do not refer to these temporary EOA/SvL .

ERTMS/ETCS system.  
3.12.2.10  The train is permitted to run without any route suitability data given from the track. No 
default values shall be used or supervised by the on -board equipment, i.e. the initial state 
is that no restrictions related to route suitabilit y exists.  
3.12.3  Text Transmission  
3.12.3.1  General Rules  
3.12.3.1.1  It shall be possible to transmit information to be displayed to the driver from the trackside

b) whether the stopping  of the train in rear of the LX start location is required or not  
3.12.5.7  In case stopping in rear of the non protected LX is required, a stopping area in rear of 
the LX start location shall be defined.  
3.12.5.8  In case the LX is not protected , the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equi pment  shall consider

3.13 Speed and distance monitoring  
3.13.1  Introduction  
3.13.1.1  The speed and distance monitoring is the supe rvision of the speed of the train versus its 
position, in order to assure that the train remains within the given speed and distance 
limits.

 3.13.1.1.1  Note: The speed and distance monitoring of the on -board can only assure this when the 
following necessary condition s are fulfilled:  
• Brake system of the train functions as specified  
• wheel/rail adhesion is sufficient for the required safe deceleration  
• Brake characteristics (and other Train related inputs ) are correctly entered into the 
on-board  
3.13.1.2  Note: The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment triggers brake commands and revokes 
them, it may also receive status information if the brakes are applied or released. 
However, it cannot be made responsible if brake control circuits outside the equipment 
fail. Also the way the brakes are r eleased by the driver after a revocation of a brake 
command is an implementation issue.

 3.13.1.4  Throughout the following sections, all the distances marked with “d” (lower case), which 
are referred in parameters, formulas and figures, are counted from the single  reference 
location of the on -board equipment for the supervision of distances (i.e. the SOLR). 
3.13.1.5  When the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment applies at least one of the clauses 
3.12.2.4, 3.12.4.7 and 3.12.5.8, all the instances of the terms EOA and SvL in this section 
3.13 shall refer to the closest location amongst the temporary EOA(s) and the EOA and 
to the closest location amongst the temporary SvL(s) and the SvL, respectively.  
3.13.2  Inputs for speed and distance monitoring  
3.13.2.1  Introduction  
3.13.2.1.1  The traction / braking models, the brake position / brake percentage are used for the 
definition of the kinematic behaviour of the train after a service brake command or an 
emergency brake command has been initiated.  
3.13.2.1.2  However, railway brakes have a statistical behaviour and braking distances vary within 
the typical distribution for a given condition. Correction factors  are therefore incorporated 
for the speed and distance monitoring.  
3.13.2.1.3  The correction factors will allow obtaining, from the nominal emergency braking 
performance of the train, the minimum emergency braking performances that are 
required  for reference conditio ns set by trackside . 
3.13.2.2  Train related inputs  
3.13.2.2.1  Introduction  
3.13.2.2.1.1  The train related inputs to be considered for the speed and distance monitoring are:  
a) Traction model  
b) Braking models (brake reaction time, brake build up time and speed dependent 
deceleration) or brake p ercentage  
c) Brake position  
d) Special brakes  (interface configuration and status)  
e) Service brake (interface  configuration and application)  
f) Traction cut -off interface  
g) On-board correction factors  
h) Nominal rotating mass  
i) Train length  
j) Fixed values related to speed and  distance monitoring  
k)  Train related speed restriction (i.e. the maximum train speed)

 3.13.2.2.1.2  These train related inputs are acquired as Train Data (see 3.18.3.2 items b) c) and 
d)), except:  
• the configuration of the special brakes, service brake and traction cut -off interfaces 
which are not affected by the Train Data acquisition,  
• the service brake application and the special brakes statuses which are continuously 
acquired on the Train Interface,  
• the fixed values.  
3.13.2.2.1.3  The speed and distance monitoring shall use braking models acquired as Train Data, 
unless the brake percentage is acquired as Train Data and the conversion model is 
applicable (see 3.13.3.2 for its validity limits) . 
3.13.2.2.2  Traction model  
3.13.2.2.2.1  The traction model shall be given as a step function as indicated in Figure 29. 
Depending on whether the traction cut -off command is implemented or not (see 
3.13.2.2.8.1), i t shall describe the nominal traction cut -off time (T_traction_cut_off ) 
counted from the moment when either the traction cut -off command or the emergency 
brake command is respectively triggered by the on -board (t0) to the moment the 
acceleration due to traction (A_traction) is zero (t1). The estimated acceleration value of 
the train shall be considered during this time.

acceleration due to gradient . 
3.13.2.2.3  Braking Models  
3.13.2.2.3.1  Speed Dependent Deceleration  
3.13.2.2.3.1.1  The deceleration due to braking shall be given as a step function of the speed.  
3.13.2.2.3.1.2  It shall be possible to define up  to seven steps for each speed dependent deceleration 
model.  
3.13.2.2.3.1.3  Note: An example with 4 steps is given in Figure 30. A_brake(V) is calculated as

3.13.2.2.3.1.4  The last step o f A_brake(V)  shall by definition be considered as open ended, i.e. it 
has no upper speed limit.  
3.13.2.2.3.1.5  The model shall be applicable only after full build up of the braking effort (see a_full 
in Figure 31) 
3.13.2.2.3.1.6  The model shall be used for the emergency brake nominal deceleration 
(A_brake_emergency(V)), for the full service brake deceleration (A_brake_service(V)) 
and for the normal service brake deceleration (A_brake_normal_service(V)).  
3.13.2.2.3.1.7  It shall be possible to define individual speed dependent deceleration models of 
A_brake_emergency(V) and A_brake_service(V)  for each combination of use of 
regenerative brake, eddy current brake and magnetic shoe brake.  
3.13.2.2.3.1.8  Note: Individual deceleration models may be equal, thereby avoiding the influence of 
a specific brake on A_brake_emergency(V) or A_brake_service(V). However, the choice 
to take into account or not  the contribution of a specific brake for A_brake_emergency(V) 
or A_brake_service(V) is only rolling stock dependent, not an ETCS implementation 
issue.  
3.13.2.2.3.1.9  It shall be possible to define up to two sets of three models of 
A_brake_normal_service(V):  
a) one set appl icable when the brake position is in “Freight train in G”  
b) one set applicable when the brake position is in “Passenger train in P” or “Freight train

 3.13.2.2.3.1.10  A set of A_brake_normal_service(V) shall be defined as a function of the full 
service brake deceleration at zero speed, A_brake_service(V=0):  
If A_brake_service(V = 0)  A_SB01  
A_brake_normal_service(V) = A_brake_normal_service_0(V)  
if A_SB01 < A_brake_service(V = 0)  A_SB12  
A_brake_normal_service(V) = A_brake_normal_service_1(V)  
if A_SB12 < A_b rake_service (V = 0)  
A_brake_normal_service(V) = A_brake_normal_service_2(V)  
3.13.2.2.3.1.11  Note: the two pivot values A_SB01 and A_SB12 are part of the 
A_brake_normal_service model, i.e. they are train related input data for the speed and 
distance monitoring function.  
3.13.2.2.3.2  Brake reaction time and brake build up time  
3.13.2.2.3.2.1  The deceleration A_brake is not available immediately after the on -board commands 
the brake. There is a time lag between brake command and the start of the brake force 
build -up. There is also time needed to build up the full brake force.  
3.13.2.2.3.2.2  The model s for the brake build up time shall be given both as a ramp function and as 
a step function as explained in Figure 31.

3.13.2.2.3.2.3  In Figure 31, the following time intervals are defined:  
a) T_brake_react (t0…t1) is the interval between the command of the brake by the on -
board and the moment the brake force starts to build up.  
b) T_brake_increase (t1...t2) is the interval in which the brake force increases from the 
zero to the moment when 95% of fu ll brake effort  is reached.  
c) T_brake_build_up (t0...t3) is the equivalent brake build up time.

 3.13.2.2.3.2.4  The equivalent brake build up time (T_brake_build_up) is defined as 
T_brake_build_up = T_brake_react + 0.5*T_brake_increase.  
3.13.2.2.3.2.5  This model for T_brake_build_up shall  be used for the emergency brake 
(T_brake_emergency) and for the full service brake (T_brake_service).  
3.13.2.2.3.2.6  Note: The equivalent brake build up time is a safe approximation. In the beginning of 
the build -up time the ramp and step model s assume a deceleration  smaller than the real 
shape , in the later part this is compensated by a higher deceleration.  The approximation 
done with the 95% factor is compensated by the margin between the models and the 
real shape existing in the beginning of the build -up time.  
3.13.2.2.3.2.7  Intentionally deleted . 
3.13.2.2.3.2.8  It shall be possible to define individual values of T_brake_emergency_react, 
T_brake_emergency , T_brake_service_react  and T_brake_service for each combination 
of use of regenerative brake, eddy current brake, magnetic shoe brake and  Ep brake . 
3.13.2.2.3.2.9  Note: Individual values of T_brake_emergency and T_brake_service may be equal, 
thereby avoiding the influence of a specific brake. However, the choice to take into 
account or not the contribution of a specific brake for T_brake_emergency and 
T_brake_service is only rolling stock dependent, not an ETCS implementation issue.  
3.13.2.2.3.2.10  Note: In general, T_brake_emergency and T_brake_service are determined by the 
pneumatic brake therefore avoiding to take into account of the influence of the 
regenerative brake, eddy current brake or magnetic shoe brake. However, if the Electro -
pneumatic brake system is used, it is possible that T_brake_emergency and 
T_brake_service are determined by another special brake.  
3.13.2.2.4  Brake Position  
3.13.2.2.4.1  The brake positi on shall be set to one of the following three values:  
a) Passenger train in P  
b) Freight train in P  
c) Freight train in G  
3.13.2.2.4.2  Note: The brake position defines the behaviour of the brake for specific train types.  
3.13.2.2.5  Brake Percentage  
3.13.2.2.5.1  If the brake percentage is captured as T rain Data and the conversion model is 
applicable (see  3.13.3.2 ), they are used to derive A_brake _emergency (V), 
A_brake_service(V), T_brake_emergency  and T_brake_ service .

 3.13.2.2.6.3  When the brake percentage is captured as Train Data and the conversion model is 
applicable, A_brake_emergency(V), T_brake_emergency and A_brake_service(V) shall 
not be influenced by the status of a special brake. However, the conve rsion model offers 
the possibility that T_brake _service can be affected by the status of the regenerative 
brake, eddy current brake o r Ep brake (see A.3.9) . 
3.13.2.2.6.4  The on -board equipment shall be configured to define whether it is allowed to take 
into account the  contribution of a special/additional brake, which is independent from 
wheel/rail adhesion, for the selection of the maximum emergency brake deceleration 
under reduced adhesion conditions (see 3.13.6.2.1.6 ). 
3.13.2.2.6.5  Note: the choice to set to “allowed” the contribution of such special/additional brake 
in the selection of the maximum emergency braking effort, is rolling stock dependent.  
3.13.2.2.6.6  If it is allowed to ta ke into account the contribution of a special/additional brake, which 
is independent from wheel/rail adhesion, the speed and distance monitoring function 
shall take into account the status “active” or “not active” of the special/additional brake 
to select the appropriate National Value under reduced adhesion conditions (see 
3.13.2.3.7.7 ). 
3.13.2.2.7  Service brake  
3.13.2.2.7.1  The on -board shall be configured to define whethe r the service brake command is 
implemented or not, i.e. whether a service brake interface is implemented to command 
a full service brake effort.  
3.13.2.2.7.2  The on -board shall be configured to define whether the service brake feedback is 
implemented or not, i.e. wheth er it is able to acquire from the service brake interface the 
information that the service brake is currently  applied.  
3.13.2.2.7.3  If the service brake feedback is implemented and if not inhibited by National Value, 
the speed and distance monitoring function shall tak e into account either the main brake 
pipe pressure or the brake cylinder pressure to adjust in real time the expected brake 
build up time (see 3.13.9.3.3.4 and Appendix A .3.10).  
3.13.2.2.8  Traction cut -off interface  
3.13.2.2.8.1  The on -board shall be configured to define whether the traction cut -off command is

 3.13.2.2.9.1.2  For each defined individual speed dependent deceleration model of 
A_brake_emergency(V) (i.e. corresponding to each combination of use of regenerative 
brake, eddy current brake and magnetic shoe brake), one set of rolling stock correction 
factors Kdry_rs t(V, EBCL) and Kwet_rst(V) shall be defined in the on -board equipment.  
3.13.2.2.9.1.3  For a given confidence level on emergency brake safe deceleration (EBCL), the rolling 
stock correction factor Kdry_rst(V) shall be given as a step function of speed, with the 
same steps  as the ones of A_brake_emergency(V).  
3.13.2.2.9.1.4  The confidence level on emergency brake safe deceleration represents the probability 
of the following individual event: the rolling stock emergency brake subsystem of the train 
does ensure a deceleration at least equal  to A_brake_emergency(V) * Kdry_rst(V), when 
the emergency brake is commanded on dry rails.  
3.13.2.2.9.1.5  The rolling stock correction factor Kwet_rst(V) shall be given as a step function of 
speed, with the same steps as the ones of A_brake_emergency(V). It represents t he loss 
of deceleration with regards to emergency braking on dry rails, when the emergency 
brake is commanded on wet rails, according to wheel/rail adhesion reference conditions.

 3.13.3  Conversion Models  
3.13.3.1  Introduction  
3.13.3.1.1  For trains with variable composition (loco hauled trains), the brak e characteristics can 
vary together with the composition of the train. In this case, it is not convenient to pre -
program the brake parameters necessary to calculate the braking curves. The only 
practical way to obtain the correct values for the current tra in composition is to include 
them into the data entry process by the driver. However, it cannot be expected from the 
driver to know deceleration values and brake build up times. Conversion models are 
therefore defined to convert the parameters entered by t he driver (brake percentage and 
brake position) into the parameters of the corresponding brake model.  
3.13.3.1.2  Note: The process for defining the input parameters for the conversion model (brake 
percentage and brake position) is outside the scope of the ERTMS/ETCS specifications.  
3.13.3.2  Applicability of the conversion models  
3.13.3.2.1  The conversion models shall be used by the on -board equipment if the brake percentage 
is acquired as part of Train Data, and if the maximum train speed, the brake percentage 
and the train le ngth are all within the following validity limits of the conversion models:  
a) 0 ≤ V ≤ 200, where V is the maximum train speed in km/h  
b) 30 ≤ λ ≤ 250, where λ is the brake percentage in %  
c) 0 ≤ L ≤ Lmax , where L is the train length in m  and where Lmax = 900  m if the brake 
position is “Passenger train in P” or Lmax = 1500  m if the brake position is “Freight 
train in P” or “Freight train in G”  
3.13.3.2.1.1  Note: The overspeed above the maximum train speed which may occur due to the 
ceiling speed margins is taken into account in the definition of the conversion model.  
3.13.3.2.2  For trains not fitting into at least one of those validity limits, it is still possible to acquire 
the brake percentage as Train Data, but the conversion models are not applicable, which 
means that braking models (i. e. pre -programmed deceleration profiles and brake build 
up times) shall be used by the speed and distance monitoring function . 
3.13.3.3  Brake percentage conversion model  
3.13.3.3.1  Input parameters  
3.13.3.3.1.1  The input for the model shall be the brake percentage of the train as defined in 
3.13.2.2.5 . 
3.13.3.3.2  Calculation of the basic deceleration  
3.13.3.3.2.1  The basic deceleration A_basic(V) shall be given as a step function of the speed using 
the algorithm defined in Appendix A .3.7.

 gradient profile between the location of the fictive train front end and the location of the 
fictive train rear end (see Figure 35). 
3.13.4.3  Rotating mass  
3.13.4.3.1  The influence of gradients shall be compensated for the rotating mass of the train (see 
Figure 35). 
3.13.4.3.1.1  Note: Since the rotating mass works like a fl ywheel (rotating inertia), the effect of the 
gradient is reduced. Assume for instance a (theoretical) train without any rotating mass, 
not braking, on a downhill gradient from height 1 to height 2. All the energy added to the 
train when it goes from H1 to H2 is converted into linear forward motion. This can be 
observed as an acceleration due to the gradient. Now assume the same train with part 
of the weight rotating. If this train travels the same distance from H1 to H2, the same 
amount of energy is added t o the train. But now a part of that energy is converted into 
rotational motion and only the remaining part is converted into linear forward motion. The 
latter can be observed as an acceleration which is less than for the train without rotating 
mass.  
3.13.4.3.1.2  Note: For the influence of the rotating mass on the deceleration due to the brake, it is 
already taken into account in the values for the brake parameters.  
3.13.4.3.2  The following formulas shall be used:  
a) If M_rotating_nom is unknown:  
• Uphill: A_gradient = g * grad / (1000+ 10*M_rotating_max)  
• Downhill: A_gradient = g * grad / (1000+10*M_rotating_min)  
b) If M_rotating_nom is known:  
• Uphill: A_gradient = g * grad / (1000+10*M_rotating_nom)  
• Downhill: A_gradient = g * grad / (1000+10*M_rotating_nom)  
Legend:  
A_gradient = acceleration/ deceleration due to gradient  (downhill acceleration is given 
with a negative value)  
g = 9.8 1 m/s2 - acceleration of gravity  in m/s2 
grad = gradient values in ‰ (positive = uphill)  
M_rotating_nom = nominal rotating mass (part of train data) as a percentage of the 
total train weight  
M_rotating_max = maximum possible rotating mass (see A .3.1) as a percentage of the 
total train weight  
M_rotating_min = minimum possible rotating mass (see A .3.1) as a per centage of the 
total train weight

 3.13.5  Determination of locations with out special  brake contribu tion and with 
reduced adhesion conditions  
3.13.5.1  As long as  it uses a  track condition profile given by trackside, the on -board shall consider 
locations with out special  brake contribu tion over a distance going from the start location 
of the profile to the foot of the deceleration c urve ( EBD, SBD or GUI, see section s 
3.13.8.3 , 3.13.8.4  and 3.13.8.5 ). 
3.13.5.2  If the status of a special brake is “not active”, all locations shall be considered without 
the contribution of this special brake.  
3.13.5.2.1  Note: in such case, a track condition profile implying th e inhibition of this special brake 
will have no effect.  
3.13.5.3  From the adhesion profile given by trackside, the on -board shall consider locations with 
reduced adhesion conditions over a distance going from the start location of the profile 
to the location derive d by adding the train length to the end location of the profile.  
3.13.5.4  When slippery rail is selected by the driver, all locations shall be considered with reduced 
adhesion conditions.  
3.13.5.5  The speed and distance monitoring shall use, as resulting reduced adhesion conditions, 
the most restrictive value of the adhesion conditions selected by the driver and the 
adhesion conditions calculated from the trackside profile.

calculation.  
3.13.6.3.2.2  No track related characteristics are to be considered for the expected brake build up

3.13.7  Determination of Most Restrictive Speed Profile (MRSP)  
3.13.7.1  The Most Restrictive Speed Profile (MRSP) is a description of the most restrictive speed 
restrictions the train must  obey on a given piece of track.  
3.13.7.2  The Most Restrictive Speed Profile shall be deriv ed from elements corresponding to all 
speed restrictions ( see 3.13.2.2.13  & 3.13.2.3.2 ), some el ements being compensated by 
the train length if requested by trackside (see 3.11.3.1.3  for SSP, 3.11.4.6  for ASP and 
3.11.5.3  for TSR) . To do so, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board shall continuousl y compute the 
MRSP current speed (V_MRSP), which is the lowest speed of the MRSP elements 
encountered between the min safe front end and the max safe front end of the train.

equipment, since the locations of its speed increases/decreases depend on the size of 
the train position confidence interval at a given time/location.  
3.13.8  Determination of targets and brake deceleration curves  
3.13.8.1  Introduction  
3.13.8.1.1  A target is defined by a target location and a target speed, to which the train m ust 
decelerate before reaching the target location.  
3.13.8.1.2  For that purpose, the on -board equipment shall use brake deceleration curves related to 
the supervised targets, from the deceleration values as specified in sections 3.13.6.2.1 , 
3.13.6.3.1 and 3.13.6.3.2.5 .

 3.13.8.1.3  These deceleration values being speed and distance dependent, a brake deceleration 
curve shall be calculated piecewise, i.e. it shall be composed of interconnected arcs of 
parabola, each one being based on one of the speed/distance dependent deceleration 
values  (see Figure 38). 
3.13.8.2  Determination of the supervised targets  
3.13.8.2.1  The on-board shall continuously supervise a list of targets, which may include the 
following types of target:  
a) the start locations of the MRSP elements whose speed is lower than V_MRSP and  
which are in advance of the max safe front end of the train  
b) the Limit of  Authority (LOA)  
c) the End of Authority (EOA) and the Supervised Location (SvL)  
d) the location deduced from the maximum permitted distance to run in Staff 
Responsible, with a target speed zero  
3.13.8.2.1.1  Note: depending on the information received from trackside and the position of the 
train, the list of supervised targets may be empty.  
3.13.8.2.2  The list of supervised targets shall be re -evaluated when any of the elements it is built of 
is changed (e.g. new MA and/or track description accepted on -board, update of stored 
informatio n in specific situations (see sections A.3.4 and 4.10)).  
3.13.8.2.3  A target corresponding to a n MRSP element shall be removed from the list of supervised 
targets when the max safe front end of the train has passed the target location.  
3.13.8.3  Emergency Brake Deceleration cu rves (EBD)  
3.13.8.3.1  If a target belongs to the MRSP or is an LOA, the on -board shall calculate an EBD curve 
based on the safe deceleration A_safe(V,d), that crosses the ceiling speed EBI 
supervision limit (see 3.13.9.2 ) at the target location , and that extends up to the location 
where the target speed is reached (EBD foot) .

3.13.8.5.1  The purpose of the guidance curve (GUI) is to provide a comfortable way of braking for 
the driver, to avoid excessive wear of the brakes and to save traction energy.  
3.13.8.5.2  If the National Value does not inhibit them, the on -board shall calculate a guidance curve 
(GUI) for each supervised target, based on the normal service brake deceleration 
A_normal_service(V,d). The foot of a GUI curve (i.e. the location where the GUI speed 
is equal to the target speed) shall be:  
a) the target location, in case of EOA/SvL  
b) the location  defined in 3.13.9.3.5.9 , for others targets  
3.13.9  Supervision limits  
3.13.9.1  Overview  
3.13.9.1.1  In this chapter the following supervision limits are defined:  
• Emergency bra ke intervention (EBI)  
• Service brake intervention (SBI)  
• Warning (W)  
• Permitted speed (P)  
• Indication (I)  
• Release speed monitoring start location  
3.13.9.1.2  The purpose of the emergency brake intervention supervision limit is to assure that the 
train will remain within t he various limits (in distance/speed) imposed by the trackside.

 3.13.9.1.3  The purpose of all other supervision limits is to assist the driver in preventing an

3.13.9.2  Ceiling s upervision limits  
3.13.9.2.1  The ceiling supervision limits are derived from the MRSP elements, where the speed is 
constant (refer to 3.13.7 ) or from the LOA.  
3.13.9.2.2  From an MRSP element or from the LOA, the Permitted speed, Warning, Service brake

curves.  
3.13.9.3.1.2  From an EBD curve, the Emergency brake intervention (EBI), Service brake 
intervention  (SBI2), Warning (W), Permitted speed (P) and Indication (I) supervision 
limits, valid for the estimated speed, are defined as follows(see Figure 45):

3.13.9.3.1.4  No specific supervision limit is calculated from the GUI curve: it is only used to adjust 
the Permitted speed (P) supervision limit, which is obtained either from the EBD or the 
SBD curve.  
3.13.9.3.2  EBI supervision limit  
3.13.9.3.2.1  If not inhibited by N ational Value, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall  
compensate the inaccuracy of the speed measurement by taking into account the speed 
under reading amount (V_ura)  at the moment when the calculation is made : V_delta0 = 
V_ura  (see Figure 45). 
3.13.9.3.2.2  The time elapsed between the Emergency brake intervention and the full application 
of the braking effort is reached (EBD) shall be split into two parts:  
a) Time during which the traction effort is still present: T_traction  
b) Remaining time during which the traction effort is not present: T_berem  
3.13.9.3.2.3  The traction time (T_Traction) shall be defined as follows:  
a) when the traction cut -off is implemented:  
T_traction = MAX((T_ traction_cut_off - (T_warning + T_bs2)) ; 0).  
b) when the traction cut -off is not implemented: T_traction = T_traction_cut_off  
3.13.9.3.2.4  Note: When the traction cut -off is implemented, the traction cut -off command is 
triggered when passing the warning limit. The term ( T_warning + T_bs2) in the equation 
above takes this into account, assuming that the warning limit is derived from the EBD.  
3.13.9.3.2.5  T_bs2 and T_warning are defined in sections 3.13.9.3.3  and 3.13.9.3.4 . 
3.13.9.3.2.6  The remaining time with no traction (T_berem) shall be equal to MA X(T_be _reduced  
- T_traction ; 0).

3.13.9.3.2.8  During T_traction, the estimated acceleration (A_est1) shall be the one  measured at

3.13.9.3.2.10  The compensated speed and the distance travelled during the time elapsed between 
the Emergenc y brake intervention and the full application of the braking effort is reached

determine the foot of the GUI curve (only i f it is enabled) in case of target different from 
EOA/SvL, the location of the Permitted speed supervision limit, valid for the target speed, 
shall be calculated from the EBD, taking into account the following assumptions:  
a) the estimated acceleration shall be set to “zero”  
b) if not inhibited by National Value, the compensation of the inaccuracy of the speed 
measurement shall be set to a value calculated from the target speed, as defined in 
SUBSET -041 § 5.3.1.2: V_ delta0 t = f 41(V_target)  
c) the safe brake build up  time shall be considered to be fully reduced as per A.3.12

d) if the service brake command is available for use and the service brake feedback is 
not available for use, the expected brake build up time sha ll be considered to be fully 
reduced as per A.3.12 algorithm, i.e. it shall be set to 𝑇𝑏𝑠_𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑐𝑡 
e) the above -mentioned location of the Permitted speed supervision limit shall not be 
beyond the target location  
3.13.9.3.5.10  To do so, the same formulas defined above with V_est and V_ delta0  shall be applied,

defined in section 3.13.9.3.3  
3.13.9.3.5.10.1  Justification: the  two first  assumptions are intended to avoid fluctuations of the 
target distance displayed to the driver. Moreover the foot of the GUI curve may influence 
the p erturb ation location, which must be full y predictable for trackside engineering 
reasons.

 The third and fourth assumptions are intended to consider the nominal operation, in 
which the train speed follows the permitted speed, leading to the reduction of the needed 
brake build up times to the minim um before the target location is reached.  
The fifth assumption is to ensure that the permitted speed displayed to the driver, 
considering the brake build up times reduction, is not higher than the target speed at the 
target location.  
3.13.9.3.5.11  In case a non protecte d LX start location is supervised as both temporary  EOA and 
SvL and the stopping in rear of LX is not required, the location of the most restrictive 
Permitted speed supervision limit, valid for the LX speed shall be used in order to 
determine the location where the supervision of the LX start location is substituted by the 
supervision of the LX speed (see section 5.16.3).

 3.13.9.3.6.2  If the service brake feedback interface is not available for use, then  T_indication shall 
be calculated as follows:  
𝑇𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛=𝑚𝑎𝑥{(0.8⋅𝑇𝑏𝑠_𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑒𝑑),5𝑠}+𝑇𝑑𝑟𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑟 
3.13.9.3.6.3  Note: The reduction of T_indication by a factor is intended to improve performance 
and the feasibility of this reduction is based on experience with real implementations. To 
avoid very low values when T_bs _reduced  is small, a minimum is defined for 
T_indication, giving the driver always enough time to operate the brake.  
3.13.9.3.6.4  If the service brake feedback interface is available for use then T_indication shall be 
equal to  5s + T_driver . 
3.13.9.3.6.5  If available for use, the service brake  feedback shall not have any effect on T_bs1 
and T_bs2 when calculating the Indication supervision limit: T_bs1 and T_bs2 shall be 
set to T_bs in the formulas in 3.13.9.3.2 and 3.13.9.3.3.  
3.13.9.3.6.6  Note 1: This avoids that service brake feedback, while braking to o ne target which 
causes the full locking of T_bs1 and T_bs2 for all the targets, affects the Indication 
supervision limit for another target(s). Otherwise, the indication to the driver could come 
too late. It also avoids its influence on the acceptance crit eria of request to shorten MA.  
3.13.9.3.6.7  Note 2: If the service brake feedback is not available for use, T_bs1 and T_bs2 are 
set either to T_bs or to zero, depending on the availability of the service brake command 
(see 3.13.9.3.3.3 and 3.13.9.3.3.5).  
3.13.9.4  Release speed supervision limits  
3.13.9.4.1  The release speed is a special ceiling speed limit, applicable in the vicinity of the EOA. 
The EBI supervision limit is equal to the release speed. There is no SBI, W, P, I 
supervision limit associated to the release speed.  
3.13.9.4.2  Note: The rel ease speed may be necessary for two reasons. One is that a train has to 
be able to approach the EOA where the permitted speed reaches zero and might be too 
restrictive to permit acceptable driving due to inaccuracy of the measured distance. The 
other reaso n is that in a level 1 application the train has to be able to overpass the balise 
when the signal clears. For these two reasons a (low) release speed may be given from 
trackside or may be calculated on board, based on the distance from the E OA to the 
Supe rvised Location.  
3.13.9.4.3  With each MA, it shall be possible for the trackside to:  
a) Give the value of the release speed directly to the on -board, OR  
b) Instruct the on -board to calculate the release speed, OR  
c) Instruct the on -board to use the national value.  
3.13.9.4.4  In case the  MA does not identify the variant to be used or in case of LOA, no release 
speed shall be supervised.

 3.13.9.4.5  Note: When the release speed is given as a fixed value from trackside, the ERTMS/ETCS 
system cannot be responsible for stopping the train in rear of the S upervised Location. 
In this case, it is the full responsibility of the infrastructure manager to set the appropriate 
release speed with regard to the risk of passing the Supervised Location.  
3.13.9.4.6  The start location of the release speed monitoring (i.e. where th e EBI supervision limit 
related to EBD is replaced with an EBI supervision limit equal to the release speed value) 
shall be the location of the most restrictive SB I supervision limit  among the SBI1 related

3.13.9.4.8.2.1  Note: The above formulas  are intended to prevent the calculated release speed from 
fluctuating, according to the distance, speed and acceleration measurements. It allows 
calculating the release speed onl y once, for a given on-board  reference location, unless  
• the train position  confidence interval exceeds a predicted one, which is based 
on the assumption that the whole distance between the current on -board 
reference location and the EOA would be travelled with SUBSET -041 odometer 
performance values  and without any update of the on -board reference location, 
or 
• the speed under reading amount (V_ura) exceeds the SUBSET -041 
performance value  
Whenever the on-board reference location is updated (e.g. new LRBG), t he release 
speed will however be recalculated and will increase with a step. This behaviour is 
acceptable from an operational point of view.  
3.13.9.4.8.2.2  Note: The method chosen (e.g. iterative algorithm) to compute the release speed is 
an implementation issue.  
3.13.9.4.9  If the release speed ( Figure 52 box 1 gives an example when it is calculated on -board) 
exceeds any MRSP element anywhere in the area ( Figure 52 box 2) delimited on one 
side by the location situated at a distance equal to the train position confidence interval 
vs. the SOLR  in rear of the presumed start loca tion of the Release speed monitoring and 
on the other side by the trip location related to the E OA (see d_tripEOA in 3.13.9.4.8.2) , 
the on -board shall use as a fixed release speed ( Figure 52 box 4) the most restrictive 
MRSP element (Figure 52 box 3) within this  (these) area(s), and shall re -evaluate the 
start location of the Release speed monitoring accordingly .

3.13.10  Speed and distance monitoring commands  
3.13.10.1  Introduction  
3.13.10.1.1  By comparing the train speed and position  to the various supervision limits defined in the 
previous section, the on -board equipment generates braking commands, traction cut -off 
commands and relevant information  to the driver.  The information displayed to the driver 
is selected according to the fo llowing supervision statuses of the speed and distance 
monitoring function: Normal status, Indication status, Overspeed status, Warning status 
and Intervention status.  
3.13.10.1.2  The following types of speed and distance monitoring are defined:  
• Ceiling speed monitori ng (CSM)  
• Target speed monitoring  (TSM)  
• Release speed monitoring (RSM)

3.13.10.1.3  Ceiling speed monitoring is the speed supervision in the area where the train can run 
without the need to brake to a target.  
3.13.10.1.4  Target speed monitoring is the speed and distance supervision in the area where the 
specific information related to a target is displayed to the driver and within which the train 
brakes to a target.  
3.13.10.1.5  Release speed monitoring is the speed and distance supervision in the area close to the 
EOA where the train is allowed to run with release speed to approach the EOA.  
3.13.10.2  General requirements  
3.13.10.2.1  The train speed indicated to the driver shall be identical to the speed u sed for the speed 
monitoring . This shall be the estimated speed . 
3.13.10.2.2  Once a Train Interface command (traction cut -off, service brake or emergency brake) is 
triggered, the on -board shall apply it until its corresponding revocation condition is met.  
3.13.10.2.3  If there is no on -board interface with the service brake or if the use of the service brake 
command is not allowed by a National Value (only in Target speed monitoring), whenever 
a service brake command is specified, the emergency brake command shall be triggered 
instead. 
3.13.10.2.4  The emergency brake command, which is triggered instead of the service brake 
command when an SBI supervision limit is exceeded, shall be revoked according to the 
requirements specified for the revocation of service brake command, unless the 
emergency brake command has been also triggered due to an EBI supervision limit. In 
such case, the condition for revoking the emergency brake command due to EBI 
supervision limit shall prevail.

3.13.10.2.6  In level 2: Train trip shall be initiated if : 
a) the on -board equipment detects that the minimum safe front end has passed the 
EOA/LOA location, OR  
b) while being in release speed monitoring, the on -board equipment receives a balise

to be:  
• in rear of the EOA by a distance shorter than the distance between the active 
Eurobalise antenna and the front end of the train, OR 
• at the EOA, OR

 on-board shall immediately set the supervision status to the relevant value, applying a 
transition from the Normal status according to Table 7. 
3.13.10.3.6  The Indication status is not used in ceiling speed monitoring. However, in case the ceiling 
speed monitoring is entered and the supervision status was previously set to Indication, 
the on -board equipment shall immediately execute one of the transitions fro m the 
Indication status, as described in Table 7. 
3.13.10.3.7  In ceiling speed monitoring, only the ceiling supervision limits (described in section 
3.13.9.2 ) are used to determine the commands to the Train Interface and the supervision 
statuses displayed to the driver. However the braking to target supervis ion limits and the 
release speed supervision limits (described in sections 3.13.9.3  and 3.13.9.3.6.5 ) are 
also used to determine the locations where the transition to target speed monitoring and 
to release speed monitoring occur respectively . 
3.13.10.3.8  The on -board equipment shall display to the driver the first Indication location that will be 
reached either by the max safe or by the estimated train front end. To that effect, the on -

With [𝑑𝑆𝐵𝐼2(𝑉𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑒)]𝑀𝑅𝐸𝐵𝐷𝑇  as defined in 3.13.9.4.7  
And with Target_1, ..., Target_m being EBD based targets whose speed value is below 
V_MRSP and is below the estimated speed, excluding the SvL and any other targets between 
the Trip location  related to the EOA and the SvL

equipment shall not display any first Indication location information.

 (target speed and distance to target) related to one target at a time: the Most Relevant 
Displayed Target (MRDT). The MRDT shall be selected amongst the supervised targets 
as the one wh ich determines the remaining distance to the first  Indication location  (as 
specified in 3.13.10.3.8 and 3.13.10.3.8.1). The indicated distance to the target shall be 
computed in the same way as for target speed monitoring, i.e. clauses 3.13.10.4.7, 
3.13.10.4.8 and 3.13.10.4.8.1 shall apply.  
3.13.10.3.9.1  Exception: In case the list of supervised targets  is empty or in case of LOA with no 
EBD based target whose speed value is below V_MRSP and with no EBD based target 
whose speed value is below the estimated speed, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 
equipment shall not display any target information.  
3.13.10.3.10  If A_MAXREDADH ( see 3.13.6.2.1.6) requests a time to Indication as supplementary 
DMI information, the on -board equipment shall compute the Time to Indication (TTI) as 
the time to travel at the estimated speed the remaining distance to the first Indication 
location (as spe cified in 3.13.10.3.8 and 3.13.10.3.8.1). The on -board equipment shall 
inform the driver as long as this time is shorter than a fixed value (refer to A.3.1).  
3.13.10.3.10.1  Exception: In case the list of supervised targets is empty or in case of LOA with no 
EBD based tar get whose speed value is below V_MRSP and with no EBD based target 
whose speed value is below the estimated speed, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 
equipment shall not compute any time to Indication.  
3.13.10.4  Requirements for Target speed monitoring  
3.13.10.4.1  In target speed monitori ng, both the ceiling supervision limits and the braking to target 
supervision limits, described in sections 3.13.9.2  and 3.13.9.3 , are used to determine the 
commands to the Train Interface and the supervision statuses displayed to the driver.  
3.13.10.4.2  The on -board equipment sha ll display to the driver the target information (target speed 
and distance to target) related to one target at a time: the Most Re levant  Displayed 
Target (MRDT). The MRDT shall be selected amongst the supervised targets whose 
Indication supervision limit i s exceeded (i.e. a condition to trigger a supervision status 
with respect to these targets is met, see table 8 and table 9) and shall be determined 
according to the following steps:  
• Step 0: MRDT 0 = the target of which the braking to target Permitted speed supervision 
limit (refer to section 3.13.9.3.5 ), calculated for the current position of the train, is the 
lowest one amongst the concerned targets:

• Step 1: the on -board equipment shall check whether the MRDT obtained from the 
previous step (MRDT 0) masks any other target(s) remaining in the list of concerned 
targets, whose target speed is lower than MRDT 0. A target is maske d by MRDT 0 if its 
Indication supervision limit is located in rear of the location of the MRDT 0 Permitted 
speed supervision limit, both at the target speed of MRDT 0. It shall be identified using 
one of the following formulas, where both the Indication super vision limit and the 
Permitted speed supervision limit are calculated using the same formulas defined 
above and by substituting V_est with V_target_MRDT 0:

If at least one target is masked by MRDT 0, then the MRDT obtained from this step 
(MRDT 1) shall be the masked target with its Indication supervision limit the furthest  in 
rear of the location of the MRDT 0 Permitted speed supervision limit and the on -board 
equipment shall go to the next step.  
If none of the remaining targets from the list of concerned targets is masked by MRDT 0 
or if there is no other remaining target to check in the list of concerned targets, then 
the MRDT shall be the target obtained from the previous step (i.e. MRDT 0). 
... 
• Step n: the on -board shall apply step n -1, substituting MRDT n-2 with MRDT n-1 and 
checking the list of concerned targets excluding the targets which have been 
preselected as MRDT in all the previous steps (i.e. from MRDT 0 to MRDT n-1 inclusive).  
3.13.10.4.2.1  Note 1: the a bove process for the determination of the MRDT ensures that when 
several targets are close to each other it is avoided that a target is displayed after its 
Indication supervision limit has been reached . 
3.13.10.4.2.2  Note 2: when entering target speed monitoring, there is by definition at least one target 
that satisfies the conditions to be selected as MRDT. Afterwards (e.g. due to train 
braking) it is possible that no target satisfies any more the conditions to be selected as 
MRDT, which however only means that the targ et previously selected remains the MRDT 
(see clause 3.13.10.4.5).  
3.13.10.4.2.3  Note 3: if MRDT n-1 is a target at zero speed (e.g. EOA or SvL) , then it is always 
selected as MRDT, i.e. no other target can be selected as MRDT as per step n .

3.13.10.4.5  Once a  target is the MRDT, it shall remain the MRDT until it is removed from the list of 
supervised targets or until it is replaced as MRDT with another target that has a target 
speed lower than or equal to the current MRDT and which is selected according to clause 
3.13.10.4.2. The driver shall be informed upon any change of MRDT . 
3.13.10.4.6  If the MRDT is either the EOA or the SvL, the on -board equipment shall display the 
release speed, if given by the trackside or calculated on -board.  
3.13.10.4.7  If the MRDT is neithe r the EOA nor the SvL, the indicated distance to the target shall be

3.13.10.4.8.1  As long as the displayed values are locked due to SB feedback (see Appendix A .3.10

equipment shall ensure that the displayed Permitted speed, the displayed SBI  speed (if 
any) and the distance to target (in case of service brake feedback) never increase (e.g. 
due to the reduction of T_bs1 and T_bs2 or e.g. due to relocation). In other terms if a 
concerned displayed value (VP_DMI, VSBI_DMI or target distance) calc ulated as above 
has a higher value than the previously displayed value, then the previous value shall 
remain displayed until a further calculated value is lower than the displayed one.  
3.13.10.4.9  The on -board shall consider the service brake command as available for use unless:  
a) The service brake command is not implemented, OR  
b) The national value inhibits its use.

 3.13.10.4.12  Note: Figure 55 shows the parts of the ceiling speed and braking to target supervision 
limits, which are used in target speed monitoring to trigger the brake commands and the 
transitions between supervision statuses. It does not show what is displayed to the driver: 
in particular, the braking to target Permitted supervision limit is displayed (even if not 
supervised) for values lower than the release speed.  
3.13.10.4.13  In case of target EOA/SvL with a release speed higher than or equal to V_MRSP or 
without any supervised release spee d, the Table 9 and Table 11 shall be applied,  by 
substituting V_release with the value 0.  
3.13.10.4.13.1  In case the target is the location at the end of the maximum permitted distance to run

3.13.10.4.14  A TI command shall be triggered if a corresponding triggering condition is met for at

 3.13.10.4.16  When the speed and distance monitoring function becomes active and the target 
speed monitoring is the first one entered, the triggering condition t 3 defined in Table 8 or 
Table 9 shall be checked for each target in order to determine whether the Indicati on 
status applies. If it is not the case, the on -board shall immediately set the supervision 
status to the relevant value, applying a transition from the Indication  status according to 
clause 3.13.10.4.15 . 
3.13.10.4.17  The Normal status is not used in target speed moni toring. However, in case the target 
speed monitoring is entered and the supervision status was previously set to Normal, the 
on-board equipment shall immediately execute one of the transitions from the Normal 
status, as specified in clause 3.13.10.4.15.  
3.13.10.4.18  Note: Depending upon train speed/position it is possible that for some target(s) none 
of the triggering conditions specified in table 8 and 9 is met. However the conditions to 
enter the target speed monitoring are such (see condition [1] in table 16) that th e clauses 
3.13.10.4.16 and 3.13.10.4.17 always allow determining a supervision status.  
3.13.10.5  Requirements for release speed monitoring  
3.13.10.5.1  The on -board equipment shall display the Release speed.  
3.13.10.5.2  The on -board equipment shall display the target distance according to t he following 
formula:  
[target distance]𝐷𝑀𝐼= 𝑚𝑎𝑥{𝑚𝑖𝑛{(𝑑𝐸𝑂𝐴−𝑑𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑓𝑟𝑜𝑛𝑡),(𝑑𝑆𝑣𝐿−𝑑𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑠𝑎𝑓𝑒𝑓𝑟𝑜𝑛𝑡 )},0} 
3.13.10.5.3  The braking to target Permitted speed supervision limit related to either the EOA or the 
SvL shall also be displayed  according to the following formula:  
[𝑉𝑃]𝐷𝑀𝐼=min{[𝑉𝑃(𝑑𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑓𝑟𝑜𝑛𝑡)]
𝐸𝑂𝐴,[𝑉𝑃(𝑑𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑠𝑎𝑓𝑒𝑓𝑟𝑜𝑛𝑡 )]

3.13.10.5.3.1  The clause 3.13.10.4.8.1 shall also apply by analogy for the display of the target 
distance a nd the braking to target Permitted speed supervision limit related to the 
EOA/SvL.  
3.13.10.5.4  The on -board equipment shall compare the estimated speed with the release speed and

3.13.10.6.2  If a transition of speed and distance monitoring occurs while a brake command is already 
applied, the concerned command shall be maintained until the revocation condition, if 
specified for the newly entered speed and distance monitoring, is fulfilled.  
3.13.10.6.2.1  Note: This means that when the service bra ke is commanded in ceiling speed 
monitoring while it is not available in target speed monitoring, the service brake remains 
commanded when the on -board switches to target speed monitoring and is only revoked 
when the Permitted speed supervision limit is no  longer exceeded.  
3.13.10.6.3  If a transition from target speed monitoring to ceiling speed or release speed monitoring 
occurs while a traction cut -off command is already applied, the traction cut -off command 
shall be immediately revoked.  
3.13.10.6.4  If a transition from target s peed monitoring to release speed monitoring occurs while a 
service brake command is already applied, the service brake command shall be 
immediately revoked.  
3.13.10.6.5  On executing a transition between types of speed and distance monitoring, the 
supervision status sh all be determined according to the requirements specified for the 
newly entered speed and distance monitoring.  
3.13.11  Perturbation location  
3.13.11.1  The purpose of the perturbation location is to trigger the MA request to the RBC in order 
to renew the Movement Authority i n due time before the train would have to brake to an 
EOA/SvL or LOA target.  
3.13.11.2  For the SvL, the on -board shall calculate the perturbation location applying the clauses 
3.13.11.3, 3.13.11.4, 3.13.11.5 and 3.13.11.6 . 
3.13.11.3  Starting from the first element of the MRSP  (i.e. from the start location of the on -board 
stored track description), the on -board shall calculate the location of the Indication 
supervision limit, valid for the speed of the MRSP element, taking into account the 
following assumptions:  
a) the estimated acceleration shall be set to “zero”

c) If available for use, the service brake feedback shall not have any effect: T_bs1ind 
and T_bs2ind shall be set to T_bs if the service brake command is available for use, 
otherwise they shall be set to “zero”. T_tractionind and T_berem ind shall be defined 
as in 3.13.9.3.2 for T_traction and T_berem by substituting T_bs2 with T_bs2ind  and 
T_be_reduced with T_be  as defined in 3.13.6.2.2.3

3.13.11.7.1  For the LOA, the on -board shall calculate its perturbation location in the same way as for 
the SvL, except that:  
a) the elements of the MRSP whose speed is lower than the LOA speed shall be 
skipped,  
b) the clause 3.13.11.6 shall apply only if none of the two referred consecutive MRSP 
elements is skipped according to a)  
3.13.11.7.1.1  In case no perturbation location can be found applying 3.13.11.7.1 (e.g. the LOA 
speed is higher tha n the speed of all elements of the MRSP), the perturbation location 
shall be set at the LOA location.  
3.13.11.7.1.2  In case the perturbation location found applying 3.13.11.7.1 is in advance of the LOA, 
the perturbation location shall be set at the LOA location.

with its estimated front end for the perturbation location calculated from the EOA or with 
its max safe front end for the perturbation location calculated from the SvL or the L OA,

 3.14 Brake Command Handling and Protection against Undesirable 
Train Movement  
3.14.1  Brake Command Handling  
3.14.1.1  Note: Whenever the type of brake used is not specified explicitly in the text, it shall be 
interpreted as not being important for technical interoperability and being a property of  
the specific implementation.  
3.14.1.2  In case only the application of (the non -vital) service brake has been commanded a nd 
the service brake fails to be applied, the emergency brake command shall be given.  
3.14.1.3  If the emergency brake command was triggered due to a trip condition (see chapter 4) 
the emergency brake command shall be released at standstill and after driver 
acknowle dgement of the trip condition.  
3.14.1.4  For handling of brake commands resulting from the speed and distance monitoring, refer 
to section 3.13.10 . 
3.14.1.5  If the brake command was triggered due to roll away protection, unauthorised direction  
movement protection , standstill  supervision , or detection of a train movement while 
modifying/revalidating train data or while entering SR speed/distance limits,  the brake 
command shall be released at standstill and after driver acknowledgement.  
3.14.1.6  If the brake command was triggered due t o linking error, balise group message 
inconsistency or RAMS related supervision error, the brake command shall be released 
at standstill.  
3.14.1.7  If the brake command was triggered due to supervision of the safe radio connection 
(T_NVCONTACT) the brake command sha ll be released at standstill or if a new message 
has been received from the RBC.  
3.14.1.7.1  If the brake command was triggered due to an overpassed  reversing distance related to 
a reversing area  or due to any further movement in the direction opposite to the train 
orientation while the reversing distance is still overpassed , the brake command shall be 
released if the reversing distance becomes  extended so that the reversing distance is no 
longer overpassed , or at standstill after driver acknowledgement.  
3.14.1.7.2  If the brake c ommand was triggered due to change of Train Data while running (see 
section 5.17 procedure "Changing Train Data from sources different from the driver”), 
the brake command shall be released at standstill and after driver acknowledge ment . 
3.14.1.7.3  If the brake comma nd was triggered due to the driver not having acknowledged a mode 
or level change ordered from trackside (see sections 5.7, 5.9, 5.10 and 5.19), the brake 
command shall be released after the driver has acknowledged the mode or level 
transition .

 3.14.1.7.4  If the brak e command was triggered due to an overpass ed distance allowed for reverse 
movement  in Post Trip mode  or due to any further movement in the direction opposite to 
the train orientation while the distance allowed for reverse  movement  in Post Trip mode 
is still overpassed , the brake command shall be released at standstill and after driver 
acknowledgement.  
3.14.1.7.5  If the brake command was triggered due to the driver not having acknowledged a text 
message, the brake command shall be released after the driver has acknowledged the 
text message.  
3.14.1.7.6  If the brake command was triggered due to the safe consist length information having 
become unavailable, the brake command shall be released at standstill.  
3.14.1.7.7  For handling of brake commands resulting from the STM control function, refer to 
SUBSET -035. 
3.14.1.8  A brake command reason that pertains to one of the above clauses 3.14.1.3  to 3.14.1.7. 7 
shall be considered as applicable from the time the brake command is triggered to the 
time the release condition specified in the concerned above clause is fulfilled or to the 
time it is revoked due to a mode change . 
3.14.1.9  Whenever an acknowledgem ent is requested together with standstill for the release 
condition of a brake command, it shall be requested to the driver only when the train 
reaches standstill.  
3.14.1.10  In case more than one reason to command the brake is applicable at the same time, the 
brake command shall be released only when the release conditions specified for each of 
the above clauses 3.14.1.3 to 3.14.1.7. 7 including the concerned reasons have been 
fulfilled. In particular, if several brake command reasons applicable at the same time are 
included in several clauses where a driver acknowledgement is required, there shall be 
as many individual driver acknowledgements required as concerned clauses.  
3.14.1.10.1  In some of the above clauses 3.14.1.3 to 3.14.1.7. 7, brake reasons are grouped: in case 
several brake command reasons are applicable at the same time and they are all 
pertaining to the same clause, only one driver acknowledgement shall be required in 
relation to these brake reasons.  
3.14.1.11  In case a change of mode occurs while a brake command due to one or more reasons 
is still ongoing, see section 4.12 specifying for every individual brake command reason 
whether it shall be revoked or it shall remain applicable.  
3.14.1.11.1  Upon a mode change, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall maintain the brake 
command if at lea st one individual brake command reason remains applicable, until the 
corresponding release conditions have been all fulfilled.  
3.14.1.11.2  If an individual brake command reason is revoked on a mode change, the release 
conditions specified in the clause including this brake reason shall not apply anymore, 
unless another brake reason included in the same clause remains applicable further to 
this mode change.

 3.14.2  Roll Away Protection  
3.14.2.1  Note: This protection is only applicable if the required information can be obtained from 
the direction controller.  
3.14.2.2  The Roll Away Protection (RAP) shall prevent the train from moving in a direction, which 
conflicts with the current position of the direction controller in the active desk.  
3.14.2.3  If the controller is in neutral position, the RAP shall prev ent forward and reverse 
movements of the train.  
3.14.2.4  As soon as  a movement conflicting with the position of the direction controller is detected, 
the ERTMS/ETCS on -board shall start supervising (see section 3.6.7) whether the train 
travels away, from the locati on when the conflicting movement was detected, over a 
distance longer than  the national value for the allowed roll away distance . In case this 
roll away distance is exceeded,  the brake  command  shall be triggered.  
3.14.2.5  Refer to section 3.14.1 . 
3.14.2.6  An indication shall be given to the driver showing when the RAP is commanding the 
brakes.  
3.14.2.7  After revocation of the brake command , the RAP shall be re -initialised , i.e. the clause 
3.14.2.4 shall be applied again . 
3.14.3  Unauthorised Direction  Movement Protection  
3.14.3.1  The Unauthorised Direction  Movement Protection ( UDMP) shall prevent the train from 
moving in the opposite direction to the permitted one. The permitted movement directi on 
of a train shall be the one of the currently valid MA, if available on -board. See chapter 4 
concerning permitted direction for special cases.  
3.14.3.2  As soon as  a movement opposite to the authorised direction is detected, the 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board shall start supervising (see section 3.6.7) whether the train 
travels away, from the location when the opposite movement was detected, over a 
distance longer than  a distance s pecified by the national value.  In case this distance is 
exceeded, the brake command sh all be triggered.  
3.14.3.3  Refer to section 3.14.1 . 
3.14.3.4  An indication shall be given to the driver showing when the UDMP is commanding the 
brakes.  
3.14.3.5  After revocat ion of the brake command , the UDMP shall be reinitialised , i.e. the clause 
3.14.3.2 shall be applied again . 
3.14.3.6  Information received from balises during movement opposite to the authorised direction 
shall be ignored .

3.15 Special functions  
3.15.1  RBC/RBC Handover  
3.15.1.1  Introduction  
3.15.1.1.1  The RBC/RBC Handover principles are such that trains are able to pass from one RBC 
area to another automatically (without driver action).  
3.15.1.1.2  This is also granted when, due to a failure in the GSM -R on-board radio commun ication 
system,  the on -board is no longer able to manage two communication sessions 
established through GSM -R at once , while the communication session with the Handing 
Over RBC has been established through GSM -R and the communication session with 
the Accep ting RBC can only be established through GSM -R. Thereby, the behaviour of 
the RBCs is independent from such on -board degraded situation . 
3.15.1.1.3  However, such an RBC/RBC handover performed by a train with only one 
communication session established through GSM -R at once  may result in performance 
penalties since it will not be able to “prepare” (session establishment, version 
determination, …) the expected supervision by the Accepting RBC until the on -board 
disconnects from the Handing Over RBC.  
3.15.1.1.4  Intentionally  deleted . 
3.15.1.1.5  For successive RBC/RBC handovers, it shall be possible for an RBC to act as the 
Accepting and as the Handing Over RBC for the same engine at different RBC/RBC 
border locations simultaneously.  
3.15.1.1.5.1  Note: Successive RBC/RBC handover means that the track side initiates another 
handover procedure while an ongoing handover has not finished. However, from the 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board point of view, there is only one handover at a time.  
3.15.1.1.5.2  Note: An RBC acting as both Accepting and Handing Over RBC for the same engine 
may as Accepting RBC forward all or parts of route related information it receives as 
Handing Over RBC, but if and how this is done is intentionally not specified.  
3.15.1.1.6  In an RBC/RBC handover, the Accepting RBC is defined by the RBC transition order, 
while the Handing Over RBC is the RBC which the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment 
considers as the supervising RBC when receiving an RBC transition order.  
3.15.1.1.6.1  Exception: clause 3.15.1.3.2 describes a situation when the current Accepting RBC 
becomes the new Handing Over RBC.  
3.15.1.2  Handing Over RBC  
3.15.1.2.1  When the Handing Over RBC detects that a route is set for a train to enter another RBC 
area, it shall send:

 a) Intentionally deleted.  
b) To the Accepting RBC the following information:  
• The ETCS identity of the on -board equipment;  
• The border loc ation that will be passed by the train when entering the Accepting RBC 
area;  
• Current mode of the on -board equipment;  
• For a leading engine  performing a mission in a mode different from Supervised 
Manoeuvre , Train Data  and Train Running Number ; 
• For an engine  in Supervised Manoeuvre mode, safe consist length information  and 
default Train Data;  
• The system versions supported by the on -board equipment;  
• Optionally, for a non -leading engine, the ETCS identity of the leading engine.  
3.15.1.2.1.1  Exception: for successive handove rs, an RBC already acting as Accepting RBC for 
the engine shall only send this information to the next Accepting RBC after the 
information about the train has been received from the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 
equipment.  
3.15.1.2.2  Intentionally deleted . 
3.15.1.2.3  It shall be possible for the Handing Over RBC to request route related information from 
the Accepting RBC, limited to a maximum amount of data.  
3.15.1.2.3.1  Route related information is :  
a) Movement authorities

 o) Level Crossings  
p) Permitted Braking Distance Info rmation  
3.15.1.2.3.2  Note: The amount of information to be sent between the RBCs is depending on the 
implementation trackside.  
3.15.1.2.4  The Handing Over RBC shall send information to an on -board equipment concerning the 
route in advance of the border only if this information ha s been received from the 
Accepting RBC in the Route related information.  
3.15.1.2.4.1  Note: Route related information received from the Accepting RBC will be processed 
by the Handing Over RBC if possible.  
3.15.1.2.5  Deleted.  
3.15.1.2.6  When the Handing Over RBC receives a position report a nd detects that the maximum 
safe front end of the train has passed the border location, it shall inform the Accepting 
RBC.  
3.15.1.2.6.1  Note: This information might be needed to inform the signalman of the Accepting RBC 
that the train has entered the Accepting RBC area . 
3.15.1.2.7  It is a trackside implementation issue to decide when it is appropriate to send the session 
termination order to the on -board equipment, e.g. w hen the Handing Over RBC receives 
a position report and detects that the minimum safe rear end of the train has  passed the 
border, or after the RBC has received a train integrity confirmation indicating that the 
confirmed rear end of the train has passed the border . 
3.15.1.2.8  When the Accepting RBC informs the Handing Over RBC that it has taken over the 
responsibility, the l atter shall stop sending route related information to the on -board 
equipment.  
3.15.1.2.9  When the Handing Over RBC detects that the transition to the Accepting RBC has to be 
cancelled, it shall send this cancellation information to the Accepting RBC (including the 
train identification).  
3.15.1.2.9.1  Note: For instance, the cancellation procedure can be triggered by:  
• Change to a route which does no more include the border;  
• The need to initiate a Supervised Manoeuvre procedure, after the RBC -RBC 
handover has been e ngaged with an on -board equipment in a mode different from 
Supervised Manoeuvre ; 
• The sending of an “end of mission” information from the on -board equipment.

c) Send a position report to the Handing Over RBC when the minimum safe rear end of

3.15.1.3.2  Exception to 3.15.1.3.1 a) (degraded situation) , only  if the following conditions are 
fulfilled:  
a) the GSM -R radio system is installed on -board, AND  
b) the on-board equipmen t is able to handle only one communication session 
established through GSM -R at a given time, AND  
c) the communication session with the Handing Over RBC has been established through 
GSM -R, AND  
d) the Radio Network type is GSM -R or is FRMCS+GSM -R while the RBC tr ansition 
order does not relate to an RBC interfaced with FRMCS only,  
the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment  shall wait until the session with the Handing over 
RBC is terminated due to crossing the border , apply the clause 3.5.6.6 (if relevant ), and 
then establi sh the session with the Accepting RBC  after successful registration of the 
GSM -R Mobile Terminal to the new GSM -R Radio Network (if relevant) . 
3.15.1.3.2.1  Justification: in case of loss of safe radio connection with the Handing over RBC, the 
only GSM -R Mobile Terminal  still available cannot be pre -empted to set -up a safe radio 
connection with the Accepting RBC as long as the Handing over RBC is the supervising 
one. 
3.15.1.3.2.2  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall manage only one RBC/RBC handover 
at a time, therefore a new RBC t ransition order shall replace a previously received order.  
3.15.1.3.2.3  If, whilst in session with both the Handing Over RBC and the Accepting RBC, the 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment receives a new RBC transition order with an 
Accepting RBC different than the current on e from the RBC/RBC handover already 
engaged, the communication session with the RBC which is not the currently supervising 
RBC shall be terminated, while the currently supervising RBC remains or becomes the 
Handing Over RBC. Then after the clause s 3.15.1.3 .1 and 3.15.1.3.2 (if relevant)  shall

Handing over RBC is terminated due to crossing the border, the on -board receives a 
new RBC transition order with an Accepting RBC different than the current one as per 
the RBC/RBC handover already engaged and if the maximum safe front end of the train 
has left the area of the current Handing Over RBC when this new RBC t ransition order 
is received, the communication session with the current Handing Over RBC shall be 
terminated, the registration of its GSM -R Mobile Terminal in working condition to the 
ordered GSM -R Radio Network (if any) shall be performed (see 3.5.6.6) , and the 
communication session shall be established with the Accepting RBC from the previous 
RBC transition order, which becomes the new Handing Over RBC. Then after, the

4 Use of received information.  
3.15.1.3.7  When the train front end passes the announced border or when an order to execute the 
RBC transition immediately i s received, the on -board shall substitute the current valid 
RBC contact information  with those of the Accepting RBC . 
3.15.1.3.8  After this substitution, the on -board shall however retain the RBC contact information  of 
the Handing Over RBC until at least one of the fo llowing conditions is fulfilled:  
a) The communication session with this Handing Over RBC has been terminated,  
b) The RBC transition order is deleted according to 4.10.  
3.15.1.3.8.1  Note: Even after the train front end has passed the border, the on -board may have to 
maintain the communication session with the Handing Over RBC (see 3.5.4) or re -
establish it (see 3.5.3.4 f) ) and needs therefore to remember the RBC contact information

If no reply is received within the fixed waiting time after the last repe tition, the 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall terminate the communication session with the 
Handing Over RBC.  
3.15.1.4  Accepting RBC  
3.15.1.4.1  The Accepting RBC shall keep route related information sent to the Handing Over RBC 
updated. In particular, this possibly includes temporary speed restrictions.  
3.15.1.4.2  As soon as the Accepting RBC receives from the on -board equipment a position report 
and detects that the maximum safe front end of the train has passed the border, it shall 
inform the Handing Over RBC that it has taken over th e responsibility.  
3.15.1.4.3  When the Accepting RBC receives Train Data from both the on -board equipment and 
the Handing over RBC Train Data provided by the on -board equipment shall take 
precedence.  
3.15.1.4.4  If the Accepting RBC receives a cancellation information from the Ha nding Over RBC, it 
shall send an order to terminate the communication session to the corresponding on -
board equipment (if already established).  
3.15.1.4.5  The Accepting RBC shall comply with the maximum amount of data contained in the last 
received route related info rmation request from the Handing Over RBC.  
3.15.1.4.6  An Accepting RBC shall only give a transition order for a successive RBC/RBC handover 
after t he on -board has reported as LRBG the balise group at the RBC/RBC border for 
the already ongoing RBC/RBC handover or a ba lise group in advance of that border.  
3.15.1.5  RBC/RBC message acknowledgement  
3.15.1.5.1  As soon as a consistent RBC/RBC message including the request for acknowledgement 
is received, the receiving RBC shall send an acknowledgement to the emitting RBC.  
3.15.1.5.2  The RBC/RBC message is  consistent  when all checks have been completed 
successfully:  
a) It has passed the checks performed by the RBC/RBC Safe Communication Interface 
protocol (see SUBSET -098);  
b) Variables in the message do not have invalid values.  
3.15.1.5.3  The acknowledgement message shall r efer to the identity of the concerned message 
sent by the emitting RBC.  
3.15.2  Handling of Trains with Non Leading Engines  
3.15.2.1  It is possible to operate a train using more than one engine, each engine being under 
the control of a driver.  
3.15.2.2  Only the leading engine is responsible for the train movement supervision functions.

 3.15.3  Splitting/joining  
3.15.3.1  ERTMS/ETCS allow s Splitting and Joining using the normal supervision functions 
available (e.g. On -sight, Shunting).  
3.15.3.2  Splitting only refers to the case that the two resulting trains contain at least one 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment each.  
3.15.3.2.1  Note: This must be ensured by operat ional procedures.  
3.15.3.3  ERTMS/ETCS is not responsible for providing information that a Splitting/Joining 
operation has been correctly completed (technical aspect and/or operational aspect).  
3.15.3.4  Justification: ERTMS/ETCS is not able to provide this information. Split ting and Joining 
require s the fulfilment of operating rules ensuring that a Splitting/Joining operation has 
been correctly completed (e.g. physical disconnection).  
3.15.4  Reversing of movement direction  
3.15.4.1  It shall be possible to send in advance to an on -board equip ment information about 
areas, where initiation of reversing of movement direction is possible, i.e. change the 
direction of train movement without changing the train orientation.  
3.15.4.1.1  A new reversing area given from the trackside shall replace the one already a vailable 
on-board.  
3.15.4.2  Together with start and end of reversing area, the following supervision information shall 
be sent:  
a) Maximum distance to run in the direction opposite to the orientation of the reversing 
area, the fixed reference location being the end lo cation of the area where reversing 
of movement is permitted  with which the maximum distance information is sent . 
b) Reversing mode  speed limit allowed during reverse movement.

 3.15.5  Track ahead free  
3.15.5.1  In a level 2 area, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment is able to handle a track ahead 
free request gi ven by the RBC.  
3.15.5.2  The track ahead free request from the RBC shall indicate to the on -board  
a) at which location the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall begin to display the 
request to the driver.  
b) at which location the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall stop to  display the 
request to the driver (in case the driver did not acknowledge).  
3.15.5.3  As long as it is displayed, t he driver ha s the possibility to acknowledge the track ahead 
free request (meaning the driver confirms that the track between the head of the train 
and the next signal or board marking signal position is free).  
3.15.5.4  When the driver acknowledges, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall stop 
displaying the request, and shall inform the RBC that the track ahead is free.  
3.15.5.5  There is no restrictive consequence by th e on -board system if the driver does not 
acknowledge.  
3.15.5.6  A new track ahead free request shall replace the one previously received and stored.  
3.15.6  Handling of National Systems  
3.15.6.1  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board support s driving on national infrastructure u nder the 
supervision of National Systems .

3.15.6.5  Amongst the  data to be used by applications outside ERTMS/ETCS that can be 
transmitted by trackside over the ERTMS/ETCS transmission channels,  it shall be 
possible , only from balise  as non-infill information or from RBC , to identify a National 
System to which the  data will be forwarded by the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment in 
case it is interfaced to this National System  through an STM . 
3.15.6.5.1  Note: In case the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment is not interfaced to the concerned 
National System through an STM,  the way the data is forwarded  to the National System  
is outside the scope of the ERTMS/ETCS specifications. However, the trackside has to 
take into account that any ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment interfaced to the 
concerned National System through an STM will apply all the ap plicable ERTMS/ETCS 
rules to the balise group/RBC message that includes this data .

 3.15.7  Tolerance of Big Metal Mass  
3.15.7.1  Big metal object in the track, exceeding the limits for big metal masses as defined in 
Subset -036, section 6.5.2 “Metal Masses in the Track” may trigger an alarm (called 
“Integrity check alarm of balise transmission”, and referred in the following as “BTM 
alarm” in short) reporting a malfunction for the onboard balise transmission function.  
3.15.7.2  In Levels 0/ NTC, the alarms which may be triggered by meta l masses shall be ignored 
for a defined distance (see A .3.1). If the alarm persists for a longer distance the 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall trigger a safety reaction.  
3.15.7.3  Justification: Ignoring the alarm for a defined distance eliminates the need to equip all 
excessive big metal masses with track condition “Big Metal Mass” outside ETCS fitted 
areas.  
3.15.7.4  In Level s 1/2, the BTM alarms which may be triggered by metal masses shall be ignored 
in any of the following cases:  
a) if the “BTM alarm reaction inhibition ” is active (see procedure in 5.2 2), or 
b) if mode is Stand -By. 
3.15.7.5  In all Levels, the BTM alarms which may be triggered by metal masses shall be ignored 
if the track condition “Big Metal Mass” is applicable for the given location (see 3.12.1.3, 
9th bullet).  
3.15.7.6  If the BTM alarm is triggered and not ignored according to 3.15.7.4 or 3.15.7.5, the 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall trigger a safety reaction.  
3.15.7.6.1  Note: the on -board reaction is left to specific implementation because it contributes to 
the attainment of the global on -board THR, whose apportionment is on -board -
implementation specific.  
3.15.8  Cold Movement Detection  
3.15.8.1  After being switched off (i.e. once in No Power mode), the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 
equipment shall be capable, if fitted with, to detect and record whether th e engine has 
been moved or not, during a period of at least 72 hours.  
3.15.8.1.1  To allow small movements e.g. for coupling in No Power mode, the ERTMS/ETCS on -
board equipment shall consider that no cold movement has occurred as long as the train 
does not move for mo re than 2m away from the train position stored when No Power 
mode was entered.  
3.15.8.2  When powered on again, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall use, if available, 
the memorised information about cold movement in order to update the status of 
information stor ed by on -board equipment (see chapter 4 section 4.11 for details).  
3.15.8.3  Note: information memorised by Cold Movement Detection function is considered as not 
available if:

 a) no Cold Movement Detection function is implemented in the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 
equipment, O R 
b) the Cold Movement Detection function has encountered a condition, during the No 
Power period, which prevents the use of the Cold Movement information (e.g. the 
battery ensuring the Cold Movement Detection function has run down during the No 
Power period) . 
3.15.9  Virtual Balise Cover  
3.15.9.1  It shall be possible to set and remove from balise a Virtual Balise Cover (VBC) . A VBC 
is defined by:  
a) A marker corresponding to balises to be ignored by the on -board together with the 
area (country or region) in which the VBC is appl icable. The VBC marker and the 
country/region identity form the unique VBC identity . 
b) Its validity period.  
3.15.9.2  During a start of mission, the driver shall have the opportunity to set a new VBC, or to 
remove an existing one.  
3.15.9.3  As long as a VBC is stored on -board:  
a) While applying any other clause (with the exception of the ones of section 3.20 
"Juridical data") than this one,  the ERTMS/ETC S on-board equipment shall consider  
any balise telegram that includes  a VBC marker  and a country/region identity that both 
match t he VBC identity  as not received (i.e. as if the balise was physically covered) . 
b) As a consequence, n o reaction will be applied if errors in the reading of the rest of 
such balise telegram occur.  
3.15.9.3.1  Since it relies on the system version number of the telegram itself (see chapter 6 for 
details), the check stipulated in 3.15.9.3 a) shall prevail on any system version number 
related check specified in the section 3.17, with the exception of 3.17.3.5 a).  
3.15.9.4  If the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment receives from b alise or from driver a new VBC 
with the same VBC identity as an already stored VBC, the new VBC shall replace the 
previous one, including its validity period.  
3.15.9.5  A VBC shall be retained on -board when the on -board equipment is switched off (i.e. 
enters No Powe r mode) and shall remain applicable when powered on again . It shall be 
deleted when:  
a) it is ordered by trackside, or  
b) its validity period has elapsed, or  
c) it is removed by the d river (during Start of Mission), or  
d) a mismatch is detected between the country/region identity read from  a balise group 
and the country/region identity of the VBC. Not e: this means that the reception of a

 consistent balise group message is a necessary condition for deleting  a VBC due to 
mism atching country/region iden tities. 
3.15.9.6  The validity period shall start at the time the balise group message is received or shall 
start at the time the VBC is entered by the driver.  
3.15.10  Advance display of route related information  
3.15.10.1  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall display an overview of the gradient profile 
(as received from trackside), of the MRSP, of the track conditions  (except the tunnel 
stopping areas , big metal masses, changes of allowed current consumption and station 
platforms ), of the first I ndication  location , if any (only in Ceiling Speed monitoring ), and 
of the EOA/LOA , with the remaining distances referred to the train front end position.  
3.15.10.2  With regards to the MRSP, the track conditions and the EOA/LOA , the remaining 
distances shall be computed takin g into account the min safe, the estimated or the max 
safe train front end position depending on their respective supervision.  
3.15.10.3  With regards to the gradient profile, the remaining distances shall be computed taking 
into account the estimated train front end  position.  
3.15.10.3.1  With regards to the first Indication location, the remaining distance shall be computed as 
specified in clauses 3.13.10.3.8 and 3.13.10.3.8.1.  
3.15.10.4  The overview of route related information shall be restricted to the elements contained 
within the mov ement authority and up to the first target at zero speed, if any.  
3.15.10.5  When the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment applies at least one of the clauses 
3.12.2.4, 3.12.4.7 and 3.12.5.8, the term EOA in this section 3.15.10 shall refer to the 
closest location amongst t he temporary EOA(s) and the EOA.  
3.15.11  Driving with Automatic Train Operation  
3.15.11.1  In case it is interfaced to an ERTMS/ATO on -board, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 
equipment supports automatic driving on lines fitted with an ERTMS/ATO trackside 
subsystem.  
3.15.11.2  The driver shall have the possibility, through an ATO selector, to enable/disable the 
automatic driving and the display of the information related to the ERTMS/ATO 
subsystem, with the exception of the ATO data entry/view. The ATO selector position 
("On" or "Stand -by") appl icable when the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment is switched 
off (i.e. enters No Power mode) shall be retained and shall remain applicable when 
powered on.  
3.15.11.3  For detailed requirements in case the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment is interfaced 
to an ERTMS/ATO on -board, refer to chapter 4 and SUBSET -125.

 3.16 Data Consistency  
3.16.1  General  
3.16.1.1  The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall consider a message received  from the 
trackside as inconsistent if  it is not compliant with the ETCS specifications . 
3.16.1.1.1  As a minimum, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall consider the use of  a spare 
value of a variable as not compliant with the ETCS specifications . Having in mind that 
the trackside messages are presumed to be compliant with the ETCS specifications, it 
is however not in th e scope of this specification to list the other checks that the 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment might consider to determine that a message is not 
compliant with them.

consistency of the information from balises, see 3.16.2.  
3.16.1.3  For the other inconsistency criteria, reactions and other functionality related to the 
consistency of the information from radio, see 3.16.3.  
3.16.1.4  Unless stated otherwise, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipmen t shall reject a message 
that fulfils any inconsistency criteria.  
3.16.2  Balises  
3.16.2.1  Definitions  
3.16.2.1.1  The information that is sent from a balise is called a balise telegram.  
3.16.2.1.2  The whole set of information (balise telegram or telegrams) coming from a balise group 
is called a  balise group message.  
3.16.2.1.2.1  Note: In case of a balise group containing a single balise, telegram and message 
coincide.

3.16.2.2.1  If the on -board is not able to recognise whether a balise group is linked or unlinked (if 
none of the balises  in the balise group can be read correctly), it shall consider it as 
unlinked.  
3.16.2.2.2  A balise within a balise group shall be regarded as missed if  
a) No balise is detected (see SUBSET -036 sections 4.2.4.1 and 4.2.4.2)  within the 
maximum distance between balises fro m the previous balise in the group , or 
b) A following balise within the group is received , or

 3.16.2.3  Linking Consistency  
3.16.2.3.1  If linking consistency  is checked  the on -board shall react according to the linking reaction 
information in the following cases:  
a) If the location reference of the expected balise group is detected (see SUBSET -036 
sections 4.2.4.1 and 4.2.4.2)  in rear of the expectation window  
b) If the location reference of the expected balise group is not detected (see SUBSET -
036 sections 4.2.4.1 and 4.2.4.2)  inside the expectation window  
c) If inside the expectation window of the expected balise group a balise from another 
announced balise group, expected later, is received . 
3.16.2.3.1.1  For a balise group location reference not detected at all , the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 
equipment shall consider the criterion 3.16.2.3.1 b) as fulfilled  only once the min safe 
antenna position has passed the last possible location of the balise group plus 1.3m, for 
a time equal to:  
a) 100 ms for balise groups to be pas sed in nominal direction  
b) Tn (see SUBSET -036 clause 4.2.9) for balise groups to be passed in reverse 
direction.

group, and is detected (see SUBSET -036 sections 4.2.4.1 and 4.2.4.2)  within the 
expectation window, no linking reaction shall be applied.  
3.16.2.4  Balise Group Message Con sistency  
3.16.2.4.1  The on -board shall react according to the linking reaction when  the message from a 
balise group announced by linking, whose location reference was detected (see 
SUBSET -036 sections 4.2.4.1 and 4.2.4.2)  inside its expect ation  window  or whose 
expect ation window is currently supervised , fulfils the general inconsistency criterion 
3.16.1.1 or any of  the following inconsistency criteria : 
a) A balise is missed inside the group.  
b) A balise is detected but no telegram is decoded (e.g. wrong CRC,...).  
c) Intentiona lly deleted . 
d) Message counters do not match (see 3.16.2.4.7)  
3.16.2.4.2  Exception: Even if it considers the message as inconsistent due to either  a) or b) above  
but the balise missed , or not decoded, is duplicated within the balise group and the 
duplicating one is cor rectly read , the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall not reject 
the message and shall not apply the linking reaction.

fulfilled, no reaction shall be applied, even if errors in the reading of the balise group 
occur. Rationale: the balise group can for sure not be the expected one (i.e. the one 
which contains repositioning info rmation valid for the train orientation) ; 
b) in all other cases  and if an error in the reading of the balise group occurs , the linking 
reaction shall be applied. Rationale: it cannot be excluded  that the balise group is the 
expected one (i.e. the one which co ntains repositioning information valid for the train 
orientation) because e.g. one of the missed or not decoded balise(s) does contain the 
repositioning information valid for the train orientation or e.g. although a balise 
containing repositioning informat ion has been correctly received the balise group 
orientation cannot be determined from the balise group itself . 
3.16.2.4.4  If linking consistency  is not checked , the on -board shall command application of the 
service brake when  the message from a balise group marked as linked fulfils the general 
inconsistency criterion 3.16.1.1 or any of  the following inconsistency criteria : 
a) A balise is missed inside the group.  
b) A balise is detected, but no telegram is decoded (e.g. wrong CRC).  
c) Intentionally deleted . 
d) Message counters do not match (see 3.16.2.4.7)  
3.16.2.4.4.1  Exception s: Even if it considers the message as inconsistent due to either  a) or b) of 
clause 3.16.2.4.4, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment :  
a) shall not reject the message and shall not co mmand application of the service brake 
if the balise missed , or not decoded, is duplicated within the balise group, the 
duplicating one is correctly read and contains:  
• directional information while the orientation of the balise group can still be 
evaluated , or 
• only information valid for both directions, or  
• neither directional information nor information valid for both directions , or 
• only data to be used by applications outside ERTMS/ETCS, or  
• only data to be used by applications outside ERTMS/ETCS  together with other 
information valid for both directions .

 b) shall not command application of the service brake if the telegram correctly read from 
another balise of the group contains the information “Inhibition of balise group 
message consistency reaction”.  
3.16.2.4.4.2  Concerning clause 3.16.2.4.4, if the service brake is applied, the location based 
information stored on -board shall be shortened to the current position when the train has 
reached standstill.  Refer to appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of information,  which 
shall be shortened.  
3.16.2.4.4.3  Concerning clause 3.16.2.4.4, if the service brake is applied, the driver shall be 
informed that this is due to a balise group message consistency problem.  
3.16.2.4.4.4  Exception: Concerning clause 3.16.2.4.4, if the balise group was the last  announced 
one by linking and the linking consistency is no longer checked as per 3.4.4.4.6 a), the 
on-board shall apply the clause 3.16.2.4.1 instead.  
3.16.2.4.5  A message counter shall be attached to each balise telegram indicating which balise 
group message the te legram fits to.  
3.16.2.4.6  Instead of a message counter corresponding to a given balise group message, it shall 
be possible to identify a telegram as always fitting all possible messages of the group.  
3.16.2.4.6.1  It shall also be possible to identify a telegram as never fitting any message of the 
group.  
3.16.2.4.7  Comparing message counters of the received telegrams of a balise group message, 
excluding the ones complying with 3.16.2.4.6  and the ones that are not used by the on -
board to compose the message (see 3.16.2.4.8.2) , if their values  are not al l identical, or 
at least one of  them complies with 3.16.2.4.6.1, th e message shall be considered as 
inconsisten t. 
3.16.2.4.7.1  In case of single balise group, if the message counter of the received telegram 
complies with 3.16.2.4.6.1, th e message  shall also be considered as inconsisten t. 
3.16.2.4.8  It shall be possible to indicate failures in the system underlying the balise/loop/RIU (e.g. 
the Lineside Electronic Unit, LEU) by sending a balise telegram, a loop message or a 
RIU message including the information "default balise/loop/RIU information".  
3.16.2.4.8.1  If one (and only one) out of a pair of duplicated balise telegrams received by the on -
board includes the information “default balise information”, the on -board shall ignore any 
other information included i n this telegram and shall consider information from the 
telegram not containing “default balise information".  
3.16.2.4.8.2  When duplicated balises are both received  and decoded correctly, and both, or none 
of them, contain "default balise information", the ERTMS/ETCS o n-board equipment 
shall compose the message using only the information  from the last received balise 
telegram out of the pair.

 3.16.2.4.8.2.1  Exception: The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall also include in the message 
all received data that is to be forwarded to a Nat ional System through the STM interface 
(see 3.15.6) which is contained in the first received balise telegram out of the pair.  
3.16.2.4.9  If a message has been received containing the information "default balise information", 
the driver shall be informed.  
3.16.2.5  Unlinked Bal ise Group Message Consistency  
3.16.2.5.1  The on-board equipment shall command application of the service brake when  the 
message received from a balise group marked as unlinked fulfils the general 
inconsistency criterion 3.16.1.1 or any of the following inconsistency criteria : 
a) A balise is missed inside the unlinked balise group.  
b) A balise is detected, but no telegram is decoded (e.g. wrong CRC).  
c) Intentionally deleted . 
d) Message counters do not match (see 3.16.2.4.7)  
3.16.2.5.1.1  Exception s: Even if it considers the message as inconsistent due to either  a) or b) of 
clause 3.16.2.5.1, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment : 
a)  shall not reject the message and shall not command application of the service brake 
if the balise missed , or not decoded, is duplicated within the balise group, t he 
duplicating one is correctly read and contains:  
• directional information while the orientation of the balise group can still be 
evaluated , or 
• only information valid for both directions, or  
• neither directional information nor information valid for both di rections , or 
• only data to be used by applications outside ERTMS/ETCS, or  
• only data to be used by applications outside ERTMS/ETCS  together with other

b) shall not command application of the service brake if the telegram c orrectly read from 
another balise of the group contains the information “Inhibition of balise group 
message consistency reaction”.  
3.16.2.5.2  Concerning clause 3.16.2.5.1, if the service brake is applied, the location based

 3.16.2.6  Linking Reactions  
3.16.2.6.1  When the linking reaction leads to train trip or a service brake application, the driver shall 
be informed that the intervention is due to data consistency problem with the expecte d 
balise group.  
3.16.2.6.2  If the service brake is initiated due to the linking reaction, the location based information 
stored on -board shall be shortened to the current position when the train has reached 
standstill.  Refer to appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of information, which shall be 
shortened.  
3.16.2.7  RAMS related supervision functions  
3.16.2.7.1  Mitigation of balise detec tion degradation  
3.16.2.7.1.1  If no balise is detected between the start of the expectation window of a balise group 
announced by linking and the end of the expectation window of the next balise group 
announced by linking , the ERTMS/ETCS on -board shall command the service brake  and 
the driver shall be informed . At standstill, the location based information stored on -board 
shall be shortened to the current position.  Refer to appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list 
of information, which shall be shortened.  
3.16.2.7.2  Mitigation of balise cross -talk while expecting repositioning information  
3.16.2.7.2.1  If repositioning is announced and the expected  repositioning balise group has been 
received , the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall keep looking for a balise group 
that satisfies the same criteria as this previously expected and already received  
repositioning balise group, until one of the following events occurs:  
a) the min safe antenna position leaves the expectation window of the repositioning 
balise group that was announced and already received  
b) a linked balise group that has been announced with known identity is received . 
3.16.2.7.2.2  If a second balise group is received  that satisfies the same criteria as the previously 
expected and already received  repositioning balise group, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 
equipment shall command the service brake  and the driver shall be informed . At 
standst ill, the location based information stored on -board  shall be shortened to the 
current position. Refer to appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of information, which shall 
be shortened.  
3.16.2.7.2.3  Note: this function is independent from linking consistency check function, i.e. the 
rules related to linking always apply. This means that once a repositioning balise group 
has been received  and if this latter contains new linking information, the ERTMS/ETCS 
on-board equipment will start expecting the first balise group ann ounced in this new 
linking information in parallel with the monitoring specified in 3.16.2.7.2.1.

3.16.3.2  Time stamping  
3.16.3.2.1  The trackside shall always transmit its information with reference to the train time.  
3.16.3.2.2  To time -stamp its messages, th e trackside shall make a safe estimation of the on -board 
time, based on the time -stamp of the received messages and the internal processing 
times.  The estimation shall be made in such a way that the on -board time estimated by 
the trackside shall not be in advance of the real on -board time.  
3.16.3.2.3  Wrap around of the onboard timer can occur during a communication session and shall 
have no impact on system behaviour.  
3.16.3.3  Supervision of Sequence  
3.16.3.3.1  The trackside shall time -stamp a message with a value corresponding to the ti me of 
sending.  
3.16.3.3.2  There shall always be a time stamp increment between consecutive messages.  
3.16.3.3.3  The on -board shall consider a  message as inconsistent if its time stamp is lower than or 
equal to the time stamp of the preceding message . 
3.16.3.3.3.1  Intentionally deleted .

 3.17.2  Determination of the operated system version  
3.17.2.1  The on -board equipment shall be able to operate with (i.e. shall support) any of  the 
ERTMS/ETCS system version  number s X included in its envelope of supported  system 
versions, as defined in chapter 6.  
3.17.2.1.1  Within one of its supported system version numbers X, the on -board equipment shall 
always operate the highest system version number Y d efined in its envelope of supported 
system versions , regardless of the system version number Y transmitted by the 
trackside.  
3.17.2.2  The on -board equipment shall operate with only one system version at a time, i.e. it shall 
behave according to the whole set of req uirements applicable to a system version (refer 
to chapter 6 in case the operated system version is older than the last one introduced in 
this release of the SRS).  
3.17.2.3  The on -board equipment shall determine the operated system version  number X , in 
relation to non-RBC trackside constituents, as the highest system version number X 
transmitted in the telegrams forming a balise group message (i.e. the telegrams which 
are not ignored as per a clause referred to in the column "Telegram" of the Table 17) , or 
as the sy stem version number X transmitted by a loop whose message is not ignored as 
per a clause referred to in the column "Message" of the Table 17 , or as the system 
version number X transmitted by an RIU, if this system version number X is higher than 
the curren tly operated one.  
3.17.2.4  It shall be possible from balise group to order the on -board equipment to operate a 
system version.  
3.17.2.5  Once a balise group message has been receiv ed, if one of the telegrams forming the 
message (i.e. a telegram which is not ignored as per a clause referred to in the column 
"Telegram" of the Table 17) includes an  order to operate system version which would 
not be ignored as per a clause referred to in the column "Individual information" of the 
Table 17 , the on -board equipment shall immediately  operate the system version number 
X given in the order , regardless of the clauses 3.17.2.3 and 3.17.2.6 . After the order is 
executed, the clauses  3.17.2.3 and 3.17.2.6 shall again appl y for any further received 
balise group /loop message or any further contacted RIU.  
3.17.2.5.1  Note: the system version order is to be used wherever it is necessary to enforce an 
operated system version number X lower than the currently operated one.  
3.17.2.6  If a mismatch has been detected between the country or region identifier read  from a 
balise  group /loop and the corresponding identifier(s) of the  applicable  set of national 
values, the on -board equipment shall consider the highest system version number X 
transmitted in the telegrams forming the balise group message (i.e. telegrams which are 
not ignored as per a clause referred to in the column "Telegram" of the Table 17) or the 
system version number X transmitted by the loop whose message is not ignored as per  
a clause referred to in the column "Message" of the Table 17 , as the oper ated one and 
shall comply again with requirement 3.17.2.3.  For balise groups, the on -board equipment

 shall take into account, if any, the country or region identifier(s) of a set of national values 
applicable immediately, which is included in a telegram forming the balise group 
message and which would not be ignored as per a clause referred to in the column 
"Individual information" of the Table 17.  
3.17.2.7  If the on -board equipment does not support the system version number X transmitted by 
a non -RBC trackside constituent or the one specified in the balise group order, it shall 
consider the operated system version as unchanged.  
3.17.2.8  In case of communication session established with an RBC, the system version number 
X of the RBC shall take precedence on the operated system version in relation to non -
RBC constituents and on system version ordered from balise group; the operated system 
version number X shall be determined according to the following principles:  
a) if the on -board equipment is in level 0, NTC or 1 ( e.g. entrance in level 2 area), the 
RBC system version number X shall be operated when the transition to level 2 is 
executed;  
b) if the on -board equipment is in level 2 (SoM procedure or order received from 
trackside), the RBC system version number X shall be  operated immediately;  
c) in case of session established with an accepting RBC (RBC/RBC Handover), the 
accepting RBC system version number X shall be operated as soon as the train has 
passed the RBC/RBC border location with its maximum safe front end;  
d) in case  the on -board equipment switches from level 2 to another level (e.g. exit from 
a level 2 area), the system version control in relation to non -RBC constituents shall 
be again applied and the balise group orders shall be again considered;  
e) in case the engine passes the RBC/RBC border location with its maximum safe front 
end and no session is established with the accepting RBC, the system version control 
in relation to non -RBC constituents shall be again applied and the balise group orders 
shall be again consid ered.  
3.17.2.8.1  For item a): if the switch from level 0, NTC or 1 to level 2 results from an immediate level 
transition order or a conditional level transition order received from balise group and if 
the RBC system version number X is different from the system versi on number X 
operated before the level transition, the checks of the raw balise group message and the 
evaluation of its whole content shall be performed taking into account the RBC system 
version and shall substitute the checks and evaluation performed befo rehand with 
regards to the previously operated system version.  
3.17.2.8.2  For item d): if the switch from level 2 to another level results from an immediate level 
transition order or a conditional level transition order received from balise group, the 
clauses 3.17.2. 3, 3.17.2.5 and 3.17.2.6 shall be immediately checked to determine 
whether a change of operated system version occurs. If so, the checks of the raw balise 
group message and the evaluation of its whole content shall be performed taking into 
account the new operated system version and shall substitute the checks and evaluation 
performed beforehand with regards to the previously operated system version.

3.17.3.3  Except for the balises whose telegram is ignored as per clause 3.14.3.6 or 3.15.9.3 a), 
the on -board equipment shall check the system version transmitted by the balises/loops 
and then shall determine the operated system version prior to any further checks (data 
consistency, ...) and evaluation of the oth er data included in a balise group/loop 
message , as they may depend on the system version.  
3.17.3.4  If any of the further checks that are referred to in the column "Message" of the Table 17 
leads to the rejection of the whole balise group/loop message, any change o f operated 
system version due to the application of clause 3.17.2.3, 3.17.2.5 or 3.17.2.6 shall be 
revoked by the on -board equipment, i.e. the operated system version prior to the 
reception of the balise group/loop message remains unchanged . 
3.17.3.4.1  Note: the clau ses 3.17.3.3 and 3.17.3.4 imply that on reception of a balise group/loop 
message the on -board equipment checks first the information which may impact the 
determination of the operated system version as per clauses 3.17.2.3, 3.17.2.5 or 
3.17.2.6 (i.e. the s ystem version transmitted by the balises/loop/RIU, the country or 
region identifiers of a set of National Values applicable immediately and a system version 
order). Then, upon a change of operated system version, the other information included 
in the messa ge received from the balise group or loop will be checked and evaluated 
considering the newly operated system version. However, should the whole balise 
group/loop message be rejected due to e.g. linking, no change of operated system 
version will take place .

3.18 System Data  
3.18.1  Fixed Values  
3.18.1.1  Note: Appendix to chapter 3 contains a list of Fixed values used as system parameters 
in the supervision. These parameters are system related and can easily be changed in 
later versions of  the ERTMS/ETCS if required. These parameters are not defined as 
National data.  
3.18.2  National / Default Values  
3.18.2.1  Note: Appendix to chapter 3 contains list of National and Default Values.  
3.18.2.2  Trains shall be supervised according to the National Values of the current infrastructure 
if they are available on -board.  
3.18.2.3  National Values are transmitted with the area(s) (country or region) in which they are 
applicable. They shall be come  applicable at a defined location, or shall be applicable 
immediately.  
3.18.2.4  Evaluating a balise gr oup message, the balise identity information referring to the country 
or region shall be used to ensure that correct National Values are used.  
3.18.2.5  For each National Value, the corresponding Default Value shall be used as fall back 
value if:  
• the National Value is not available, or  
• a mismatch has been detected between the country or region identifier read from a 
balise group and the corresponding identifier(s) of the applicable  set with which the  
National Value was received and stored . 
3.18.2.6  Note: even though the National Values are always transmitted as a single  set for a given 
system version, the content of a set depends on the system version, so that when a set

 of National Values is received or becomes applicable, or when passing a balise group, 
the on -board equipment may apply clause 3.18.2.5 for a subset of National Values  
3.18.2.7  The National Values currently applicable when the on -board equipment is switched off 
(i.e. enters No Power mode) shall be retained and shall remain  applicable  when powered 
on. 
3.18.2.7.1  Justification:  The aim of this requirement is to limit the number of balise groups 
containing National Value information. Once a set of National Values has been received 
on-board, there is no need to re -load the informatio n unless National Values change, the 
on-board equipment loses the information (failure situation), or the train enters an area 
requiring different National Values.  
3.18.2.8  The applicable set of National Values data shall be transmitted from the trackside on 
transi tion between areas requiring a different set of National Values.  
3.18.2.8.1  When a new set of National Values becomes applicable it s content  shall always overwrite 
the corresponding National Values  currently applicable regardless of the country or 
region identifier(s ). 
3.18.2.9  A previously received set of National Values which is not yet applicable shall be deleted 
if: 
• a new set of National Values is received, or  
• the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment is switched off (i.e., enters No Power mode).  
3.18.2.10  If a National Value becomes invali d, i.e., a mismatch has been detected between the 
country or region identifier read from a balise group and the corresponding identifier(s) 
of the applicable  set with which  the National Value was received and stored , then it shall 
be deleted.  
3.18.2.11  When a new se t of National Values becomes applicable, any ongoing supervision 
involving a n overwritten  National Value of type time or distance shall continue , but using 
the corresponding value from the new set. However, the starting location or starting time 
shall rema in unchanged.  
3.18.3  Train Data  
3.18.3.1  Train Data can neither be provided nor modified by ERTMS/ETCS trackside equipment.  
3.18.3.2  Before s tarting a mission  in a mode different from Supervised Manoeuvre , the Train Data 
shall be acquired by the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment  of a leading engine  
a) Train category (ies) 
b) Train length : 
• Either the safe consist length

 • Or any value that is obtained by means of a process which involves the driver 
or by means of a process or an external source with a safety level that could be 
lower than the one for the safe consist length  
c) Traction / brake parameters : 
• Traction model  
• Braking models ( brake reaction time, brake build up time and speed dependent 
deceleration) or brake percentage  
• Brake position  
• On-board correction factors  
• Nominal rotating mass

3.18.3.2.1  The Train Data may come from ERT MS/ETCS external sources (e.g. the Train Interface), 
from pre -configured values or from the driver.  
3.18.3.2.2  Exception: The driver shall never be involved in the entry/ modification/validation of the 
Train Data “safe consist length”, “Traction system(s) accepted by  the engine”, “List of 
National Systems  available on -board” and “Axle number” . 
3.18.3.2.3  The unit, range and resolution of the Train Data that can be directly entered by the driver 
shall be as specified in A.3.11.  
3.18.3.2.4  In the clauses where the term “safe consist length” is not explicitly used, the term “train 
length” shall be interpreted as referring to the overall length of the train from one 
extremity to the other one. When no valid Train Data is available but  the safe consist 
length is available, the term “train length ” shall refer to the sum of the max safe consist 
lengths in front of and in rear of the engine respectively.  When the safe consist length is 
captured as part of valid Train Data, the term “train length” shall refer to the max safe 
consist length in rear of  the engine.  
3.18.3.2.5  If the safe consist  length information is acquired from an external source and it becomes 
unavailable while performing a mission, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall 
nevertheless consider the Train Data “safe consist length” as unchanged.

 3.18.3.2.5.1  From the time the first Supervised Manoeuvre authorisation is received to the time 
the mission is either ended or continued in Non Leading mode , the train front end 
information shall still be derived from the safe consist length values in front or in rear of 
the engine, which are stored on -board as Train Data  
3.18.3.2.5.2  Note: when no valid Train Data is stored on -board, the continuous availability of the 
safe consist length information is however necessary to send position reports with train 
integrity confirmed by ext ernal source or to start or continue a mission in Supervised 
Manoeuvre mode.  
3.18.3.3  At standstill, it shall be possible for the driver to enter, modify and revalidate the Train 
Data that requires driver validation according to the specific train implementation.  
3.18.3.3.1  In normal operation after the start of mission, if a train movement is detected while the 
driver is modifying or revalidating the Train Data, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment 
shall trigger the brake command.  
3.18.3.4  Following any validation of Tra in data /modification of valid Train Data when a 
communication session is already established or following the successful establishment 
of a communication session when valid Train Data are already available (e.g. when 
approaching a level 2 area or an accept ing RBC area), the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 
equipment of the leading engine shall send the following set of Train Data to the RBC : 
a) Train category (ies). 
b) Train length.  
c) Maximum train speed.

3.18.3.4.2  In case the safe radio connection is lost before the acknowledgement is received, the 
Train Data shall be sent again once the safe radio connection has been re -established 
within the ongoing communication session.  
3.18.3.5  If the safe consist length information is available and as long a s the safe consist length 
in front of the engine, taking into account the side of the active cab which defines the 
front of the engine,  is different from zero:  
a) The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall consider that no valid Train Data is 
stored on -board

 b) By exception to 3.18.3.3, the entry, modification and revalidation of Train Data that 
requires driver validation shall not be possible  
3.18.3.6  For modification of Train Data , which is/are affected by a change of input information 
from the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipmen t external interface , refer to procedure 
"Changing Train Data from sources different from the driver" described in section 5.17.  
3.18.3.7  In case the Train Data regarding train category, axle load  category , loading gauge or 
traction system  has been changed  and the train is at standstill : 
a) the location based information stored on -board  shall be shortened to the current 
position of the train . Refer to appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of information, 
which shall be shortened.  
b) the stored MA, linking and track descr iption, which have been received from the RBC 
after a level 2 transition or a n RBC transition for a further location has been ordered, 
shall be deleted.  
3.18.3.8  In case valid Train Data is available and the Train Data regarding train length has been 
increased  or in case no valid Train Data is available  but the Train Data “safe consist 
length” is available and has been increased in the direction opposite to the train 
orientation , the currently used track description, if any, shall be considered as unknown 
in rear of the former min safe rear end of the train . 
3.18.3.9  In order to perform a mission in Supervised Manoeuvre mode with only the Train Data 
“safe consist length” available, the on -board shall be configured with default Train D ata 
for all items of 3.18.3.2 except item b). From the time the first Supervised Manoeuvre 
authorisation is received to the time the mission is either ended or continued in Non 
Leading mode, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall use these default Train D ata 
and shall consider that no valid Train Data is stored on -board.  
3.18.3.10  In Stand -By mode (only in level 2 when a communication session is already established) 
and f rom the time the first Supervised Manoeuvre request is sent to the time the mission

A.3.3 Handling of information received from trackside  
A.3.3.1  Before it can be accepted and used by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment, raw 
information received from trackside is subject to various checks, which can lead to the 
individual rejection/ignoring of information (e.g. Movement Authority not valid for the tra in 
orientation), the ignoring of a whole balise telegram or the rejection of a whole message. 
The SRS clauses/sections corresponding to these checks are gathered in Table 17.

A.3.3.2  With the exception of the clauses/sections referred to in Table 17 and of the clause s 
3.16.3.5.1 , 3.17.2.3 , 3.17.2.5, 3.17.2.6 and 3.17.3.3 , all the clauses in this specification 
and in the SUBSET -035, in which trackside information is referred to (through the terms 
“balise”, “telegram”, “balise group [message]”, “message”, “[name of] information”...), 
shall be applied assuming that the information has not been ignored/rejected by the 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment due to all the checks listed in Table 17. 
A.3.3.3  Example 1: clause 3.16.2.4.9 has to be understood as follows: “If a <consistent> 
message <composed with telegrams that have passed the system ve rsion check, that 
have not been ignored because of a VBC, that have not been ignored because of 
duplication, and that have been received while no movement opposite to the authorised 
direction  was performed> has been received <with one of its telegrams comp osing it> 
containing the information “default balise information” <which is valid for the train 
orientation (or the balise group crossing direction for NL or SL engines) and which has 
passed the level and mode filters>, the driver shall be informed.”  
A.3.3.4  Example 2: as a result of the clause A.3.3.2, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment will 
not apply requirements in relation to the content of the telegram or the message such 
as: 
• clause 3.6.2.2.2 a), in case the balise group message is rejected because  
inconsistent (e.g. according to 3.16.2.4.1), it does not become LRBG  
• clause 3.17.2.3, in case the balise telegram is ignored because of its system version 
number (e.g. according to 3.17.3.5 d)), this latter will not affect the system version 
operated by t he on -board  
• clause 3.18.2.5 2nd bullet, in case a message from a balise group marked as linked 
is rejected because the balise group was not announced by linking (see 3.16.2.4.3), 
the balise group country or region identifier will not be compared with the o ne(s) of 
the currently applicable set of National Values  
A.3.3.5  Example 3: as a result of the clause A.3.3.2, the clause 3.4.1.1 (definition of a balise 
group) has to be understood as follows: “A balise group consists of between one and 
eight balises shar ing the same balise group identity <and which are not covered by a 
VBC (i.e. whose telegrams will not be ignored by the on -board) at a certain moment in 
time> ”. Therefore when, for migration purposes, more than one instance of balises with 
the same internal number but with different VBC markers are used in a cluster of balises, 
the number of balises inside the group that is indicated in each balise telegram shou ld

A.3.4 Handling of Accepted and Stored Information in specific 
Situations  
A.3.4.1  Introduction  
A.3.4.1.1  All data that can be stored onboard after being accepted may be influenced in special 
situations.  
A.3.4.1.2  The situations acting on the “status” of stored information are:  
a) the acceptance  of a conditional emergency stop (3.10.2.2  b)); 
b) the reception of a shortened MA ( 3.8.5.1.3, 3.8.5.1.4 ); 
c) the stored MA is shorten ed due to a section time -out (3.8.4.2.2);  
d) the SvL is shifted (to the DP if any or to the EOA) due to an overlap time -out 
(3.8.4.4.2) ;  
e) the stored MA is shortened due to an end section time -out (3.8.4.1.2);  
f) a request to shorten  MA is granted by the onboard (3.8.6.2);  
g) inconsistency in a balise group marked as unlinked and the train is at standstill 
(3.16.2.5.2);  
h) a linking reaction led to a service brake and the train is at standstill (3.16.2.6.2) ;  
i) the reaction due to the supervision of the safe radio connect ion led to a service brake 
and the train is at standstill (3.16.3.4.5 b) ;  
j) the train category, axle load  category , loading gauge or traction system  is changed 
and the train is at standstill (3.18.3.7) ;  
k) driver closes the desk during SoM ;  
l) RAMS related supe rvision functions led to a service brake and the train is at standstill 
(3.16.2.7)  
m) inconsistency in a balise group marked as linked and linking consistency is not 
checked  onboard and the train is at standstill (3.16.2.4.4.2)  
n) the Limit of Authority becomes an End of Authority and the on -board considers an 
SvL (3.8.4.3.2)  
o) the safe consist length information acquired from external source becomes 
unavailable (4.4.21.1.12)  
A.3.4.1.3  Depending on the situation, the action shall be one of the following : 
a) data is deleted,

A.3.5 Handling of Actions in Specific Situations  
A.3.5.1  Regards the following actions executed in reference to location based information 
received from trackside, the on -board equipment shall , by exception to the other 
requirements in this document,  ensure that the action related to passing a location is 
neither reverted, nor executed twice  in case of  reverse movement (initiated by driver or 
due to roll -away) and sub -sequent forward movement, or in case of adjustment of train 
position and relocation on passing a  balise group that becomes SO LR, which result in 
a new train position situated in rear of the location which triggered the action : 
• Applying new  National Values (see 3.18.2 .3) 
• Request to acknowledge new l evel on entering the acknowledgement area (see 
5.10.4.1 a)) , actions related to passing the level transition border (see 3.5.3.8 d), 
3.6.5.1.4 f),  5.10.1.5, 5.10.3.3.3, 5.10.3.6.2, 5.10.3.7.5, 5.10.3.10.3 ) 
• Start and stop displaying plain or fixed text mess ages (see 3.12.3 .4.3.1 ) 
• Mode transition due to passing the beginning (see 3.12.4.5 together with 4.6.3 [34], 
[40], [71], [72], [73], [74]) or the end (see 3.12.4.6 together with 4.6.3 [ 75], [76]) of a 
LS/OS mode profile  
• Actions related to  radio infill areas  (see 3.5.4.3 3rd bullet, 3.9.3 .5, 3.9.3.10 a)&b), 
3.9.3.15, 3.9.3.16 ) 
• Actions related to RBC/RBC handover (see 3.5.3.8 f), 3.6.5.1.4 e)&k), 3.11.5.14 2nd 
bullet, 3.15.1 .3.1 b)&c), 3.15.1.3.2, 3.15.1.3.7, 3.15.1.3.8 a), 3.17.2.8 c)&e), 5 .15.1.4 ) 
• Actions related to track condition information with the exception of big metal masses  
and non stopping areas  (see 3.5.3.4 e), 3.5.3.8 g), 3.5.4.4, 3.16.3.4.1.3, 
5.18.2.2,3,5&6, 5.18.3.2,3,4&5, 5.18.5.2&3, 5.18.6.2,3,4&5, 5.18.7.3,4&5,

5.20.5.3,5&6, 5.20.6.2&4, 5.20.7.2&5, 5.20.8.2,5&6)  
• Intentionally deleted  
• Start and stop Track Ahead free  request to driver (see 3.15.5 .2) 
• Intentionally deleted  
• Substitute the supervisi on of the LX start location as temporary  EOA/SvL by the 
inclusion of the LX speed restriction in the MRSP (see 5.16.2 .1, 5.16.3 .2) 
• Start the MA end section timer/overlap timer (see 3.8.4.1.1, 3.8.4.4.1)  
A.3.5.1.1  Note: the fact that an action is not referr ed to in the above list does not mean that the 
action is automatically reverted, but that the other requirements in this document strictly 
apply. For instance:

 • In case the reverse movement or the relocation brings back the max safe antenna 
position in rear of the start location of the big metal mass area, the on -board will stop 
ignoring the alarms which may be triggered by big metal masses (i.e. the clauses 
3.12.1.2.1.2 and 3.12.1.3 apply)  
• In case the reverse movement or the relocation brings back the m in safe front end in 
rear of an unprotected LX end location, the on -board will take again into account the 
LX speed restriction (i.e. 3.13.10.2.8 applies) and display again the unprotected LX 
status (i.e. 5.16.1.5 applies)  
• The transition to TR mode on pass ing the EOA/LOA will never be reverted, even if 
the train moves backwards in rear of the EOA/LOA location. Reason: on purpose, no 
such transition back to FS/OS/LS is specified in sections 4.6.2 and 4.6.3.  
• The transition from CSM to TSM on passing the Indic ation supervision limit will not 
be reverted in case of relocation that brings back the train front end in rear of the 
Indication supervision limit. Reason: it has been specified in that way for obvious 
ergonomic reasons (see 3.13.10.6.1).  
A.3.5.2  A maximu m time Tn (see Subset -036 clause 4.2.9) after  it has received a balise group 
message (i.e. a maximum time Tn after  it has received the last balise telegram of the 
balise group), the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment  shall not consider any action 
related to passing an EOA (only in level 1), an LOA, or a former EOA/LOA located in 
advance of the train position measured at the time of reception of this last telegram, until 
the content of  the message has been taken into account . 
A.3.5.2.1  Example 1: in level 1, the crossing of the EOA/LOA location with the min safe antenna, 
before a new extended MA (received when the min safe antenna was in rear of the 
EOA/LOA) has been processed, will not lead to train trip. In other terms the replacement 
of the EOA/LOA is considered by the on -board as happening before the min safe 
antenna crosses the EOA/LOA location (i.e. preventing that clause 3.13.10. 2.7 applies).  
A.3.5.2.2  Example 2: when the override function is active, the crossing of the former EOA /LOA 
location by the min safe antenna, before a “Stop if in SR” information (received when the 
min safe antenna was in rear of the former EOA /LOA ) has been processed, will not lead 
to the end of the override procedure followed by a train trip due to “Stop if in SR”. In other 
terms, both the deletion of the former EOA /LOA  and the end of override procedure (see 
5.8.3.1.3 and 5.8.4.1 c)) are considered by the on -board as simultaneously happening 
before the min safe antenna crosses the former EOA/LOA location.  
A.3.5.2.3  Example 3: in level 2, the crossing of the LOA location with the min safe front end before 
an immediate level transition order to level NTC or level 0 (received when the min safe 
front end was in rear of the LOA) has been processed, will not lead to  train trip. In other 
terms the deletion of the MA (and therefore the deletion of the LOA) due to the level 
change is considered by the on -board as happening before the min safe front end 
crosses the LOA location (i.e. preventing that clause 3.13.10.2.6 a) applies).

 A.3.6 Deletion of accepted and stored information when used  
A.3.6.1  Standard case  
A.3.6.1.1  When the train moves in the direction of its train orientation, storage capacity occupied 
by trackside information no longer used, i.e., the related on -board functionality has been 
completed, shall be made available immediately.  
A.3.6.1.1.1  Note: The requirement is needed to allow trackside to predict the storage capacity 
available on -board in order to comply with dimensioning rules regards information sto red 
on-board given in Subset 040.  
A.3.6.2 Exception  
A.3.6.2.1  Following information shall remain stored on -board for a distance defined by a fixed value 
in rear of the min safe rear end position of the train:  
• location dependent static speed restrictions , i.e., SSP, ASP, TSR , LX SR, PBD SR 
(see 3.11.2.2) , 
• gradient information,  
• reduced adhesion information received from trackside,  
• Track condition “Big metal masses” , 
• MA Section entry points and their associated Section timer stop locations.  
A.3.6.2.1.1  Note: The above information remains stored for the case of a reverse movement:  
• With the exception of the track condition “Big metal masses”,  the stored information 
allows the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment to calculate speed supervision limits 
after a reverse movement (roll -away, or initiated by the driver) , 
• Track condition “Big metal masses” is needed also for a reverse movement itself to 
avoid any false alarms due to Big metal masses in the track , 
• The MA Section information is needed to apply the  clause 3.8.4.2.4 in case of reverse 
movement in rear of an MA Section timer stop location.  
A.3.6.2.1.2  Note: The distance to intervention of the Roll Away Protection or the Unauthorised 
Direction  Movement Protection  is determined by a National/Default val ue.  This is also 
true for a reverse movement in Post trip mode. However, following an intervention, the 
train will not stop immediately. In order to keep the on -board functionality simple, a fixed 
distance value was chosen to define an unambiguous locatio n in rear of the train where 
the above information is no longer required and the related on -board storage capacity is 
made available again.  
A.3.7  Calculation of the basic deceleration  
A.3.7.1  The brake percentage (λ) shall be converted into two different input parameters:  
λo = λ for calculation of emergency brake deceleration (A_brake_emergency(V))

where λ is the brake percentage defined as part of Train Data.  
A.3.7.2  The calculation of the basic deceleration (A_basic(V)) shall use a common algorithm that 
will be used twice, once for the service brake and once for the emergency brake.  
A.3.7.3  The speed limit for the first step shall be calculated as V_lim = x * λ oy. 
V_lim is the speed limit for the first step in km/h

B = 0.076

polynomials of the th ird order with the following format:  
AD_n = a3_n * λo3 + a2_n * λo2 + a1_n * λo + a0_n  
and with the following values for n (all speed limits in km/h):

to be ignored      if V_lim ≥ 150 
n = 4    valid for V_lim < speed ≤ 180   if 150 < V_lim < 180 
valid for 150 < speed ≤ 180    if V_lim ≤ 150  
to be ignored      if V_lim ≥ 180 
n = 5    valid for  V_lim < speed     if V_lim > 180  
valid for 180 < speed     if V_lim ≤ 180

 A.3.10  Service brake feedback  
A.3.10.1  The purpose of service brake feedback is to reduce the distance between the SBI and 
EBI supervision limits and between the SBI and SBD curves.  
A.3.10.2  The on -board shall consider the service brake feedback as available for use if:  
a) The service brake feedback is implemented, AND  
b) The national value does not inhibit its use.  
A.3.10.3  Two different types of feedback fr om the service brake are specified, main brake pipe 
pressure and brake cylinder pressure. The algorithms below are made for main brake 
pipe pressure. When brake cylinder pressure is used instead this shall be converted into 
a fictive main brake pressure va lue in the following way:  
p = fictive main brake pipe pressure (kPa)  
p_cylinder = brake cylinder pressure (kPa)  
k1 = vehicle dependent constant (set by engineering of ETCS on -board; k1 is normally 
between 2 .0 and 2 .7) 
p =  500  - p_cylinder / k1  
A.3.10.4  The value of T_bs1 and T_bs2 shall be calculated according to the following algorithm 
to take the service brake feedback into account:  
p = current main brake pipe pressure (or fictive main brake pipe pressure calculated in  
A.3.10.3 ) 
p0 = reference pressure when not braking  
p1 = pressure at which the train starts to brake = p0 - 30  
p2 = pressure limit, under which T_bs1 and T_bs2 are locked = p0 - 60  
p3 = pressure at full service brake = p0 - 150  
Q_feedback_ active  = a Boolean stati ng whe ther the feedback function is active, i.e. 
once it has started to reduce T_bs1 and T_bs2  until the ceiling speed monitoring is 
entered . 
Q_Tbslocked = a boolean stating whe ther T_bs1 and T_bs2 have been locked to the 
following values  due to enough mai n brake pipe pressure reduction : 
T_bs1_locked =  0 s.  
T_bs2_locked =  2 s.  
Q_displaylocked_P = a boolean stating whether the displayed permitted speed is 
locked due to SB feedback.  
Q_displaylocked_SBI = a boolean stating whether the displayed SBI speed (if  any) is 
locked due to SB feedback.  
Q_displaylocked_TD = a boolean stating whether the displayed target distance is 
locked due to SB feedback.  
A displayed value is locked from the moment the SB feedback has started to reduce 
T_bs1 and T_bs2 until the calcu lated value becomes less than the displayed and

 possible to release the brakes before a speed reduction, without having the curves 
moving back again. It might though result in emergency b rake intervention if the driver 
releases the brakes too early. But since EBI is not moved, this is not a safety issue. To

thus may avoid emergency brake.

 A.3.12  Calculation of reduced values of safe brake build up time and 
expected brake build up time  
A.3.12.1  Introduction  
A.3.12.1.1  Modelling the brake build up effort using a ramp function rather than a step function 
allows to predict that a certain deceleration development may be enough to safely reach 
a target wi th only a portion of the equivalent brake build up time elapsed.  
A.3.12.1.2  This section defines how the safe brake build up time and expected brake build up times 
can be reduced to take profit of such effect.  
A.3.12.1.3  This computation is done for each t arget according to the following seven steps:  
a) Determination of the inputs for the computation;  
b) Extrapolation of the train speed development over the brake reaction time, to check 
whether this extrapolated speed is above the target speed at this time;  
c) Extrapolation of the train speed development over the full brake build up time along 
the ramp model;  
d) Computation of the time at which the target speed is reached along the ramp model, 
for the targets whose speed is higher than this train speed extrapolated  as per bullet 
c); 
e) Computation of the corresponding travelled distances;  
f) Conversion of these travelled distances into reduced values of safe and expected 
(equivalent) brake build up times that are to be used in the formulas to derive the 
EBI/SBI supervisio n limits;  
g) Selection of the highest reduced values of safe and expected (equivalent) brake build 
up times amongst the ones ensuring equivalent speed reduction and the ones 
ensuring equivalent travelled distance.  
A.3.12.1.4  Exception: in case the conversion model is used and 𝐾𝑡_𝑖𝑛𝑡=0, the rest of section A.3.12 
does not apply for 𝑇𝑏𝑒_𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑒𝑑  determination and 𝑇𝑏𝑒_𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑒𝑑  shall be set to 𝑇𝑏𝑒. 
A.3.12.1.5  Exception: if 𝑇𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛≥𝑇𝑏𝑒, the rest of section A.3.12 does not app ly for 𝑇𝑏𝑒_𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑒𝑑  
determination and 𝑇𝑏𝑒_𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑒𝑑  shall be set to 𝑇𝑏𝑒. 
A.3.12.2   Inputs for the computation (brake build up times reduction)  
A.3.12.2.1  The delays when full brake forces are reached, 𝑡2𝑏𝑒 and 𝑡2𝑏𝑠, shall be compu ted as 
follows:

A.3.12.8.2  Note: the limitation at 𝑇𝑏𝑒 and 𝑇𝑏𝑠 values is needed because of the safe -side 
approximations done on the brake models in the computation defined in the present 
section.  
A.3.12.9  Informative annex: derivation of the formulas  
A.3.12.9.1  The purpose of this part is to explain how the formulas given in the rest of section A.3.12 
have been obtained. The explanation is based on the emergency brake related formulas, 
A.3.12.7.17 explains how these can be modified to obtain service brake related formulas.  
A.3.12.9.2  About A.3.12.3&4:  For these calcul ations, it is assumed (refer to figure 45 and 
3.13.9.3.2) that once the emergency brake command is triggered, the train speed 
(compensated for the speed measurement inaccuracy 𝑉𝑑𝑒𝑙𝑡𝑎0) increases with 𝐴𝑒𝑠𝑡1 
acceleration up to 𝑇𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 _𝑚𝑎𝑥 time and then with 𝐴𝑒𝑠𝑡2 acceleration. This speed 
increase is compensated by the 𝐴𝐸𝐵 deceleration coming from the brake force as per the 
ramp model from 𝑇𝑏𝑒_𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑐𝑡 to 𝑡2𝑏𝑒 (refer to Figure 31). The average deceleration coming 
from the  brake force is half of its final (full) value.

A.3.12.9.4  About A.3.12.5:  The speed computed at 𝑡2𝑏𝑒 in A.3.12.4 can be computed for any time 
𝑡 between MAX( 𝑇𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 _𝑚𝑎𝑥 , 𝑇𝑏𝑒_𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑐𝑡) and 𝑡2𝑏𝑒 by using the following substitution 
𝑡2𝑏𝑒=𝑡 in A.3.12.9.3 formulas, which give the following final formula:  
𝑣(𝑡)=MAX(0 ,𝑉𝑒𝑠𝑡+𝑉𝑑𝑒𝑙𝑡𝑎0+𝐴𝑒𝑠𝑡1∙𝑇𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 _𝑚𝑎𝑥+𝐴𝑒𝑠𝑡2∙(𝑡−𝑇𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 _𝑚𝑎𝑥) 
−𝐴𝐸𝐵∙(𝑡−𝑇𝑏𝑒_𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑐𝑡)² 
2∙(𝑡2𝑏𝑒−𝑇𝑏𝑒_𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑐𝑡)) 
A.3.12.9.5  The above formula can be used to express an unknown time (𝑡−𝑇𝑏𝑒_𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑐𝑡) to get the 
final time 𝑡=𝑡2𝑏𝑒_𝑒𝑛𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ that corresponds to the wanted final speed (𝑉𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡+
𝑑𝑉𝑒𝑏𝑖(𝑉𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡)). Doing so, this quadratic form from which (𝑡−𝑇𝑏𝑒_𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑐𝑡) or 𝑡=𝑡2𝑏𝑒_𝑒𝑛𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ 
finally, can be obtained by solvi ng:

A.3.12.9.7  The value of 𝐷𝑡2𝑏𝑒_𝑒𝑛𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ is the value of 𝑑_𝑟𝑎𝑚𝑝(𝑡2𝑏𝑒_𝑒𝑛𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ). It must be noticed that after 
having travelled this distance, the wanted final speed is reached, i.e. no distance is to be 
travelled over the EBD curve.  
A.3.12.9.8  About A.3.12.7:  Because the model that is  used in section 3.13 is a step model, we 
need to find which (artificial) value of 𝑇𝑏𝑒 (𝑡𝑏𝑒_𝑒𝑛𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ_𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑝_𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡, here called 𝑡𝑏𝑒_𝑒𝑛) would 
lead to obtaining the same travelled distance 𝐷𝑡2𝑏𝑒_𝑒𝑛𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ. In contrast to the use of t he 
ramp model, a section of the EBD curve is needed here, between this sought time 𝑡𝑏𝑒_𝑒𝑛 
and the time the wanted final speed 𝑉𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡 , here called 𝑉𝑇) is reached . 
A.3.12.9.9  First, we need an expression of 𝑑_𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑝(𝑡𝑏𝑒_𝑒𝑛):

−𝐴𝑒𝑠𝑡2 is always < 0, t he valid solution of the 
quadratic equation is derived from the positive sign in front of the square root . 
A.3.12.9.17  About A.3.12.8:  This value 𝑡𝑏𝑒_𝑒𝑛, i.e. 𝑡𝑏𝑒_𝑒𝑛𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ_𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑝_𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡, ensures that the distance 
travelled along the step model (supporting section 3.13 formulas) is equivalent to the one 
computed along the ramp model. However, it does not ensure that the speed reduction 
is equivalent along both models.  
A.3.12.9.18  Therefore, an equivalent brake build up time 𝑡𝑏𝑒_𝑒𝑛𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ_𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑝_𝑑𝑒𝑙𝑡𝑎𝑉  computed from 
𝑡2𝑏𝑒_𝑒𝑛𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ is used as a lower limit to the final 𝑇𝑏𝑒_𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑒𝑑  value. Its computation is similar 
to the one defined by clause 3.13.2.2.3.2.4:  
𝑡𝑏𝑒_𝑒𝑛𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ_𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑝_𝑑𝑒𝑙𝑡𝑎𝑉 =𝑇𝑏𝑒_𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑐𝑡+𝑡2𝑏𝑒_𝑒𝑛𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ−𝑇𝑏𝑒_𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑐𝑡

making the following substitutions: 𝑉𝑡2𝑏𝑒=𝑉𝑡2𝑏𝑠 ; 𝑇𝑏𝑒_𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑐𝑡=𝑇𝑏𝑠_𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑐𝑡 ; 𝑡2𝑏𝑒=𝑡2𝑏𝑠 ; 𝐴𝐸𝐵=

A.3.13  Inhibition of increase of displayed permitted speed and SBI 
speed  
A.3.13.1  This appendix specifies under which conditions the displayed permitted speed and SBI 
speed are locked in order to avoid their increase which could be caused by active 
reduction of brake build up times (see Appendix A.3.12) . 
A.3.13.2  The boolean stating whether the displayed permitted speed and SBI speed are not 
allowed to increase (Q_display_pawl) shall be calculated according to the following 
algorithm:  
If on-board is in  target speed monitoring or release speed monitoring then  
If the MRDT changes then  
Q_display_pawl = false  
Else if T_be_reduced computed for any target is lower than T_be then  
Q_display_pawl = true  
Else if the service brake command is available for use, t he service brake 
feedback is not available for use, and T_bs_reduced computed for any 
target is lower than T_bs then  
Q_display_pawl = true

 4.4.6  SLEEPING  
4.4.6.1  Description  
4.4.6.1.1  The Sleeping mode is defined to manage the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment of a 
slave engine that is remote control led. 
4.4.6.1.2  The desk (s) of a sleeping engine must be closed (since there is no driver, no information 
shall be shown).  
4.4.6.1.3  As the engine is remote controlled by the leading engine, its ERTMS/ETCS on -board 
equipment shall not perform any train movement supervision.  
4.4.6.1.4  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall perform the Train Position function; in 
particular, the front/rear end of the engine (i.e., not the train) shall be used to refer to 
train front/rear end.  
4.4.6.1.5  Sleeping mode shall be automatically detected on -board via the train interface.  
4.4.6.1.6  If possible, the train must not be stopped due to a safety critical fault in a sleeping engine. 
The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment sh ould therefore try to memorise the occurrence 
of such fault(s), which sh ould be handled when the engine leaves the Sleeping mode. 
The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment sh ould also try to send an error information to 
the RBC.  
4.4.6.1.7  If a desk of the sleeping engine is ope ned while the train is running (this is an abnormal 
operation), the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall switch to Stand -By mode.  
4.4.6.1.8  If the sleeping input information  is set to "sleeping not requested " (no more detection of 
the remote control), the switch to S tand-By mode shall be made only if the train is at 
standstill.  
4.4.6.1.9  Intentionally deleted . 
4.4.6.1.10  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall open a communication session with the 
RBC when at least one of the following events occur s: 
a) in all levels, on receipt of the order  to establish a communication session with  the 
RBC.  
b) In level 2, when entering or exiting Sleeping mode (to report the change of mode to 
the RBC).  
c) In level 2, when a safety critical fault of the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment occurs 
(to report the fault to t he RBC).  
4.4.6.1.11  Intentionally deleted . 
4.4.6.1.12  In case of balise group message consistency error (refer to 3.16.2.4.4 and 3.16.2.5.1), 
the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment shall not command the service brake.

 4.4.7  STAND BY  
4.4.7.1  Description  
4.4.7.1.1  The Stand -By mode is a default mode and can not be selected by the driver.  
4.4.7.1.2  It is in the Stand -By mode that the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment awakes.  
4.4.7.1.3  Data for mission are collected in Stand -By (see SRS -chapter 5: “Start of Mission” 
procedure).  
4.4.7.1.4  In Stand -By mode, the desk of the engine can be open or c losed. No interaction with the 
driver shall be possible as long as the desk is closed, except isolation of the 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment . 
4.4.7.1.5  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall perform the Standstill Supervision , in order 
to prevent the train from moving . 
4.4.7.1.5.1  As soon as  a movement is detected, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board shall start supervising 
(see section 3.6.7) whether the train travels away, from the location when the movement 
was detected, over a distance longer than a distance specified by the National Value.  In 
case this distance is exceeded, the brake command shall be triggered.  
4.4.7.1.5.2  Refer to section 3.14.1 for the revocation of the brake command.  
4.4.7.1.5.3  After revocation of the brake command , the Standstill Supervision shall be re -initialised , 
i.e. the cl ause 4.4.7.1.5.1 shall be applied again . 
4.4.7.1.5.4  If a desk is open, an indication shall be given to the driver showing when the Standstill 
Supervision is commanding the brakes.  
4.4.7.1.6  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall perform the Train Position function; in 
particu lar, the front/rear end of the engine shall be used to refer to train front/rear end 
and no train integrity information shall be reported to the RBC, with the following 
exceptions:  
a) If valid Train Data is available, the Train Data “train length” can be used  to report train 
integrity information in case other preconditions are fulfilled (see chapter 3 Table 2 c 
for details), OR  
b) If no valid Train Data is available but the safe consist length information is available, 
the train front/rear is determined as per cl auses 3.6.1.3. 4 and 3.18.3.2.4 and train 
integrity information can be reported to the RBC in case other preconditions are 
fulfilled (see chapter 3 Table 2 c for details).

4.4.8.1.5  While the ERTMS/ETCS on -board is  in Shunting mode, the reception of level transition  
orders has no immediate effec t. The level transition announcements shall be rejected 
and, upon reception of the order while already in Shunting mode , an immediate level 
transition order or a conditional level transition order shall be stored but evaluated only 
when another mode than Shunting or Passive Shunting has been entered  (i.e. when the 
Shunting movement is terminated) .

 4.4.11  STAFF RESPONSIBLE  
4.4.11.1  Description  
4.4.11.1.1  The Staff Responsible mode allows the driver to move the train under his own 
responsibility in an ERTMS/ETCS equipped area.  
4.4.11.1.2  This mode is used when the system does not know the route. For  example:  
a) After the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment starts -up (awakening of the train).  
b) To pass a signal at danger / override an EOA.  
c) After a trackside failure (for example: loss of radio contact).  
4.4.11.1.3  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall supervise train move ments against:  
a) a ceiling speed: the staff responsible mode speed limit  
b) a given distance (regarding its supervision starting time/start  location see 
4.4.11.1.3.1) . The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall supervise braking curves 
with a target speed of zero to the end of this distance. If the train overpasses this 
distance (see next note) the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall trip the train  
c) a list of expected balise  group s, if this list has been sent by the RBC. The train shall 
be tripped if overpassin g a balise group that is not in the list. (When an empty list is 
sent, no balise group can be passed. When no list is sent, all balise groups can be 
passed)  
d) balise groups giving the order ‘stop if in SR’. This order shall immediately trip the train , 
unless the overpassed balise group is included in a list of expected balises as defined 
in item c)  
e) running in the direction opposite to the train orientation ( Unauthorised Direction  
Movement Protection)  
4.4.11.1.3.1  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board shall supervise  the SR distan ce as follows:  
a) If the National/Default Value determines the max permitted distance to run in SR 
mode, the calculation of the remaining  distance from the virtual train position to the 
end of the SR distance (see section 3.6.7) shall be based on a supervisio n starting  
when SR mode is entered, or, already in Staff Responsible mode, when Override is 
activated.  
b) If the max permitted distance to run in SR mode is determined by the value transmitted 
by the RBC, or entered by the driver, the calcula tion of the remai ning distance from 
the virtual train position to the end of the SR distance (see section 3.6.7) shall be 
based on a supervision starting  when the distance information is received or entered.  
c) If the max permitted distance to run in SR mode is determined by the value transmitted 
by Euroloop , the distance information transmitted by E uroloop  shall be referred to one 
or more reference balise groups. On -board shall evaluate the distance to run in SR 
mode by matching the reference balise groups given with the LRBG .

4.4.11.1.3.1.1  Note: the end of the SR distance determined from Euroloop, which is originally 
referred to the LRBG at the time of the reception of the Euroloop information, can be 
afterwards relocated to the SOLR that is different from any of the original reference ba lise 
groups transmitted by Euroloop.  
4.4.11.1.4  Note:  Since the gradient profile may not be available , the supervision of the braking 
curves in Staff Responsible mode does not ensure that the train will not pass the given 
distance.  
4.4.11.1.5  The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment s hall give the possibility to the driver to modify 
the value of the SR mode speed limit and of the given distance. This shall be possible 
only at standstill.  
4.4.11.1.5.1  If a train movement is detected while the driver is entering the SR speed/distance 
limits, the ERTM S/ETCS on -board equipment shall trigger the brake command.  
4.4.11.1.5.2  The unit, range and resolution of the SR mode speed limit and distance entered by 
the driver shall be as specified in A.3.11.  
4.4.11.1.6  If the level is 2 and a communication session is open , the driver shall have the possibility 
to request a new distance to run in Staff Responsible , by selecting "Start". This trigger s 
an MA request.  
4.4.11.1.6.1  Note: Once the SR distance is covered, the driver may have to go further.  
4.4.11.1.6.2  When entering SR mode , the value applicable for SR mode speed  limit and the value 
applicable for SR distance shall be the corresponding National/Default value s. Exception 
for SR distance: SR mode is authorised by RBC giving an SR distance.  
4.4.11.1.6.3  While in SR mode , the value applicable for the SR mode speed limit shall be, if 
available, the last value entered by the driver.  
4.4.11.1.6.4  While in SR mode, the value applicable for the SR distance shall be, if available, the 
last value received by the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment  amongst:  
a) the distance to run in SR entered by the driver;  
b) the distance to run in SR given by trackside . 
4.4.11.1.6.5  When "Override" is selected , the SR mode s peed  limit value and the SR distance 
value previously entered by driver or given by trackside, if any, shall be deleted. The 
corresponding National/Default value s shall enter in force.  
4.4.11.1.6.6  If the train is in SR and receives a new distance to run in SR mode from the RBC, the 
stored list of expected balise groups, if any, shall be deleted or shall be replaced by the 
list of expected balise groups sent together with the distance to run in SR.

4.4.15.1.1  The Non -Leading mode is defined to manage the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment of 
a slave engine that is NOT electrically coupled to the leading engine (and so, not remote 
controlled) but has its own driver.  
4.4.15.1.1.1  Note: This operating situation is called Tandem.  
4.4.15.1.1.2  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall use, as a necessary condition to enter 
in Non -Leading mode, a non -leading input information  from the train interface.  
4.4.15.1.1.3  Upon t he detection that  the non -leading input information  is set to "Non -leading not 
permitted" , the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall inform the driver that the non -
leading operation is no longer permitted and shall request an acknowledgement from the 
driver.  However, the switch to Stand -By mode shall be made only if the train is at 
standstill.  
4.4.15.1.2  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall not perform any train movement 
supervision in Non -Leading mode.  
4.4.15.1.3  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall perform the Train Position function; in 
particular, the front/rear end of the engine (i.e., not the train) shall be used to refer to 
train front/rear end  and no train integrity information shall be reported to the RBC, 
regardless of whether the train integrity and/or the safe con sist length  information is 
available on -board . 
4.4.15.1.4  When level is 2, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall report its position to the 
RBC, according to the previously received parameters.  
4.4.15.1.5  If possible, the train must not be stopped due to a safety critical fau lt in a non -leading 
engine. The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment sh ould therefore try to memorise the 
occurrence of such fault(s), which sh ould be handled when the engine leaves Non 
Leading mode. The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment sh ould also try to send an er ror

4.4.16.1  Description  
4.4.16.1.1   If it is interfaced to an ERTMS/ATO on -board and if t he ATO selector is in position "On", 
the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment is in Automatic Driving mode when the 
ERTMS/ATO on -board drives the train according to a journey profile provided by the 
ERTMS/ATO trackside.  
4.4.16.1.2   The Automatic D riving mode can only be entered upon a driver action, i.e. selecting "ATO 
engage" when all necessary conditio ns are fulfilled  (see SUBSET -125 for details) . 
4.4.16.1.3   Once in Automatic  Driving  mode, the driver can at any time take back the control of the 
train drivi ng by acting on the brakes or by selecting "ATO disengage" . 
4.4.16.1.4   The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall supervise train movements in the same 
way as in Full Supervision mode, except that for the speed and distance target speed 
monitoring  when an SBI supervisi on limit  is exceeded  neither a brake  command nor the 
intervention status shall be triggered . 
4.4.16.1.5   The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall display the train speed, the permitted 
speed  and the SBI speed (whenever the ERTMS/ATO on -board drives over the 
permitted speed) to the driver (this list is not exhaustive – refer to chapter  4.7 “DMI

 4.4.18  REVERSING  
4.4.18.1  Description  
4.4.18.1.1  The Reversing mode allows the driver to change the direction of movement of the train 
and drive from the same cab, i.e. the train orientation remains unchanged. This is 
possible only in areas so marked by tracksi de. 
4.4.18.1.2  Note: This mode is used to allow the train to escape from a dangerous situation and to 
reach as fast as possible a “safer” location.  
4.4.18.1.3  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall supervise train movements against:  
a) a ceiling speed : the Reversing mode speed limit given from trackside  
b) a distance to run in the direction opposite to the train orientation , given from trackside. 
The emergency brake shall be commanded if overpassing this distance  
4.4.18.1.4  After the release of a brake command initiat ed due to an overpassed reversing distance, 
and while the reversing distance is still overpassed, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 
equipment shall command the emergency brake for any further movement in the 
direction opposite to the train orientation.  
4.4.18.1.5  The ERTMS/ETC S on -board equipment shall display the train speed, the permitted 
speed and  the remaining distance to run . 
4.4.18.1.6  In case the SBI supervision limit is exceeded (refer to chapter 3  table 5, triggering 
condition t4), the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall command the emergency 
brake  instead of the service brake . For the revocation of the brake command, refer to 
3.13.10.2.4.  
4.4.18.1.7  The position reports sent when in reversing mode shall refer to the location of the driving 
cab (as before reversing).  
4.4.18.1.8  The ERTMS/ETCS onboard e quipment shall perform the Unauthorised Direction  
Movement Protection . As in RV mode, the allowed movement is a reverse movement , 
then the Unauthorised Direction  Movement Protection avoids the train running in forward 
direction.  
4.4.18.1.9  Intentionally deleted . 
4.4.18.1.10  In case of balise group message consistency error (refer to 3.16.2.4.4 and 3.16.2.5.1), 
the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment shall not command the service brake.  
4.4.18.1.11  In case there is an alarm reporting a malfunction for the onboard balise transmission 
function, the ER TMS/ETCS onboard equipment shall ignore this alarm.  
4.4.18.1.12  In case the ERTMS/ETCS system version number X transmitted by any balise is greater 
than the highest version X supported by the onboard equipment (refer to 3.17.3.5), the 
information from this balise shal l be ignored, the train shall not be tripped and the driver 
shall not be informed.

4.4.19.1  Description  
4.4.19.1.1  The Limited  Supervision mode enables the train to be operated in areas where trackside 
information can be supplied to realise background supervision of the train.  
4.4.19.1.2  Limited supervision can not be selected by the driver, but shall be entered automatically 
when commanded  by trackside and all necessary conditions are fulfilled.  
4.4.19.1.3  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall supervise train movements against a 
dynamic speed profile.  
4.4.19.1.4  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall display the train speed  and the release 
speed, if any (this  list is not exhaustive – refer to chapter 4.7 “DMI depending on modes”). 
Upon request by trackside (refer to clauses 4.4.19.1.4.2 to 4.4.19.1.4.6) if the generic LS 
function marker is stored on -board or if the conditions in clause 4.4.19.1.4.7 are fulfill ed, 
the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall also display the lowest speed amongst:  
a) the lowest MRSP element between the minimum safe front end of the train and the 
EOA/LOA, AND  
b) the target speed at the EOA/LOA  
4.4.19.1.4.1  The speed resulting from 4.4.19.1.4 a) and b) is called the Lowest Supervised Speed 
within the Movement Authority (LSSMA)  
4.4.19.1.4.2  Upon an order to toggle on the LSSMA display, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 
equipment shall start a delay timer:  
a) For order received from RBC/RIU: at the value of the time stamp of the me ssage 
including the order.  
b) For order received from balise group: at the time of passage over the first encountered 
balise of the balise group giving the order.  
c) Exception to a) and b): for order that has been stored in the level transition buffer (see 
section 4.8.3): at the time the level transition is performed.  
4.4.19.1.4.3  When the delay timer value becomes greater than the time -out value given by 
trackside, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall display the LSSMA.  
4.4.19.1.4.4  On reception of an order to toggle (on or off) the L SSMA display, a toggle on order 
which has not been executed yet (because the on -board delay timer has not reached the

leads immediately to the display of the LSSMA as per clauses 4.4.19.1.4.2 and 
4.4.19.1.4.3.  
4.4.19.1.4.7  If the generic LS function marker is not  stored on -board, the clauses 4.4.19.1.4.2 to 
4.4.19.1.4.6 shall not apply and the LSSMA shall be displayed if:  
a) the target speed at the EOA/LOA is lower than the Limited Supervision mode speed 
limit, AND  
b) the LSSMA is lower than the maximum train speed.  
4.4.19.1.4.8  The generic LS function marker shall be deleted by the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 
equipment as soon as a Limited Supervision mode profile is received without it in the 
same balise group message.  
4.4.19.1.5  If receiving a "track ahead free" request from the RBC, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board 
equipment requests the driver to enter the "track ahead free" information.

4.4.19.3.1.1  Note: The Li mited Supervision mode enables the train to be operated in areas 
equipped with lineside signals where ETCS does not have information regarding the 
status of some signals, i.e. not all signals are fitted with LEUs or connected to an RBC . 
4.4.19.3.2  The driver must always observe the existing line -side information (signals, speed boards 
etc.) and National operating rules.  
4.4.19.3.2.1  Note: the indications given to the driver by the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment do 
not substitute the observance of the line -side information. In parti cular the display of the 
LSSMA, if deemed necessary by the trackside, only complements the line -side 
information, e.g. in case there could be a discrepancy between this latter and the 
background supervision.

 4.4.20  PASSIVE  SHUNTING  
4.4.20.1  Description  
4.4.20.1.1  The Passive Shunting mode is defined to manage the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 
equipment of a slave engine (NOT remote controlled, but mechanically coupled to the 
leading engine), being part of a shunting consist. This mode can also be used to carry 
on a shunting movement wit h a s ingle engine fitted with one on -board equipment and 
two cabs, when the driver has to change the driving cab . 
4.4.20.1.2  The desk of a Passive Shunting engine must be closed (since there is no driver, no 
information shall be shown).  
4.4.20.1.3  As the engine is coupled to a leading engine, its ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall 
not perform any train movement supervision.  
4.4.20.1.4  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall perform Train Position function; in 
particular, the front/rear end of the engine (i.e., not the train) shall be used  to refer to 
train front/rear end.  
4.4.20.1.5  It shall only be possible to enter in Passive Shunting mode from the Shunting mode; 
while in Shunting mode, the driver shall have the possibility to enable the function 
“Continue Shunting on desk closure” . 
4.4.20.1.6  When the active  desk is closed, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall switch to 
Passive Shunting mode  if the function “Continue Shunting on desk closure” is active and 
the passive shunting input information  is set to "Passive shunting permitted" on  the train 
interface. If the function “Continue Shunting on desk closure” is not active or the passive 
shunting input information  is set to "Passive shunting not permitted ", the ERTMS/ETCS 
on-board equipment shall switch to Stand -By mode instead.  
4.4.20.1.7  The speci al function “Continue Shunting on desk closure” shall allow one and only one 
transition from Shunting mode to Passive Shunting mode. The special function shall be 
inactive once the Shunting mode is left.  
4.4.20.1.8  If a desk of the Passive Shunting engine is opened  and no “Stop Shunting on desk 
opening” information previously received from balise group is stored onboard , the 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall switch to Shunting mode.  
4.4.20.1.9  If a desk of the Passive Shunting engine is opened and “Stop Shunting on desk openin g” 
information previously received from balise group is stored onboard, the ERTMS/ETCS 
on-board equipment shall switch to Stand By mode.  
4.4.20.1.10  If possible, the train must not be stopped due to a safety critical fault in a Passive 
Shunting engine. The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment sh ould therefore try to 
memorise the occurrence of such fault(s), which sh ould be handled when the engine 
leaves the Passive Shunting mode.  
4.4.20.1.11  While the ERTMS/ETCS on -board is  in Passive Shunting mode, the reception of level 
transition  orders has  no immediate effect . The level transition announcements shall be

 4.4.21  SUPERVISED MANOEUVRE  
4.4.21.1   Description  
4.4.21.1.1  The purpose of the Supervised Manoeuvre mode is to enable an enhanced supervision 
of shunting movements similar to the Full Supervision mode, while the cab is not 
necessarily at the front of the shunting consist.  
4.4.21.1.2  The Supervised Manoeuvre mode can only be entered upon the reception of an 
authorisation from the RBC, which is preceded by a driver action (i.e. at standstill 
selecting "Supervised Manoeuvre").  
4.4.21.1.3  The selection of "Supervised Manoeuvre" by the driver shall only be possible if the “safe 
consist length” information is available on -board.  
4.4.21.1.4  However, the Supervised Manoeuvre mode does not require that the Train Data set as 
listed in 3.18.3.2, which would fully correspond to the composition of the shunting consist, 
is captured by the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment. With the exception of 3.18.3.2 b), 
preconfigured default Train Data shall be used by the on -board.  
4.4.21.1.5  To be in Supervised Manoeuvre mode, SSP and gradient are not required for the whole 
length of the consist, but shall be at least available from the front end of the consist.  
4.4.21.1.6  Once in Supervised Manoeuvre mode, if SSP and gradient are not known for the whole 
length of the consist, an indication “EN TERING SM” shall be clearly displayed to the 
driver until SSP and grad ient are known for the whole length of the consist.  
4.4.21.1.6.1  Note: this indication may also be displayed in case the safe consist length information 
has been changed.  
4.4.21.1.7   The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall perform the Train Position function, taking 
into account the clause s 3.6.1.3. 4, 3.6.1.5.1 , 3.6.4. 1.5, 3.18.3.2.4  and the Train Data 
“safe consist length”. In case, upon reception of a Supervised Manoeuvre authorisation, 
the direction of its Movement Authority is opposite to the current train orientation, the 
following shall apply:  
a) The new estimated train front end shall be obtained by shifting the current one in  
direction of the new authorisation, with a distance equal to the sum of the nominal 
consist lengths in front of and in rear of the engine respectively.  
b) The new min safe front end shall be obtained by shifting the current max safe front 
end in direction of the new authorisation, with a distance equal to the sum of:  
• the max safe consist length in front of the engine and the min safe consist length 
in rear of  the engine, if the train orientation was the same as the active cab, or  
• the max safe consist length in rear of the engine and the min safe consist length 
in front of the engine, if the train orientation was opposite to the active cab.  
c) The new max safe fro nt end shall be obtained by shifting the current min safe front 
end in direction of the new authorisation, with a distance equal to the sum of :

• the min safe consist length in rear of the engine and the max safe consist length 
in front of the engine, if the train orientation was opposite to the active cab  
4.4.21.1.8   The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall  supervise train movements against a 
dynamic speed profile.  
4.4.21.1.9   The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall display the train speed, the permitted 
speed, the target distance, and the target speed to the driver (this list is not exhaustive 
– refer to chapter 4.7 “ DMI depending on modes”). The ERTMS/ETCS on -board 
equipment shall also indicate whether a movement of the train corresponding to the 
direction of the Supervised Manoeuvre Movement Authority is obtained through traction 
applied with the direction controller  in position forward or backward . 
4.4.21.1.10   At standstill, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall give the possibility to the driver 
to request a new Supervised Manoeuvre authorisation (e.g. in case of zig -zag 
movements when the end of a Movement Authority is reac hed).  
4.4.21.1.11   While the ERTMS/ETCS on -board is in Supervised Manoeuvre mode, the reception of 
level transitions orders has no immediate effect. The level transition announcements 
shall be rejected and, upon reception of the order while already in Supervised Manoe uvre 
mode, an immediate level transition order or a conditional level transition order shall be 
stored but evaluated only when another mode than Supervised Manoeuvre or Shunting 
has been entered  (i.e. when the Supervised Manoeuvre movement , possibly follow ed by 
a Shunting one , is terminated).  
4.4.21.1.11.1  Note: in case the Supervised Manoeuvre movement is terminated through a direct 
transition to No Power mode, see clause 4.11.1.4 . 
4.4.21.1.12   If the safe consist length information is acquired from an external source and it become s 
unavailable , the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall inform the driver and the 
trackside and, if the train is not at standstill, it shall command the service brake. The 
location based information stored on -board shall be shortened to the current position  
either immediately or, if the train was not at standstill, only when it has reached standstill. 
Refer to appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of information, which shall be shortened . 
4.4.21.1.13   The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall generate the information to the train

 4.5 Modes and on-board  functions  
4.5.1  Introduction  
4.5.1.1  The following table specifies for each  mode , which  on-board functions are active or not , 
when it cannot be derived from the specific provisions of the mode itself (see § 4.4), from 
the mode transi tions (see § 4.6), from the display of information according to the mode 
(see §4.7), from the acceptance criteria of trackside information according to the level 
and mode (see §4.8), from the handling of accepted and stored information upon a mode 
transiti on (see §4.10 and 4.11) and from any other explicit mode specific provision in the 
specifications . The term “ function ” in this section must be understood a s an individual 
clause classified as on -board requirement or definition, or as a group of clauses 
classified as on -board requirement or definition, which is/ are referred to  in the “Related 
SRS §” (second column of the table).  
4.5.1.2  Note:  This table must be understood as a complement to all other SRS chapters.  
Conversely when a clause is not referred to in this table, it means that there are no 
additional requirements on the applicability of the clause depending on the mode to the 
ones, if any, that can be found in the rest of the SRS.  
4.5.1.3  Note:  for DMI depending on modes, refer to §4.7.  
4.5.1.4  Unless stated otherwise, the clauses not referred to in this table shall not be applicable 
in NP mode.  
4.5.1.5  With the exception of the clauses stipulated in the sections 4.4.3 and 4.4.5 respectively, 
the applicability of any other clause of the SRS is irrelevant in modes IS and SF.  
4.5.2  Active F unctions Table  
4.5.2.1  X = functions shall be active , i.e. their corresponding on -board requirements and/or 
definitions shall apply  
Empty case = function s shall be inactive , i.e. their corresponding on -board 
requirements and/or definitions shall not apply  
NR = Not  Relevant: This concerns the modes SF and IS in which the on -board 
behaviour cannot be harmonised  
 
4.5.2.2  Whenever a section number is referred to in the second column of the table, it means 
that all the clauses classified as on -board requirement belonging to thi s section are 
applicable/not applicable for the concerned mode, depending whether the corresponding 
function is marked as active/not active.

 4.6 Transitions between modes  
4.6.1  Symbols  
4.6.1.1  The indication “ 4>” means: The condition n°4 must be fulfilled to trigger the transition  
4.6.1.2  From the mode located in the column  
4.6.1.3  To the mode that is indicated by the arrow “ >”. 
4.6.1.4  Each transition from a given mode receives a priority order (indicated by “ -px-”, x is the 
priority order) to avoid a conflict between the different transitions when they occur at the 
same time (i.e. in the same clock cycle). P1 has a higher priority than P2.  
4.6.1.5  Some transitions have received the same p riority order. This has been decided when it 
is obvious that these transitions cannot occur at the same time, and so can never lead 
to a conflicting situation (for example, the RBC cannot give in the same time a MA for FS 
and a MA for OS to a given engine,  this is why the transition “from SR to FS” and the 
transition “from SR to OS” have the same priority order).  
4.6.1.6  "16, 17, 18" means "16 or 17 or 18".

 4.7 DMI depending on modes  
4.7.1  Introduction  
4.7.1.1  The DMI is an interface  that allows the direct exchange of information between the driver 
and the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment.  The indirect exchange of information done 
via the train interface (e.g. a driver’s action on the service brake used for the service 
brake feedback, opening/closing the desk) is not part of the DMI.  
4.7.1.2  The device(s) used to select “ERTMS/ETC S onboard equipment powered/unpowered” 
is (are) not part of the DMI . 
4.7.1.3  The device(s) used to select /indicate  “ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment isolated/not 
isolated” is (are) part of the DMI . 
4.7.1.4  Intentionally deleted . 
4.7.1.5  Information (input or output) only relevant for  National System  and not originated by the 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board is not included in the following section.  
4.7.2  DMI versus Mode Table  
4.7.2.1.1  X = active: For a  DMI output, this means that the output information shall be shown to 
the driver when the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equ ipment is in the mode indicated in the 
column. For a  DMI input, this means that it shall be possible for the driver to enter this 
information when the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment is in the mode indicated in the 
column).  
4.7.2.1.2  A = available: This means that the input/output shall become active ONLY if another 
condition(s) is (are) fulfilled. This condition(s) are not described here.  
4.7.2.1.3  Grey cells: availability and meaning defined by national system.  
4.7.2.1.4  NA = Not Applicable: This concer ns the modes SF and IS in which the DMI inputs and 
outputs cannot be determined.

 4.8 Acceptance of received information  
4.8.1  Introduction  
4.8.1.1  The aim of this chapter is to give an overview o f which information is accepted  or rejected 
depending on the state of the on -board (level, mode) , the origin  of the received 
information ( from RBC or not) , and in case of information not transmitted by an RBC the  
type of information (infill or non -infill). 
4.8.1.2  The following sections have to be interpreted by applying the filters as shown in Figure 
3. The first filter is detailed in section 4.8.3 “Accepted information depending on the level , 
the origin and the type of information ”, the third filter in section 4.8.4 “Accepted 
information depending on the mode  and the type of information ”. 
4.8.1.3  If a message contains level transition informat ion, any other information in that message 
shall be evaluated considering  the level transition information.  
4.8.1.3.1  Information received in the same message as an immediate level transition order or a 
conditional level transition order that causes a level transiti on shall be evaluated against 
the first filter in two steps:  
1) A first evaluation shall take place considering the on -board currently operated level, 
as if a level transition order for further location had been received (i.e. the condition 
[1] or [2] of Figu re 3, if applied, shall be automatically fulfilled).  
2) Then, if relevant, information to which the condition [1] or [ 2] of Figure 3 applies shall 
be immediately extracted from the buffer and re -evaluated according to the new 
selected level. The information a ccepted or rejected immediately considering the on -
board currently operated level shall not be re -evaluated according to the new selected 
level.  
4.8.1.4  Note:  As shown in Figure 3, information stored following an announcement of a change 
of level, is re -checked fo r acceptance when the level has changed. This implies that, 
when the level changes, the mode is - for a short moment – still unchanged, until the 
stored information has been processed. The consequence for the Third Filter is that 
information needs to be ac cepted for this short period also in modes in which this 
information is otherwise useless.  
4.8.1.5  If a message contains infill information, this latter shall be evaluated considering  all other 
non-infill information in that message.  
4.8.1.6  When evaluating trackside info rmation received by radio or when re -evaluating a set of 
information released from the transition buffer, linking information, if any, shall be 
evaluated prior to any other location related information .

4.8.2  Assumptions  
4.8.2.1  The following tables shall be applied assum ing that:

 a) the information complies with the system version checks (see section 3.17.3) and with 
the data consistency checks.(see section 3.16)  
b) with the exception of information part of an SM authorisation, the direction for which 
the information is valid matches the current train orientation, or  the balise group 
crossing direction (for SL , PS and SH engines).(see section 3.6.3)  
c) In level 2, it is assumed that the “RBC” information which is marked “A” (Accepted) 
comes from the supervising RBC (see RBC/RBC handover). If this information is 
received from the “Accepting” RBC while the “Handing Over” RBC is still responsible, 
it is stored onboard until the RBC transition is performed  
Exception  1: The information “Acknowledgement of Train Data”, "Session 
Management" and “Acknowledgement of Session Termin ation" shall be immediately 
accepted.  
Exception  2: The information “RBC transition order”, “Request to shorten  MA”, 
“Revocation of Emergency Stop” and “LSSMA display toggle on/off order” shall be 
rejected.  
d) to check exception [4] in 4.8.3, the track description is referred to the SOLR (i.e. 
relocation has been performed see 3.6.4.3) . 
e) the information from balise is received while no movement opposite to the authorised 
direction is performed (see clause 3.14.3.6)  
4.8.2.2  Regarding 4.8.2.1 a): In case a balise is missed or a balise telegram cannot be decoded, 
the information “ Inhibition of balise group message consistency reaction” is only used by 
the o n-board equipment to inhibit the service brake reaction, while the balise group 
message is rejected. If all the telegrams from a balise group are correctly read, the 
information “ Inhibition of balise group message consistency reaction”, if received, shall 
be ignored by the on -board equipment. Therefore this information need not to be referred 
to in the following tables.  
4.8.2.3  In case a balise telegram contains the information VBC marker and a country/region 
identity that both match a stored VBC, the whole balise telegram is ignored and any 
further check in relation to this balise telegram is irrelevant (refer to 3.15.9. 3 b)). 
Otherwise the information VBC marker, if included in a consistent balise group message , 
shall always be ignored by the ERTMS/ETCS on -board e quipment and  need not to be 
referred to in the following tables . 
4.8.2.4  Note: with the exception of the data that is forwarded to a National System through the 
STM interface (see 3.15.6 and SUBSET -035), what will happen to the data to be used 
by applications outs ide ERTMS/ETCS (e.g. whether it is discarded, forwarded to an 
external application, processed by a national function…) is outside the scope of this 
specification and is assumed as not being part of the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 
functionality.  
4.8.2.5  Note: the system ve rsion order received from balise group need not be referred to in the 
following tables because it is taken into account by the on -board equipment prior to the 
checks referred to in this section (see also clause 3.17.3.3).

 4.8.5  Handling of transition buffer in case of level transition announcement or 
RBC/RBC handover  
4.8.5.1  If an order to switch to level NTC, 1 or 2 at a further location has been received, the 
ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment shall be able to store in a transition buffer (see figure 
3, first filter) three sets of inform ation obtained from three filtered messages.  
4.8.5.2  If an RBC transition order has been received and the Handing Over RBC is still the 
supervising one, the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment shall be able to store in a 
transition buffer (see figure 3, second filter) th ree sets of information obtained from three 
filtered messages from the Accepting RBC.  
4.8.5.2.1  Note: t he term “set of information” refers to the part of a message being stored in the 
transition buffer (i.e. information which is neither accepted nor rejected immedia tely) 
according to the conditions stated in 4.8.3.1 [1] and [2] (for level transition) or according 
to 4.8.2.1c (for RBC/RBC handover).  
4.8.5.3  In case three sets of information are already stored in the transition buffer, any new set 
to be stored shall replace th e oldest one currently stored.  
4.8.5.4  The sets of information stored in the transition buffer shall be deleted:  
a) in case the level transition order is deleted or overwritten by another level transition 
order for a different level, OR  
b) in case the RBC transition order is deleted or overwritten by an order to switch to 
another Accepting RBC , OR 
c) in case the communication session with the RBC that provided the stored information 
is terminated  
4.8.5.5  At the same time the level transition is performed or at the sam e time the Accepting RBC 
becomes the supervising one, the sets of information stored in the transition buffer shall 
be released and re -evaluated in the sequence they have been received.  
4.8.5.6  This sequential re -evaluation of all the released information shall be  a prerequisite to any 
use by the on -board equipment (e.g. it will lead neither to an intermediate change of 
mode nor to a change of information displayed to the driver) and shall obey the following 
principles:  
a) Starting from the information currently used by on -board at the moment the level/RBC 
transition is effective, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall determine the new 
information for train supervision, by performing sequential updates from the 
information released from the transition buffer, if acce pted.  
b) For each information update related to a re -evaluated set of information, the same 
rules shall apply as to information update related to new information accepted outside 
a level/RBC transition context.  
c) The information resulting from this sequential u pdate shall then be used by the 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment.

 4.8.5.7  Accepting re -evaluated Conditional Emergency Stop information according to table 4.8.3 
implies that the accepted Conditional Emergency Stop information may be accepted or 
rejected in a further step (see clause 3.10.2.2) depending on the given stop location. This 
decision , based on the comparison between the min safe front end position of the train 
at the time the message was received and the given stop location, shall be  considered 
part of the e valuation process as it affects the further re -evaluation of information stored 
in the transition buffer (see clause 3.10.2.4).  
4.8.5.7.1  Note: For the case of the Unconditional Emergency Stop information accepting the 
information according to table 4.8.3 will alway s lead to the train being tripped (see clause 
3.10.2.3) when re -evaluation of the transition buffer is completed. Information accepted 
during re -evaluation of information stored in the transition buffer can then be affected on 
transition to TR mode accordi ng to conditions in Table 4.10.  
4.8.5.8  Note: The requirement to acknowledge an Emergency Stop information according to 
clause 3.10.1.4, i.e., communicating to the RBC if the information has been accepted 
(Conditional or Unconditional Emergency Stop) or rejected b ecause the train has passed 
the stop location (Conditional Emergency Stop only) , applies to the time when the 
information is used, immediately after the sequential update has been completed.  
Regards acknowledging the reception of an emergency stop message,  as for any other 
information received from trackside, see clause 3.16.3.5.

 4.11 What happens to stored information when exiting NP mode  
4.11.1.1  Status of stored information, which is set to "Invalid" when No Power mode is entered, 
shall be affected, when relevant, by information from the Cold Movement Detection 
function, according to the following table:

4.11.1.2  Note: Status of stored information, which remains valid after NP mode has been entered, 
is not affected by information from the Cold Movement Detection function.  
4.11.1.3  If a cold movement has been detected (see section 3.15.8), or the Cold Movement 
Detection fun ction  is not able to confirm that no cold movement has taken place, no 
change of status of information to “valid” shall be made until it has been validated by a 
different means than cold movement detection.  
4.11.1.4  In case Supervised Manoeuvre, Shunting or Passive  Shunting mode was left to No 
Power mode and a stored and not yet evaluated immediate level transition order or 
conditional level transition order has to be evaluated (see 4.4.8.1.5 , 4.4.20.1.11  and 
4.4.21.1.11.1 ), the following shall apply:  
a) The above table in 4.11.1.1 shall not affect the previously applicable level and the 
table of trackside supported levels, which were set to "Invalid" when No Power mode 
was entered ; 
b) The previously applicable level which was set to "Invalid" when No Power mode was 
entered, shall be considered as the current level for the evaluation of the immediate 
level transition order or the conditional level transition order ; 
c) By exception to 5.10.4.1 b), any level change, which result from the immediate level 
transition order or t he conditional level transition order, shall not lead to any driver 
acknowledgment ; 
d) The table of trackside supported levels, which was applicable and was set to "Invalid" 
when No Power mode was entered, shall be deleted ; 
e) The level and the table of tracksid e supported levels, which result from the immediate 
level transition order or the conditional level transition order, shall be set to “invalid” 
and the above table in 4.11.1.1 shall be applied to them by analogy.

 4.12 What happens to an ongoing brake command wh en entering a 
given mode  
4.12.1.1  The reason for which a brake command has been triggered in a given mode may be 
influenced by a mode transition.  
4.12.1.2  Depending on which mode is entered, the action shall be one of the following:  
a) the brake command reason is revoked, i.e.  it does not apply anymore in the context 
of the entered mode  
b) the brake command reason is maintained, i.e. it remains applicable in the context of 
the entered mode  
c) the brake command reason is to be re -evaluated according to the data available in 
the entere d mode  
d) not relevant (there is no transition from the mode in which the brake command reason 
could be applicable to the entered mode or the transition condition(s) to the entered 
mode can only be fulfilled when the condition(s) to release the brake command 
associated to this individual reason (see 3.14.1) is(are) fulfilled)  
e) not defined (the action on the brake command reason cannot be determined. This 
concerns the entry in SF and IS modes)

 5.3 Introduction  
 Scope and Purpose  
5.3.1.1  This document defines the procedures that are necessary for interoperability within the 
scope of ERTMS/ETCS.  
5.3.1.2  Each procedure is defined by a set of mandatory requirements and , where convenient, 
is illustrated by a flowchart.  
5.3.1.3  In case the condition(s) in chap ter 4 triggering a mode transition is(are) fulfilled, this 
transition shall be executed even if not shown in the chapter 5 procedures . 
5.3.1.3.1  Note: Such a mode transition could lead to exit ing a procedure immediately (e. g. cut off 
power of on -board equipment, is olation of on -board equipment).  
5.3.1.4  National operation rules (outside of ERTMS/ETCS) are also excluded, but may be 
applied by the railways in addition to the procedures as long as interoperability is 
retained.  
 Definitions  
5.3.2.1  Procedures  
A procedure defines the req uired reaction of the ERTMS/ETCS entities (subsystems and 
components) to either information exchanged between ERTMS/ETCS entities or events 
(triggered by external entities or internal events). The procedures focus on the required 
change in status and mode of the described ERTMS/ETCS entities.  
5.3.2.2  Entities  
The procedures define the required system behaviour on a context level, i. e. the entities 
that are used to define the procedures are for example: the on -board equipment, the 
trackside equipment (RBC/Balise), the driver.  
5.3.2.3  States  
States are situations of an ETCS subsystem with a specific set of available functions and 
a specific set of events that may start or terminate the state. A state remains active as 
long as the conditions to trigger the transition to a suc ceeding state are not completely 
satisfied.  
Note 1: one mode of operation may include several states for the on -board equipment.  
Note 2: A new state is only created, if the behaviour of the system differs from another 
one. Possession of information (e. g.  location information) or not does not force 
branching in states.  
5.3.2.4  Transitions  
Transitions define the rules for passing from one state to another. A transition is triggered 
by a set of conditions which has to be fulfilled in a defined order or at the same time.

 When a transition refers to a driver’s selection, it means that the conditions to enable the 
corresponding button on the DMI were fulfilled.

 5.4 Procedure Start of mission  
 Introduction  
5.4.1.1  The driver may have to start a mission:  
a) Once the train is awake , OR 
b) Once shunting movements are finished, OR  
c) Once a mission is ended, OR  
d) Once a desk is opened (e.g. when a slave engine becomes a leading engine ). 
5.4.1.2  The common point of all these situations is that the ERTMS/ETCS on -board is in Stand -
By mode, but the Start  of Mission will be different, since some data may be already stored 
on-board, depending on the previous situation.  
5.4.1.3  Once the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment is in Stand -By mode, the start of mission 
is not the only possibility, the engine may be come  remote c ontrolled ( i.e. the on -board 
switches to Sleeping  mode ). 
5.4.1.4  If, upon desk opening, there is an already established communication session for which 
no termination is ongoing, th e ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall first terminate 
this communication session.  
 Status of data stored in the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment  
5.4.2.1  At the beginning of the Start of Mission procedure, the data required may be in one of 
three states:  
a) “valid” (the stored value is known to be correct)  
b) “Invalid” (the stored value may be wrong)  
c) “Unknown”  (no stored value available)  
5.4.2.2  This refers to the following data: Driver ID, ERTMS/ETCS level, RBC contact information , 
Train Data, Train Running Number, Train Position ( see 3.6.1.3 ). 
5.4.2.3  Note 1: The status of data in relation to the  previous and the actual mode is described in 
chapter 4, section "What happens to stored information when entering a mode".  
5.4.2.4  Note 2: The change of status of data in course of the procedure is shown in the table in 
section 5.4.3.3 . 
 Table of requirements for “Start of Mission” procedure  
5.4.3.1  The ID numbers in the table are used for the representation of the procedure in form of 
a flow chart in section 5.4.4 .

alphanumeric list of available and allowed GSM -R networks, based on a request to the 
GSM -R Mobile Terminal(s):  
• If this list is empty ( E3) the process shall go to A29 
• If the driver selects a new GSM -R Radio Network ID  from the proposed list, the 
registration of the GSM -R Mobile Terminal(s) to this new GSM -R Radio Network 
shall be ordered and  if not “unknown”  the status of the RBC  contact information  
shall be immediately set to “ invalid ”. 
 
If the Radio Network type is F RMCS+GSM -R while both radio systems are installed on -
board, and either the FRMCS on -board is registered to the FRMCS Radio Network  or 
at least one GSM -R Mobile Terminal is duly registered to a GSM -R Radio Network, the 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall al so offer the possibility to the driver to perform 
the mission with only one radio system. If the driver elects to do so ( E17), the process 
shall go to A43.

5.4.5.1  Nominally, accidental loss of an already open session (that can occur at any step) has 
not been taken into account for the design of the  SoM flowchart. However, should such 
a fault occur above D11 the nominal procedure applies (refer to D11 in flowchart). On 
the other hand, if it occurs in any step further than D11, the process shall go to S10.  
5.4.5.2  The SoM  flowchart described in section 5.4.3 only includes the main paths and does not 
exhaustively cover the various operational situations, which could occur while performing 
the SoM procedure (e.g. when revised instructions are given to the driver or when the 
driver needs to re -enter already captured data).  
5.4.5.3  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall also offer the driver the following 
possibilities, in addition to the ones that are described in section 5.4.3:  
a) only at S10 and S20 and if the conditions defined in 5. 8.2.1 for Stand By are fulfilled , 
to select “Override”. If the driver chooses to do so, then the process shall go to the 
procedure “Override” and, if the position is still invalid, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 
shall delete the train position data (new status: “ unknown”)  
b) only at S10 and S20,  to re-enter the Driver -ID 
c) only at S10 and S20, to re-enter the “Train running number”  
d) only at S20,  to re-enter the Train data . If the driver chooses to do so , then the process 
shall go to S12.  
e) only at S10 and S20, to re -enter  the Level. If the driver chooses to do so, t hen the 
process shall go to S2  
f) only at S20, to select “Non Leading ”. If the driver chooses to do so, then the 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall immediately switch to Non Leading mode 
and, if the position is still invalid, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board shall delete the train 
position data (new status: “unknown”).  
g) only at S20,  to select “Shunting”. If the driver chooses to do so, then the process shall 
go to the procedure “Shunting initiated by driver” and, if the position is still invalid, the 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board shall delete the train position data (new status: “unknown”). 
If, in level 2, the RBC rejects the request for Shunting, the process shall go back to 
S20. 
h) only at S10, if valid Train Data is available, to select “Start”. If the driver chooses to 
do so:  
• if the level is 0, then the process shall go to S23.  
• if the level is  NTC, then the process shall go to S22.

 5.5 Procedure End of Mission  
 Introduction  
5.5.1.1  End of mission refers to the situation where the trackside stops to authorise the 
movement of a unit. End of mission is initiated by the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment 
when entering specific modes (see below).  
 Entry to Mode Considered as an End of Mission:  
5.5.2.1  Stand -By mode  
5.5.2.1.1  From FS , AD , LS, OS, SM, UN, NL,  SR, PT, RV or SN mode, the entry of the 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment into the Stand -by mode is considered as an End of 
Mission  
5.5.2.1.2  Note: While in SN mode (level  NTC), some other conditions to end the mission may 
depend on the National Sy stem . 
5.5.2.1.3  The entry of the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment into the S tand-by mode, from PT

“End of Mission”.  
End of Procedure, if the  mode entered is Stan d-By upon desk closure.  
 Note: i t is a trackside implementation issue to decide when  it is appropriate to send a 
session termination order to an ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment  having reported its 
end of mission furth er to a desk closure.  
5.5.3.1.4  If the mode entered is Shunting  or Stand -By while a desk is still open (e.g. after the driver 
has selected “Exit SM”) and a  communication session with an RBC exists:  
Step 3 -  The RBC shall request to terminate the communication session.  
Step 4 - The ERTM S/ETCS on -board equipment shall terminate the communication 
session

 5.7 Entry in Shunting with Order from Trackside  
 General Requirements  
5.7.1.1  This procedure is used to allow the entry of a train into a shunting area.  
5.7.1.2  Note: The shunting area, possibly including a “safety envelope”, can be already occupied 
by shunt ing units, not controlled by the trackside. It is therefore possible that the train 
shall enter into the shunting area in OS mode. The switch to OS is performed according 
to the relevant procedure.   
5.7.1.3  The order to switch to SH mode shall be given by means o f a mode profile, optionally 
with a list of balise  groups , which the train can pass when the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 
equipment is in shunting mode.  
5.7.1.4  The switch to shunting, if the transition to shunting was ordered by trackside, requires a 
driver acknowledgemen t, according to the specifications below.  
5.7.1.5  When the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment has switched to Shunting mode, End of 
Mission, according to chapter 5.5.2.3 , is performed.  
 Shunting is requested for the current location (from modes different from 
Stand By and Post Trip)  
5.7.2.1  In a level 1 area, or at the border from a level 0 to a level 1 area, the begi nning of the 
shunting area can be the location where a balise group is installed. In level 2 it is possible 
to send an ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment the order to switch to shunting at the 
current location.  
5.7.2.2  Shunting is requested for the current location mea ns that, according to the mode profile 
received the max safe front end of the train is at or in advance of the location for which 
switching to SH mode is requested.  
5.7.2.3  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall switch immediately to SH mode and a 
request for ack nowledgement shall be displayed to the driver (refer to SRS chapter 4, 
transitions between modes).  
5.7.2.4  If the driver does not acknowledge within the driver acknowledgement time (refer to 
Appendix A .3.1) after the change to SH mode, the service brake command sh all be 
triggered.  
 Shunting is requested for a further location  
5.7.3.1  An order to switch to SH at a further location can be sent  
a) in a level 1 area by a balise group,  
b) in a level 2 area by the RBC.

 5.7.3.2  A request for acknowledgement shall be displayed to the driver, whe n the following two 
conditions are fulfilled:  
a) the distance between the estimated front end of the train and the beginning of 
shunting area is shorter than a value, contained in the mode profile  
b) the speed is equal to or lower than the Shunting mode speed limit (National Value, or 
value given in the mode profile)  
5.7.3.3  Once the request for acknowledgement is displayed, it shall not be taken back, even if 
the above conditions are no more fulfilled (e.g., the train accelerates).  
5.7.3.4  Intentionally deleted.  
5.7.3.5  When the driver acknowledges, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall 
immediately switch to SH mode (refer to chapter 4, transitions between modes).  
5.7.3.6  If the max safe front end of the train reaches the beginning of the shunting area according 
the mode profile and the  driver has not yet acknowledged, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 
equipment shall switch immediately to SH mode and a request for acknowledgement 
shall be displayed to the driver (refer to SRS chapter 4, transitions between modes).  
5.7.3.7  If, in this case, the driver doe s not acknowledge within the driver acknowledgement time 
(refer to Appendix A .3.1) after the change to SH mode, the service brake command shall 
be triggered.  
 Shunting from Stand By or Post Trip mode  
5.7.4.1  When performing a SoM or a Train Trip procedure and when the current level is 2, the 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment can receive a mode profile giving an Shunting area 
whose beginning has already been passed by the train with its max safe front end. In 
this case, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall first requi re an acknowledgement 
from the driver.  
5.7.4.2  When the driver acknowledges, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall perfo rm 
transition to Shunting mode.

 5.8 Procedure Override  
 Introduction  
5.8.1.1  In specific degraded situations (for example in the case of a failed signal, failed track 
circuit, failed point…), railways allow a train to pass its End of Movement Authority.  
5.8.1.2  For ERTMS/ETCS, passing an End of Movement Authority  can be required in degraded 
situations, e.g.  
• In level 2, if a train is stopped without MA in a location where radio is unavailable 
(e.g. after having received an emergency message, or after a train trip) . 
• In level 2, if a train is stopped at the border between two adjacent RBCs (e.g. the 
interface between RBCs is unavailable).  
• In level 2, if a train is stopped after having passed the border between two adjacent 
RBCs (e.g. the connection to the Accepting R BC cannot be established).  
• In level 2, if the RBC is unable to give a permission to run (e.g. lost connection with 
the interlocking)  
• In level 1, if a signal cannot show a proceed aspect (e.g., signal failure, route cannot 
be set)  
• In level 1, if a train is stopped without MA (e.g. after the MA has been shortened due 
to a time -out). 
5.8.1.3  In level 0 /NTC  areas, passing a signal at danger is only a national procedure. The 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment is not involved in this procedure, since it does not 
supervise the  train movements.  
5.8.1.4  In ERTMS equipped areas (level 1 or 2), locations where the train shall stop are 
supervised by the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment. Receiving an order from the 
signalman to pass the End of Movement Authority , the driver must then be able to inhibit 
this supervision.  
5.8.1.4.1  Note: The driver must not us e the “Override” procedure unless authorised by trackside 
personnel. This authorisation  is covered by operational procedures.  
5.8.1.5  If a signal at danger  must be passed between announcement and execution of the level 
transition from an unfitted area (level 0) or from an area fitted with a National System 
(level NTC) to an ERTMS equipped area (level 1 or 2 ), the signalman gives the order to 
the driver to select “override”.  
5.8.1.6  Note: By using this procedure the driver is fully responsible for the train driving. Theref ore 
Staff Responsible mode is entered when the driver selects “override”.  
5.8.1.7  In addition the procedure allows to avoid a train trip when passing a balise group:  
a) transmitting "stop if in SR mode"  
b) not contained in the list of expected balises in SR mode

 c) transm itting "stop if in SH mode"  
d) not contained in the list of expected balises in SH mode"  
e) Intentionally deleted  
5.8.1.8  Further, the Override procedure allows a train in SR mode reaching the end of the SR 
distance to proceed (see also 4.4.11.1. 6.5) 
5.8.1.9  In case the Overrid e procedure is selected while the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment 
considers a temporary EOA (as per clause 3.12.2.4, 3.12.4.7 or 3.12.5.8) which is closer 
than the EOA,  all the instances of the term EOA throughout this section 5.8 shall relate 
to this tempor ary EOA.  
 Selection of “Override”  
5.8.2.1  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall allow the driver to select “Override” only 
when:  
a) The train speed is under or equal to the speed limit for triggering the “override” function 
(national value) AND  
b) The current mode is F ull Supervision , Automatic Driving , Limited Supervision, On 
Sight, Staff Responsible, Shunting, Unfitted, Post Trip, Stand By (in level 2 only)  or 
SN (National  System)  AND  
c) Validated Train Data and Train running number are  available (except when already in 
Shunting mode).  
5.8.2.2  Intentionally deleted . 
5.8.2.3  The “Override” procedure shall be triggered when selected by the driver.  
 Once the “Override” procedure has been triggered  
5.8.3.1  The mode shall change as follows:  
a) If the current mode is Ful l Supervision , Automatic Driving , Limited Supervision, On 
Sight, Stand -By or Post Trip, the mode shall immediately switch to the Staff 
Responsible (SR) mode (if the mode is already SR it remains unchanged)  
b) If the current mode is Shunting the mode shall rem ain unchanged  
c) If the current mode is Unfitted (level 0 area) or S N (level NTC area ) the mode shall 
only change to Staff Responsible when the level changes to 1 or 2 (refer to SRS 
chapter 4, transitions between modes)  
5.8.3.1.1  If the mode, when activating Override, is OS , LS, FS or AD , the former EOA /LOA  shall 
be retained. If the mode is SB or PT  and there is a valid train position stored on -board , 
the current position of the train front shall be considered as the former EOA /LOA . If the 
mode is SB or PT and there is no valid train position stored on -board, the on -board shall

 supervise a zero distance from the virtual train front position (see section 3.6.7) to the 
former EOA/LO A. 
5.8.3.1.2  Note: This former EOA /LOA  will be used as a Trip condition if the Override function  is no 
longer active. Any further activation of the Override in SR mode has no effect on the 
former EOA /LOA . 
5.8.3.1.3  The former EOA /LOA  shall be deleted  if: 
a) the train reads the i nformation “stop if in SR mode” from a balise group OR  
b) SR mode is left.  
5.8.3.2  Note 1: In level 2, if radio communication is available, the RBC is only informed that the 
Override has been triggered by means of the reported mode change (if there is any)  
5.8.3.3  Note 2: In  level 2, if the ERTMS/ETCS - onboard equipment is able to report the mode 
change to the RBC, the RBC may transmit limits for the distance to run in SR mode 
(overriding the national value), a list of balise  group s to be passed in SR mode (refer to 
chapter 4, Staff Responsible mode)  
5.8.3.4  Note  3: In level 2, the transition to SR mode triggered by selecting Override revokes all 
emergency stop orders previously received.  
5.8.3.5  In SR mode the driver may modify the value of the SR mode speed limit and of the 
distanc e to run in SR mode (refer to chapter 4, Staff Responsible mode)  
5.8.3.6  The train trip shall be inhibited (suppression of the transition to the Trip mode), and only 
in level 0, 1 or 2, the MRSP shall include the Override function related Speed Restriction  
(see 3. 11.10) as long as the Override function is active . 
5.8.3.7  The status “override active” shall be indicated to the driver.  
5.8.3.7.1  Exception 1: In case the Override function has been activated by an STM (see SUBSET -
035) and as long as the on -board is in level NTC , the stat us “override active” shall not 
be indicated to the driver . 
5.8.3.7.2  Exception 2: In case the Override function has been activated by selection of “Override” 
while being in level 0, 1  or 2, the status “override active” shall stop be ing indicated to the 
driver on exe cuting a transition to level NTC  and shall remain unindicated as long as the 
on-board is in level NTC . 
5.8.3.8  As long as the Override function is active, new SR distance information received from 
Euroloop  shall be rejected.  
5.8.3.9  When “Override” is selected and Override is already active , the supervision of the time 
and distance (see 5.8.4.1 a) and b)) for train trip suppression  shall be re -started . 
 End of Override procedure  
5.8.4.1  The Override procedure  shall end when at least one of the  following conditions is fulfilled:

 5.9 Procedure On -Sight  
 General Requirements  
5.9.1.1  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall be in On Sight mode before the train 
reaches the beginning of the On Sight area or, at the latest, when the train reaches the 
beginning of the On Sight area.  
5.9.1.2  An ackn owledgement for running in On Sight mode is requested from the driver. The 
conditions of the acknowledgement are specified below.  
 On Sight is requested for current location (from modes different from 
Stand By and Post Trip)  
5.9.2.1  In a level 1 area, the beginning  of the On Sight area can be the balise (group) that gives 
the Mode Profile. When the train passes the balise group and receives this information, 
the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall immediately switch to On Sight mode.  
5.9.2.2  In a level 2 area, the ERTMS/ETC S on -board equipment can receive a mode profile 
giving an On Sight area which the train position confidence interval  already overlaps . If 
starting from the min safe front end of the train this On Sight area is the furthest area that 
the train position conf idence interval overlaps within the mode profile , the ERTMS/ETCS 
on-board equipment shall immediately switch to On Sight mode.  
5.9.2.3  The driver must acknowledge the On Sight mode. A request of acknowledgement shall 
be displayed to the driver.  
5.9.2.4  If the driver has n ot acknowledged within  the driver acknowledgement time (refer to 
Appendix A .3.1) after the change to OS  mode , the service brake command shall be 
triggered.  
5.9.2.5  Note: Once in On Sight mode, the speed supervision is such that the train speed cannot 
exceed the OS mode speed limit. If, when entering the On Sight mode, the train speed 
was higher than the OS mode  speed limit (because a higher speed was allowed in Full 
Supervision mode , in Automatic Driving mode , in Limited Supervision mode  or in Staff 
Responsible mode) then a service/emergency brake command could be immediately 
triggered, independently of the acknowledgement of the driver, but because of the On 
Sight su pervision (see  Figure 4 ).

lateral signals (if available) can also order the driver to decrease the train speed.  
5.9.2.7  If the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment is already in OS mode when receiving the OS 
mode profile, no further acknowledgement shall be requested from the driver.  
 On Sight is requested for a further location  
5.9.3.1  The beginning of the On Sight area can be a location that the train has not reached yet. 
This occurs when:  
a) In a level 1 area, a balise group gives a Mode Profile with an On Sight area that is 
located at a further location.  
b) In a level 2 area, the RBC gives a Mode Profile with an On Sight area that is located 
at a further location.  
5.9.3.2  A reques t for acknowledgement shall be displayed to the driver when the following 
conditions are fulfilled:  
a)  The distance between the estimated front end of the train and the beginning of On 
Sight area is shorter than a value, contained in the mode profile.   
b) The speed is equal to or lower than the On Sight mode speed limit (national value, or 
value given in the mode profile).  
c) The current mode is not On Sight  
5.9.3.3  The conditions 5.9.3.2 a) and b) define the “rectangle of acknowledgement”.  
5.9.3.4  Once the acknowledgement  request is displayed, it shall not be taken back if the train 
leaves the “rectangle of acknowledgement” (for example: because the train accelerates).

equipment shall first require an OS acknowledgement from the driver.  
5.9.5.2  When the driver acknowledges, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall perform 
the transition to On Sight mode.”  
 Exit of On Sight mode  
5.9.6.1  General rule  
5.9.6.1.1  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall exit the On Sight mode when the min safe 
front end of the train passes the end of the On Sight area.  
5.9.6.2  First case: The On Sight area ends at the EOA /LOA  of the current MA  
5.9.6.2.1  This occurs when the end of the On Sight area that is given by the Mode Profile has the 
same location as the EOA /LOA  of the related MA.  
5.9.6.2.2  In this case, the train must receive a new Movement Authority to be able to exit the On 
Sight area.  
5.9.6.2.3  Note: In an On Sight area there is no guarantee for the RBC that the track in front of the 
supervised train is free. Therefore, if the next block section is free, the RBC has 
nevertheless to ensure that there is no train/vehicle between the train and the end of the 
On Sight area. This information  
• can b e given  to the RBC by the signalman or any other trackside means  (outside 
scope of  ERTMS/ ETCS ), or 
• can be inquired by the RBC by means of the following mechanism: the RBC sends a 
“track ahead free” request which the ERTMS/ ETCS on -board equipment displays  to 
the driver. If the driver confirms that the track is free up to the end of the current 
section, the ERTMS/ ETCS on -board equipment will transmit this information to the 
RBC.  
5.9.6.2.4  Note: Receiving the “track ahead free” information, the RBC may be able to tra nsmit an 
MA from the current position of the train, e.g., for Full Supervision (refer to SRS chapter 
4, transitions between modes).  
5.9.6.3  Second case: The On Sight area ends before the EOA /LOA  of the current MA  
5.9.6.3.1  In this case, the current Movement Authority alread y allows the train to exit the On Sight 
area.  
5.9.6.3.2  When exiting the On Sight area, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment switches either 
to Full Supervision , to Limited Supervision  or to Shunting mode (refer to SRS chapter 4, 
transitions between modes).

 5.10 Level Transitions  
 General requirements  
5.10.1.1  Every level transition border to an area where operation in level 2 or NTC is supported 
shall be announced to the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment via balise group or via the 
RBC.  
5.10.1.2  A level transition announcement to the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall consist 
of an order to execute the level transition at a further location corresponding to the 
border.  
5.10.1.3  When the ERTMS/ ETCS on -board equipment receives a level transition announcement, 
and if this announcement will result in a change of the on -board level, it shall immediately 
inform the driver about the announced level transition.  
5.10.1.3.1  Note: In a mixed level area the actual le vel of the on -board equipment may remain 
unchanged even though a level transition boundary is passed.  
5.10.1.4  At the level transition border a balise group shall be placed with an immediate level 
transition order or a conditional level transition order . 
5.10.1.4.1  Note: Balise groups are read in all levels and level transition orders and conditional level 
transition orders from balises are accepted independent of the level of operation. Also 
sleeping units read balise groups.

be executed when the estimated front end passes the location given in the 
announcement.  
5.10.1.6  The on -board equipment shall manage only one level transition order at a time. Therefore 
a new level transition order shall replace a previously received order  that has not yet  
been  executed.  
5.10.1.6.1  If a level transition order has not yet been executed but the driver ch anges the level 
manually (see 3.18.4.2.4) this shall delete the level transition order. .

 5.10.1.7  As soon as the announcement of the level transition has been received, some data 
(mainly movement authority and track description data) from the transmission media of 
the new level shall be accepted, but shall not be used until the level transition is effective.  
5.10.1.7.1  Note: for the exhaustive list of accepted/rejected information, please refer to SRS chapter 
4.8. 
5.10.1.7.2  Note: if only track description has been received from the new media without any 
movement authority, this track description still replaces the one previously received from 
the current media when the transition is performed.  
5.10.1.8  When the onboard has performed the level transition, further data (mainly movement 
authority an d track description data) received from the transmission media of the leve l

 Table of priority of trackside supported  level s 
5.10.2.1  Any combination of ERTMS/ETCS levels 0, NTC, 1 and 2 on a given area shall be 
possible.  
5.10.2.2  The level transition announcement and the immediate or conditional level transition order 
at the border shall contain all the supported ERTMS /ETCS levels with a table of priority.  
Even if only one level is permitted this is considered as a table of priority.  
5.10.2.2.1  Note: Level 0 is considered in the same way as the other levels. This means that, for 
example, when an area permits ERTMS/ETCS level 0, an d is fitted with ERTMS/ETCS 
level 1 and 2, the track -side includes levels 0, 1 and 2 in a table of priority of supported 
levels in all level transition order s and conditional level transition orders  applying to that 
area. 
5.10.2.3  The table of priority shall list a ll the supported levels from the highest priority level to the 
lowest one.  
5.10.2.3.1  Intentionally deleted.  
5.10.2.4  When receiving the information about all ERTMS/ETCS levels that are supported by 
trackside , the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall select from the table the level 
with the highest priority , which is available for use by  the onboard equipment . 
5.10.2.4.1  The on -board equipment shall consider an ERTMS/ETCS level as “Available for use” 
according to the following conditions : 
a) Level 2:  
• the FRMCS on -board equipment is available, i.e. the ETCS on -board has 
detected that it is in working condition, in case the stored Radio Network type

 is FRMCS or is FRMCS+GSM -R while FRMCS is the only radio system 
installed on -board, OR  
• unless the driver h as elected to perform the mission with only one radio system, 
both the FRMCS on -board equipment and at least one GSM -R Mobile Terminal 
are available (i.e. the ETCS on -board has detected that the FRMCS on -board 
and at least one GSM -R Mobile Terminal are in working condition), in case the 
stored Radio Network type is FRMCS+GSM -R while both radio systems are 
installed on -board, OR  
• while the driver has elected to perform the mission with only one radio system, 
the concerned radio equipment is available on -board  (i.e. the ETCS on -board 
has detected that it is in working condition), in case the stored Radio Network 
type is FRMCS+GSM -R while both radio systems are installed on -board, OR  
• at least one GSM -R Mobile Terminal is available on -board , i.e. the ETCS 
onboard  has detected at least one Mobile Terminal in working condition , in 
case the stored Radio Network type is GSM -R or is FRMCS+GSM -R while 
GSM -R is the only radio system installed on -board ,  
independently whether the FRMCS on -board equipment and/or the GSM -R 
Mobile Terminals  is (are) registered to their respective  network or not . 
b) Level NTC: the concerned National System  is available on -board ( if an STM is used, 
refer to SUBSET -035 for further details ). 
c) Level 0 or 1: always.  
 Note regarding a) and b): how the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment checks the 
availability of the FRMCS on -board equipment , of the GSM -R Mobile Terminals or of the 
National System (in case no STM is used) is an implementation issue.  
5.10.2.4.2  Examples : The table of tra ckside supported levels gives 2,  NTC X, 1, NTC Y. If level 1 , 
0 and NTC X are “Available for use”, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board will select NTC X level. 
If level 1 , 0 and NTC Y are “Available for use”, it will select level 1. If level 2 , 1 and 0 are  
“Available for use”, it will select level 2.  
5.10.2.5  When the onboard has selected the level it will switch to, it shall carry out the level 
transition as if it has received a level transition order to this level only i.e. it shall ignore 
the requirements related to transiti ons to the other levels.  
5.10.2.6  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall inform the driver about the selected level 
transition  only. 
5.10.2.7  If none of the ordered level(s) is available for use by the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 
equipment , it shall nevertheless make the transitio n, to the ordered level with the lowest 
priority.  
5.10.2.7.1  Justification: The On -board equipment will then indicate the trackside level to the driver 
to allow him to select the correct procedures for degraded situations.

 5.10.2.8  After level transition information has been evaluated and regardless of whether it results 
in a change of the on -board level,  the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall store its 
table of priority of trackside  supported ERTMS/ETCS levels , for further driver selection 
(see 3.18.4.2.5) . 
5.10.2.9  Only one table of  priority of trackside supported ERTMS/ETCS levels shall be applicable 
at a time . The table of priority of trackside supported ERTMS/ETCS levels included in 
level transition information shall become applicable:  
a) in case of level transition announcement, when the estimated front end has passed 
the location given in the announcement;  
b) in case of immediate level transition order or conditional level transition order, upon 
evaluation of the order.  
5.10.2.10  A table of priority o f trackside supported ERTMS/ETCS levels which is not yet applicable 
shall be deleted if:  
a) new level transition information is received, or

5.10.3.1.1  An order to connect to the RBC shall be given via balise group in rear of the border 
location.  
5.10.3.1.2  For the train to be able to enter the new area, the old area must  possess information 
about at least the first section of the new area. The information shall be transmitted to 
the train either:  
a) as an MA and track description information into the new area, or  
b) as a target speed at the border location i.e. as an LOA.  
5.10.3.1.3  When the ERTMS/ETCS communication session is open, Train Data shall be sent to the 
RBC (which acknowledges the data) unless the onboard equipment is in SL or NL mode.  
5.10.3.1.4  If no Level 2 MA and track description has been received when entering the new area,

5.10.3.2.3  A level 2 MA and track description information shall be received from the RBC before the 
level transition border. If not, the train will be tripped  at passage of the border, i.e. after 
switching to level 2, movement is not allowed without a movement authority (refer to SRS 
chapter 4, transitions between modes).  
5.10.3.2.4  The driver is responsible for entering the level 2 area at a speed not exceeding the speed  
limits of the unequipped line.  
5.10.3.2.5  When the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment has switched to the new level, it shall

or from the RBC for any route not leading to the RBC area. This is the case both if the 
train turns back and if the train continues in the same direction, but on anothe r route.  
5.10.3.3  Transition from Level 2 to Level 1 area  
5.10.3.3.1  For the train to be able to enter the new area, the old area must possess information 
about at least the first section of the new area. The information shall be transmitted to 
the train either  
a) as an MA and t rack description information into the new area, or  
b) as a target speed at the border location i.e. as an LOA.  
5.10.3.3.2  If no Level 1 MA and track description has been received when entering the new area, 
the train shall still be supervised according to the level 2 MA  previously received from 
the RBC.  
5.10.3.3.3  When the train has passed the level transition border with its min safe rear end, the 
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment of the leading engine shall send a position report to 
the RBC.  
5.10.3.3.4  After receiving this exit position report,  the RBC can order the train to terminate the

 Note: if, in order to send the session termination order, the RBC relies on a train 
integrity confirmation indicating that the confirmed rear end of the train has passed the 
border, it is assumed that this information is received by the trackside before the on -
board terminates the session when the fixed waiting time after the last repetition elapses . 
5.10.3.4  Transition  from Level 0 (Unfitted) to Level 1 area  
5.10.3.4.1  A level 1 MA and track description information shall be received before or at the level

of repetitions (see Appendix A.3.1) has been reached. If no reply is received within the 
fixed waiting time  after the last repetition, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall 
terminate the communication session.  
 Note: if, in order to send the session termination order, the RBC relies on a train 
integrity confirmation indicating that the confirmed rear end of the train has passed the 
border, it is assumed that this information is received by the trackside before the on -
board terminates the session when the fixed waiting time after the l ast repetition elapses . 
5.10.3.7  Transition from Level NTC to Level 2 area  
5.10.3.7.1  An order to connect to the RBC shall be given via balise group in rear of the border 
location.  
5.10.3.7.2  When the ERTMS/ETCS communication session is open, Train Data shall be sent to the 
RBC (which acknowledges the data) unless the onboard equipment is in SL  or NL  mode.  
5.10.3.7.3  A level 2 MA and track description information shall be received from the RBC before the 
level transition border. If not, the train will be tripped at passage of the border, i. e. after 
switching to level 2, movement is not allowed without a movement authority (refer to SRS 
chapter 4, transitions between modes).  
5.10.3.7.4  The driver is responsible for entering the level 2 area at a speed not exceeding the speed 
limits of the level NTC line.  
5.10.3.7.5  When the level transition location is passed with the estimated front end a position report 
shall be sent to the RBC . In case the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment is interfaced to 
the National System through an STM, please refer to SUBSET -035 for the STM s tate 
transition order . 
5.10.3.7.6  If an order to connect to an RBC has been received and the train will not enter the 
announced RBC area, an order to disconnect shall be sent either from balises or from 
the RBC for any route not leading to the RBC area. This is the case both if the train turns 
back and if the train continues in the same direction, but on another route.  
5.10.3.8  Transition from Level NTC to Level 1 area  
5.10.3.8.1  A level 1 MA and track description information shall be received before or at the level 
transition borde r. If not, when the level transition is performed, the train will be tripped, 
i.e. after switching to level 1, movement is not allowed without a movement authority 
(refer to SRS chapter 4, transitions between modes).  
5.10.3.8.2  The driver is responsible for entering the level 1 area at a speed not exceeding the speed 
limits of the Level NTC line.

 5.10.3.14.5  Note: The conditional level transition order allows to check, whether a train operates in 
a permitte d level e.g. following a start of mission after a cold movement. The level of a 
train driving in a permitted level will not be changed, regardless of the priority of the 
current level operated by the train.  
5.10.3.15  Transition initiated by driver  
5.10.3.15.1  In addition to th e level transitions ordered by trackside, it is also possible, at standstill, 
for the driver to change the ERTMS/ETCS level (refer to section 3.18.4.2).  
5.10.3.15.2  If the driver changes the level to 2, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall establish 
a communication  session with the RBC:  
a) immediately if valid RBC contact information is available and  
• the FRMCS on -board is registered to the FRMCS Radio Network , in case the 
stored Radio Network type is FRMCS or is FRMCS+GSM -R while FRMCS is 
the only radio system installe d on-board , OR 
• the FRMCS on -board is registered to the FRMCS Radio Network  and at least 
one GSM -R Mobile Terminal is registered to a GSM -R Radio Network, in case 
the stored Radio Network type is FRMCS+GSM -R while both radio systems 
are installed on -board, OR  
• at least one GSM -R Mobile Terminal is registered to a Radio Network , in case 
the stored Radio Network type is GSM -R or is FRMCS+GSM -R while GSM -R 
is the only radio system installed on -board ,  
OR 
b) once the driver has selected the R adio data (by the same means  as for Start of 
Mission) , if the conditions listed in item a) are not  fulfilled . 
 Note regarding b): If the level transition leads to TR mode, the request for RBC contact 
information is only displayed once the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment is in PT mode.  
5.10.3.15.3  If the driver changes the level from 2 to any other, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment 
shall report the new level to the RBC if a communication session is established. When 
receiving the level change report, the RBC shall order the communication session to be 
terminated.  
5.10.3.15.4  In case the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment has reported having changed from level 
2 to any other and no order to terminate the session is received within a fixed waiting 
time (see Appendix A.3.1) from the ti me the position report was sent , it shall repeatedly 
send a position report with the fixed waiti ng time after each repetition, until the order to 
terminate the session is received, or the defined number of repetitions (see Appendix 
A.3.1) has been reached. If no reply is received within the fixed waiting time after the last 
repetition, the ERTMS/ETCS  on-board equipment shall terminate the communication 
session.

 5.12 Change of Train Orientation  
 Introduction  
5.12.1.1  The scope of this procedure is the supervision of a train where the driver controls the 
train from the cab in the front of the train with the direction con troller in FORWARD 
position.  
5.12.1.2  This implies that when the driver has to change the orientation of the train, he has to 
change the driving cab.  
5.12.1.3  The scope of this procedure is NOT shunting movements, during which the driver 
change s the running direction of the  train without leaving the cab, by changing the 
position of the direction controller from FORWARD to REVERSE.  
5.12.1.4  The scope of this procedure is NOT the reverse  movement that is allowed in Post Trip 
or in Reversing mode.  
5.12.1.5  The scope of this procedure is NOT Supe rvised Manoeuvre movements, during which 
the train orientation can change according to the last received SM authorisation and the 
driver changes the running direction of the train without leaving the cab, by changing the 
position of the direction controlle r from FORWARD to REVERSE.  
 The driver uses the same engine  (a mission is ongoing)  
5.12.2.1  The situation is the following: The driver closes the desk A and leaves the cab A of the 
leading engine of the train, to go to cab B and open desk B of this same engine.  
5.12.2.2  Desk  A and desk B are connected to the same ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment.  
5.12.2.3  When the driver closes the desk A, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment immediately 
goes to Stand -By mode, which  is considered as an end of mission (see “End of Mission” 
procedure) . 
5.12.2.4  When t he driver opens the desk B, the “Start of Mission” procedure is triggered.  
5.12.2.5  When the driver closes a desk and opens the other one of the same engine, the 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall be able to calculate the new train position data 
(train front posit ion, train orientation), by use of the previous data.  
 The driver leaves the engine to go to another one  
5.12.3.1  The described situation is the following: The train has two engines (engine A and engine 
B). The engine A is the leading engine. The engine B is a slave  engine. Each engine has 
its own ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment.  
a) If engine B is remote controlled, its ETCS on -board equipment is in Sleeping mode.  
Note: The mode is entered when on -board equipment detects the presence of the 
"remote control" signal.

 b) If the slave engine is not remote controlled (Tandem operation) by the leading engine 
but there is a driver who controls the engine, then the on -board equipment is in Non 
leading mode.  
c) If the engine B is not remote controlled (Tandem Shunting opera tion) by the leading 
engine and there is no driver who controls the engine, then the on -board equipment 
is in Passive Shunting mode.  
5.12.3.2  Assumption: The train configuration does not change.  
a) When changing the train orientation, the leading engine A will become the slave 
engine, and the slave engine B will become the leading engine.  
b) If before the change of train orientation engine B was in SL, afterwards engine A will 
be in SL mode; If before the change of train orientation engine B was in NL, afterwards 
engine A  will be in NL mode ; If before the change of train orientation engine B was in 
PS, afterwards engine A will be in PS mode . 
5.12.3.3  Case "Engine B was in SL mode"  
5.12.3.3.1  The driver of engine A closes the desk, then the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment of 
engine A switches to  Stand -By mode. If the train has a mission, this is a end of mission 
(see “End of Mission” procedure)  
5.12.3.3.2  As soon as the remote control signal disappears, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment 
of engine B switches to Stand -By mode.  
5.12.3.3.3  Level 2: The ERTMS/ETCS on -board  equipment of engine B open s a communication 
session (if possible) and report s the mode change to the RBC.  
5.12.3.3.4  When the driver opens a desk of engine B he triggers the "Start of Mission" procedure.  
5.12.3.4  Case "Engine B was in NL mode"  
5.12.3.4.1  The driver of engine A selects "Non Leading". The ERTMS/ETCS equipment switches 
to Non Leading mode.  
5.12.3.4.2  Once the non leading input signal is not received any more , the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 
equipment of engine B will switch to Stand -By mode ( refer to SRS chapter 4, transitions 
between modes and chapter 5, “End of Mission” procedure).  
5.12.3.4.3  Because the desk is open, when the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment enters Stand -
By mode, the “Start of Mission” procedure is triggered.  
5.12.3.5  Case "Engine B was in PS mode"  
5.12.3.5.1  The driver of engine A selects "Continue Shunti ng on desk closure". The ERTMS/ETCS 
equipment switches to Passive Shunting mode once the driver closes the desk of engine 
A. 
5.12.3.5.2  The driver opens a desk in engine B, and ERTMS/ETCS equipment switches to Shunting

 The driver uses the same engine (a Shuntin g movement is ongoing)  
5.12.4.1  The situation is the following : while the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment is in Shunting 
mode, the driver closes the desk A and leaves the cab A of the Shunting engine, to go 
to cab B and open desk B of this same engine.  
5.12.4.2  Desk A and des k B are connected to the same ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment.  
5.12.4.2.1  Before closing the desk A, the driver enables the function “Continue Shunting on desk

 5.14 Joining / Spl itting  
 Definitions  
5.14.1.1  Definition for splitting: The “train to be split” is the train at standstill, waiting for being split. 
The “front train after splitting” refers to the front part of the train before splitting, the “new 
train after splitting”, refers to t he other part.  
5.14.1.2  Definitions for joining: The “train to be joined” is the train at standstill, waiting for being 
joined. The “joining train” is the train performing the joining operation.  
 Procedure “Splitting”  
5.14.2.1  Step 1 - The electrical and mechanical links bet ween the two trains must be removed 
(this is a national operational procedure, out of the scope of the SRS).  
5.14.2.1.1  Note: If splitting require s moving the two train parts apart from each other for a small 
distance, this can be done even in SB mode  
5.14.2.2  Step 2a - If the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment which was supervising the train before 
splitting has not performed an end of mission for splitting, the Train Data must be 
modified (e.g. by the driver) such that it fits with the new train composition after splitting. 
For le vel 2, the new train data is sent to the RBC (see SRS chapter 3 – Data Entry / 
Modification Process)  
5.14.2.3  Step 2b - If an ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment of the "new train after splitting" was 
in SL mode before, it will switch to SB mode once the remote control s ignal is not 
received any more (refer to SRS chapter 4, transitions between modes).  
For Level 2: The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment open s a communication session (if 
possible) and report s the mode change to the RBC.  
5.14.2.4  Step 2c - If an ERTMS/ETCS on -board equi pment of the "new train after splitting" was 
in NL mode before, it will switch to SB mode once the non leading input signal is not 
received any more (refer to SRS chapter 4, transitions between modes and chapter 5, 
“end of mission” procedure).  
5.14.2.5  The driver can then start a new mission with this “new train after splitting” (refer to the 
“Start of Mission” procedure). In all cases, to start a mission is not the only possibility. 
Shunting movements, or not moving the new train at all, are also possible.  
 
 Proced ure “Joining”  
5.14.3.1  Step 1 - The “joining train” must approach the “train to be joined”. This can be performed 
in SR, OS , SM or SH mode (depending on the information available, and on the national 
procedure for joining).

 5.14.3.2  Step 2 - The electrical and mechanical li nks between the two trains must be closed 
(vehicle dependent, outside the scope of the ETCS).  
5.14.3.3  Step 3a - If a former leading ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment remains leading and 
there was no end of mission, the driver must modify the Train Data such that it fits with 
the new train composition. For level 2, the new train data is sent to the RBC (see SRS 
chapter 3 – Data Entry / Modification Process)  
5.14.3.4  Step 3b - If a former leading ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment is to become slave 
equipment in SL mode, when closing the desk, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment 
will switch to SB mode (see SRS chapter 4, transitions betw een modes) and the end of 
mission procedure is executed (see “End of Mission” procedure). Transition to SL mode 
is from SB mode.  
5.14.3.5  Step 3c  - If a former leading ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment is to become slave 
equipment in NL mode, the driver selects NL mode  (see SRS chapter 4, transitions 
between modes).  
5.14.3.6  For further steps after joining refer to procedures “Start of Mission” and “Change of Train 
Orientation”.

 5.15 RBC/RBC Handover  
 Principles  
5.15.1.1  Every RBC/RBC handover shall be announced to the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 
equipment via a balise group or via the RBC.  
5.15.1.2  The handover announcement (i.e. RBC transition order) to the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 
equipment shall consist of an order to establish a communication session with  the 
Accepting RBC (see 3.5. 2.6.2 ) and to execute the handover at a further location 
corresponding to the border.  
5.15.1.2.1  In case of RBC/RBC handover including a change of Radio Network type and/or a 
change  of GSM -R Radio Network , ERTMS/ETCS trackside is responsible for the 
sequence of Radio Network trans ition order and order to establish a communication 
session with  the "Accepting" RBC, according to the Radio Network ’s configuration.  The 
following Radio Network transitions are possible:  
t1 GSM -R => FRMCS  (for completeness reason, i.e. the on -board only store s the 
Radio Network type and does not order any radio network registration) ; 
t2 FRMCS => GSM -R; 
t3 GSM -Rx => FRMCS+GSM -Rx (for completeness reason, i.e. the on -board only 
stores the Radio Network type and does not order any radio network registration);  
t4 GSM -Rx =>  FRMCS+GSM -Ry; 
t5 FRMCS+GSM -Rx => GSM -Rx (for completeness reason, i.e. the on -board only 
stores the Radio Network type and does not order any radio network registration);  
t6 FRMCS+GSM -Rx => GSM -Ry, communication session with “Handing Over” RBC 
through FRMCS;  
t7 FRMCS+GSM -Rx => GSM -Ry, communication session with “Handing Over” RBC 
through GSM -Rx; 
t8 FRMCS => FRMCS+GSM -R; 
t9 FRMCS+GSM -R => FRMCS (for completeness reason, i.e. the on -board only 
stores the Radio Network type and does not order any radio network registration) ; 
t10 FRMCS+GSM -Rx => FRMCS+GSM -Ry, communication session with “Handing 
Over” RBC through FRMCS;  
t11 FRMCS+GSM -Rx => FRMCS+GSM -Ry, communication session with “Handing 
Over” RBC through GSM -Rx; 
t12 GSM -Rx => GSM -Ry. 
5.15.1.2.2  In the following sections, if both radio communicatio n sessions with “Handing Over” RBC 
and “Accepting” RBC are established with GSM -R, "first" GSM -R Mobile Terminal refers 
to the one used for communication session with “Handing Over” RBC and "second" 
GSM -R Mobile Terminal to the one used for communication s ession with “Accepting” 
RBC.

 5.15.1.2.3  Note: In the following sections, Radio Networks (FRMCS and/or GSM -R) pertaining to 
the “Handing Over” RBC and “Accepting” RBC areas  are supposed to be overlapped.  
5.15.1.3  At the RBC/RBC border a balise group with an order to execute the handover 
immediately shall be placed.  
5.15.1.3.1  Note: Balise groups are read in all levels and orders from balise groups are accepted 
independent of the level of operation. Also sleeping units read balise groups.  
5.15.1.4  If the message from the border balise gro up is not (yet) received, the handover shall still 
be executed when the train with its max safe front end passes the border location 
according to the announcement  information.

 Procedure  
5.15.2.1  Overview  
5.15.2.1.1  In the normal operation, the main func tional steps needed for running from one RBC 
area to another one are the following:  
a) Pre-announcement of the transition by the “Handing Over” RBC;  
b) Depending on the Radio Network transition and the radio system through which the 
“Handing Over” RBC communicat ion session is established, registration to the 
FRMCS network of the FRMCS on -board equipment and/or registration  to the new 
GSM -R Radio Network of second GSM -R Mobile Terminal & Establishment of the 
radio communication session with the “Accepting” RBC;  
c) Generation of movement authorities including the border;  
d) Announcement of the RBC transition  
e) Transfer of train supervision to the “Accepting” RBC;  
f) Termination of the session with “Ha nding Over” RBC.  
g) Only in case of GSM -R Radio Network change and if the radio communication session 
with the “Handing over” RBC was established through GSM -R: Registration to the 
new GSM -R Radio Network of first GSM -R Mobile Terminal  
5.15.2.2  Step by step descriptio n  
5.15.2.2.1  Pre-announcement  
 When the “Handing Over” RBC generates a movement authority which reaches the 
border to another RBC area, it initiates the processes associated to the transition.  
 The “Handing Over” RBC informs the “Accepting” RBC about the RBC/RBC hando ver.

 5.15.2.2.2  Registration to the FRMCS network of the FRMCS on -board equipment and/or to 
the new GSM -R Radio Network of second GSM -R Mobile Terminal & Establishment 
of the radio communication session with “Accepting” RBC  
 A radio communication session with the Acc epting RBC is opened by the on -board 
equipment based on the RBC transition order received from the “Handing Over” RBC or 
from balise group (refer to chapter 3, section "management of radio communication").  
 In case of RBC/RBC handover including Radio Networ k change , the registration to 
the FRMCS network of the FRMCS on -board equipment (see t1, t3, t4 in 5.15.1.2.1), the 
registration  to the new GSM -R radio network of the second GSM -R Mobile Terminal (see 
t2, t4, t6, t7, t8, t10, t11, t12 in 5.15.1.2.1),  is completed before the RBC transition order 
is transmitted to the on -board equipment.  
 Depending on whether the communication session with the “Handing Over” RBC is 
established with FRMCS (see t2, t6, t8, t10 in 5.15.1.2.1), the registration to the new 
GSM -R radio network of the first GSM -R Mobile Terminal can also be completed at the 
same time . 
5.15.2.2.3  Generation of MAs including the border  
 The “Handing Over” RBC is responsible for establishing the movement authority 
based on:  
a) Information from the trackside equ ipment and interlocking of its own area (for the part 
of route related information up to the border),  
b) Information from the “Accepting RBC” for the part of route related information in 
advance of the border.

 When it is required to send a movement authority to the train, the “Handing Over” 
RBC will request from the “Accepting” RBC information needed for extending the MA in 
advance of the border.  
5.15.2.2.4  Announcement  
 When the train reaches the border with its max safe front end, the ERTMS/ETCS on -
board equipment sends a position report both to the “Handing Over” RBC and to the 
“Accepting” RBC.  
 The “Handing Over” RBC forwards the announcement information to  the “Accepting” 
RBC.  
5.15.2.2.4.2.1  Note:  The forwarding of the announcement information  is executed because the 
“Handing Over” RBC has no knowledge if the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment is in a 
degraded situation or not i.e. whether it can handle one or two communicatio n sessions.  
5.15.2.2.5  Transfer of train supervision to “Accepting” RBC  
 As soon as the on -board has sent to the “Accepting” RBC the position report  referred 
to in 5.15.2.2.4.1 , it considers to be supervised by the “Accepting” RBC i.e. it uses 
information received fro m the “Accepting” RBC.  
 When the “Accepting” RBC receives a position report from the on -board and detects 
that the max safe front end has passed the border, it takes over the responsibility and 
informs the “Handing Over” RBC.  
5.15.2.2.6  Termination of the session wit h “Handing Over” RBC  
 When the min safe rear end of the train passes the location of the border, the 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment sends a position report to the “Handing Over” RBC.  
 It is a trackside implementation issue to decide when it is appropriate to  send the 
session termination order to the on -board equipment, e.g. when the ”Handing Over” RBC  
receives a position report and detects that the minimum safe rear end of the train has 
passed the border, or after the RBC has received a train integrity confir mation indicating 
that the confirmed rear end of the train has passed the border . 
5.15.2.2.7  Registration to the new GSM -R Radio Network of first GSM -R Mobile Terminal  
 In case of RBC/RBC handover including a GSM -R Radio Network change  and if the 
communication sessio n with the “Handing Over” RBC is established through GSM -R 
(see t4, t7, t11, t12 in 5.15.1.2.1) , the registration to the new GSM -R Radio Network of 
the first GSM -R Mobile Terminal is initiated by the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment 
as soon as the communicati on session with the "Handing Over" RBC has been 
terminated and the safe radio connection has been released.

5.15.3.1.1  In case  the radio communication session with the “Handing over” RBC was established 
through GSM -R and the RBC transition order does not relate to an RBC interfaced with 
FRMCS only , the main functional steps needed for running from one RBC area to

a) Pre-announcement of the transition b y the “Handing Over” RBC;  
b) Generation of movement authorities including the border;  
c) Announcement of the RBC transition  
d) Termination of the session with “Handing Over” RBC;  
e) Registration to the new GSM -R Radio Network of the GSM -R Mobile Terminal ( only

f) Transfer of train supervision to the “Accepting” RBC.  
5.15.3.2  Step by step description  
5.15.3.2.1  Pre-announcement  
 When the “Handing over” RBC generates a movement auth ority which reaches the 
border to another RBC area, it initiates the processes associated to the transition.  
 The “Handing Over” RBC informs the “Accepting” RBC about the RBC/RBC transition.  
5.15.3.2.2  Generation of MAs including the border  
 The “Handing Over” RBC is r esponsible for establishing the movement authority 
based on (see Figure 9) 
a) Information from the trackside equipment and interlocking of its own area (for the part 
of route related information up to the border),  
b) Information from the “Accepting RBC” for the part of route related information in

 5.15.3.2.4  Termination of the session with “Handing Over” RBC  
 When the min safe rear end of the train passes the location of the border, the on -
board equipment sends a position report to the “Ha nding Over” RBC.  
 It is a trackside implementation issue to decide when it is appropriate to send the 
session termination order to the on -board equipment, e.g.  when the “Handing Over” RBC  
receives a position report and detects that the minimum safe rear end  of the train has 
passed the border, or after the RBC has received a train integrity confirmation indicating 
that the confirmed rear end of the train has passed the border . 
5.15.3.2.5  Registration to the new GSM -R Radio Network of the GSM -R Mobile Terminal ( only 
in c ase of GSM -R Radio Network change ) & Establishment of the radio 
communication session with “Accepting” RBC  
 When the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment receives the session termination order 
from the “Handing Over” RBC, it terminates the session with the “Handin g over” RBC 
and opens a session with the “Accepting” RBC (refer to chapter 3, management of radio 
communication).  
 In case of RBC/RBC handover including a GSM -R Radio Network change  towards a 
GSM -R only area or an FRMCS+GSM -R area while the RBC transition order does not 
relate to an RBC interfaced with FRMCS only and if the communication session with the 
“Handing Over” RBC is established through GSM -R (see t4, t7, t11, t12 in 5.15.1.2 .1): 
as soon as the session with the "Handing Over" RBC is terminated, the registration to 
the new GSM -R Radio Network of the GSM -R Mobile Terminal is enforced by the 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment prior to the opening of a session with the “Accepting” 
RBC (refer to chapter 3, management of radio communication).  
5.15.3.2.6  Transfer of train supervision to “Accepting” RBC  
 When the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment has established a communication 
session with the “Accepting” RBC and sent to the “Accepting” RBC a position rep ort, it 
considers to be supervised by the “Accepting” RBC, i.e. it accepts only information 
received from the “Accepting” RBC.  
 When the “Accepting” RBC receives a position report from the on -board and detects 
that the max safe front end has passed the bord er, it takes over the responsibility and 
informs the “Handing Over” RBC.  
 Other d egraded Situations  
5.15.4.1  Note: If the “Handing Over” RBC is not able to extend the MA into the area of the 
“Accepting RBC”, the driver may select "override", or manually change the l evel to move 
the train into the area of the “Accepting RBC”.  
5.15.4.2  Note: If the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment cannot open a session with the 
“Accepting RBC”, the train is stopped at the latest when it has reached the EOA  given

time (see appendix to chapter 3, List of Fixed Value Data) after sending the position 
report (see 5.15.2.2.6) , the position report is repeated with the fixed waiting time after 
each repetition . After a defined number of repetitions (see appendix to c hapter 3, List of

 General Requirements  
5.16.1.1  In case the LX is not protected, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment (in FS , AD, LS, 
OS or SM mode) first supervise s the LX start location as both temporary  EOA and SvL , 
with no release speed  (see 3.12.5.8) . 
5.16.1.2  The supervision of the LX start location as both temporary  EOA and SvL shall be 
substituted by the inclusion of the LX speed restriction in the MRSP under  conditions 
depending on whether stopping in rear of the LX start location is required or not. The 
conditions of this substitution are specified in 5.16.2 or 5.16.3 . 
5.16.1.3  The start location of the LX speed restriction depends on the substitution conditions, 
which are specified in 5.16.2 or 5.16.3.  The end location of the LX speed restriction shall 
be the LX end location.  
5.16.1.4  When approaching a non protected LX, the on -board equipment shall inform the driver 
about the status of the LX, as soon as :  
a) either the temporary EOA or the temporary SvL related to the LX start location 
becomes the Most Re levant  Displayed Ta rget (see 3.13.10.4.2) , or 
b) the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment substitutes the supervision of the LX start 
location as both temporary  EOA and SvL  by the inclusion of the LX speed restriction 
in the MRSP.  
5.16.1.5  Unless the information “LX is protected” is received o n-board, the indication given to the 
driver shall be displayed  as long as the train min safe front end is in rear of the LX end 
location .

location, will ensure that the train is able to stop before the start location of the level 
crossing, in case this latter is n ot free for the train to pass. Close to the level crossing it 
is then the responsibility of the driver to proceed or not with LX speed as a maximum.  
5.17 Changing Train Data from sources different from the driver  
 Introduction  
5.17.1.1  When valid Train Data is stored on -board, input information acquired from ERTMS/ETCS 
external sources different from the driver may affect some of the Train Data, depending 
on the type of train (e.g. tilting input information from tilting external device may affect 
the train category and th e loading gauge).  
5.17.1.2  The procedure here below describes the necessary steps performed by the 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment from the detection of an input information change on 
an external interface, to the effective encountering of the Train Data change by th e 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment.  
5.17.1.3  This procedure is not applicable for trains running in RV mode: on leaving RV mode, the 
Train Data will always be invalidated or deleted .

 5.19 Procedure Limited Supervision  
 General Requirements  
5.19.1.1  The order to switch to Limited Supervision mode shall be given by means of a mode 
profile.  
5.19.1.2  An a cknowledgement for running in Limited Supervision mode shall be requested from 
the driver. The conditions of the acknowledgement are specified below.  
 Limited Supervision is requested for current location  (from modes 
different from Stand By and Post Trip)  
5.19.2.1  In a level 1 area, the beginning of the Limited Supervision area can be the balise (group) 
that gives the Mode Profile. When the train passes the balise group and receives this 
information, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall immediately switch to Limit ed 
Supervision mode.  
5.19.2.2  In a level 2 area, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment can receive a mode profile 
giving a Limited Supervision area which the train position confidence interval  already 
overlaps . If starting from the min safe front end of the train this Limited Supervision  area 
is the furthest area that the train position confidence interval overlaps within the mode 
profile , the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall immediately switch to Limited 
Supervision mode.  
5.19.2.3  The driver must acknowledge the Limited Supe rvision mode. A request of 
acknowledgement shall be displayed to the driver.  
5.19.2.4  If the driver has not acknowledged within  the driver acknowledgement time (refer to 
Appendix A .3.1) after the change to LS  mode , the service brake command  shall be 
triggered.  
5.19.2.5  Note: Once in Limited Supervision mode, the speed supervision is such that the train 
speed cannot exceed the LS mode speed limit. If, when entering the Limited Supervision 
mode, the train speed was higher than the LS mode speed limit ( because a higher speed 
was allowed in Full Supervision mode , in Automatic Driving mode , in On Sight mode or 
in Staff Responsible mode) then a service/ emergency brake  command  could be 
immediately triggered, independently of the acknowledgement of the driver , but because 
of the LS supervision (see  Figure 22 ).

5.19.2.6  Note: This sharp brake reaction can be avoided in Full Supervision , Automatic Driving  or 
On Sight mode by giving with the previous MA an E OA (or a L OA = LS mode speed limit) 
at the location of transition to Limited Supervision mode.  
5.19.2.7  If the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment is already in LS mode when receiving the LS 
mode profile, no further ac knowledgement shall be requested from the driver.  
 Limited Supervision is requested for a further location  
5.19.3.1  The beginning of the Limited Supervision area can be a location that the train has not 
reached yet. This occurs when:  
a) In a level 1 area, a balise grou p gives a Mode Profile with an Limited Supervision area 
that is located at a further location.  
b) In a level 2 area, the RBC gives a Mode Profile with an Limited Supervision area that 
is located at a further location.  
5.19.3.2  A request for acknowledgement shall be di splayed to the driver when the following 
conditions are fulfilled:  
a) The distance between the estimated front end of the train and the beginning of Limited 
Supervision area is shorter than a value, contained in the mode profile.   
b) The speed is equal to or lower than the Limited Supervision mode speed limit (national 
value, or value given in the mode profile).  
c) The current mode is not Limited Supervision  
5.19.3.3  Note: The first 2 conditions define the “rectangle of acknowledgement”.  
5.19.3.4  Once the acknowledgement request is displayed, it shall not be taken back if the train 
leaves the “rectangle of acknowledgement” (for example: because the train accelerates).

 Limited Supervision from Unfitted or S N mode  
5.19.4.1  The mode profile with regards to an LS area is only evaluated in level 1,2, although the 
mode profile may have been received in level 0 (Unfitted mode) or NTC (SN mode). A 
transition to Limited Supervision mode can therefore earliest occur at a transition of level: 
from level 0 or NTC to level 1 or 2.  
5.19.4.2  Requirements about the acknowledgement in section 5.19.2 shall apply.  
 Limited Supervision from Stand By or Post Trip mode  
5.19.5.1  When performing a SoM or a Train Trip procedure and when the current level is 2, the 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment can receive a mode profile giving an Limited

 from the min safe front end of the train this Limited Supervision area is the furthest area  
that the train position confidence interval overlaps within the mode profile , the 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall first require an LS acknowledgement from the 
driver.

the tr ansition to Limited Supervision mode.  
 Exit of Limited Supervision mode  
5.19.6.1  General rule  
5.19.6.1.1  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall exit the Limited Supervision mode when 
the min safe front end of the train passes the end of the Limited supervision area.  
5.19.6.2  First case: The Limited supervision  area ends at the EOA /LOA  of the current MA  
5.19.6.2.1  This occurs when the end of the Limited Supervision area that is given by the Mode 
Profile has the same location as the EOA /LOA  of the related MA.  
5.19.6.2.2  In this case, the train must receive a new Movement Authority to be able to exit the 
Limited Supervision area.  
5.19.6.3  Second case: The Limited Supervision  area ends before the EOA /LOA  of the 
current MA  
5.19.6.3.1  In this case, the current Movement Authority already allows the train to exit the Lim ited 
Supervision area.  
5.19.6.3.2  When exiting the Limited Supervision area, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment 
switches either to Full Supervision, On Sight or to Shunting mode (refer to SRS chapter 
4, transitions between modes).

conditions:  
a) powerless section with pantograph to be lowered,  
b) powerless section with main power switch to be switched off,  
c) passing an “air tightness” area,  
d) inhibition of a defi ned type of brake,  
e) change of traction system,  
f) change of allowed current consumption,  
g) station platform.  
5.20.1.2  In the following sections, the remaining distance from the concerned train end to the 
concerned track condition location shall be counted positive when t he train end is in rear 
of the location and shall be counted negative when the train end is in advance of the 
location.  
 Passing a powerless section with pantograph to be lowered  
5.20.2.1  This procedure is dealing with the generation of the information related to a powerless 
section with the pantograph to be lowered.  
5.20.2.2  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall start the generation of the information to 
the ERTMS/ETCS external function when the max safe front end of the train reaches the 
point C in rear of th e start location of the powerless section (see 5.18.2.2.1 for the 
definition of point C).  
5.20.2.3  When the min safe rear end of the train is in rear of the start location (point D) of the 
powerless section, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall provide the follo wing 
information to the ERTMS/ETCS external function:

 5.22 Procedure Inhibition of balise transmission alarm reaction  
 Introduction  
5.22.1.1  As explained in 3.15.7, when the balise reading antenna is over a large metallic object 
that exceeds the Subset -036 limits (something usually called “Big Metal Mass” and in the 
following referred to as “BMM”) an alarm may be generated by the balise transmission 
system, which in turn may trigger an on -board safe reaction.  
5.22.1.2  Such “integrity check alarm of balise transmission” (in the following: “BTM alarm”) tha t 
may be generated when the balise antenna is over a BMM is not distinguishable from 
one that may be generated when the on -board balise reader system is in failure.  
5.22.1.3  Since it is not possible for the on -board to know whether the alarm was generated by a 
failure (and therefore the on -board may be unable to read balises) or by the presence of 
a BMM under the balise antenna, it is possible that a safe reaction is taken by the on -
board (for example switch to SF) when it is in fact still able to read balises.  
5.22.1.4  The track condition “Big Metal Mass” provides a means for trackside to mark areas where 
BMMs are known to exist, and so to avoid that the on -board may take a safe reaction 
when there is no need to (the on -board is able to detect balises but the antenna is over  
a BMM).  
5.22.1.5  However, there may be instances where the train is over a known BMM but the related 
track condition is not available on -board. For example, because the train is awakening 
on a metal covered area or because the driver had to select override and mov e the train 
over a metal covered area. This can result in deadlocks.  
5.22.1.6  To avoid that, the procedure detailed in this section provides a means for the driver to 
inhibit the potential safe reaction to a BTM alarm. This in turn enables a SoM or a generic 
moveme nt over a BMM in an ETCS equipped area ( level 1 or 2) when no BMM track 
condition is stored on -board.  
5.22.1.7  Note:  The driver should use the “Inhibition” procedure only when authorised to do so. 
This authorisation should be covered by operational procedures becau se to inhibit a safe 
reaction may be detrimental to safety.  
5.22.1.8  In addition, a provision is introduced to allow the procedure to be automatically triggered 
without driver intervention. This provision applies in case the train is in an area covered 
by a BMM tra ck condition stored on board, and the track condition gets reset (for example 
because of a transition to SR mode caused by Override activation).  
 Manual triggering of the procedure  
5.22.2.1  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall allow the driver to select “Inhibiti on of 
reaction to BTM alarm” only at standstill when the level is 1 or 2 and the current mode is 
Stand -By, Shunting, or Staff Responsible.

 5.22.2.2  As soon as the driver makes the selection, the “Inhibition” procedure shall be triggered.  
 Automatic triggering of the procedure  
5.22.3.1  As soon as a stored BMM track condition is reset, the “ Inhibition” procedure shall be 
automatically triggered provided that at the time of the reset the Eurobalise antenna is in 
an area where that track condition is reset, takin g into account the max and min safe 
antenna positions.  
5.22.3.1.1  Exception: the automatic triggering of the “ Inhibition” procedure shall not apply in case 
the reset is caused by a transition to NP or RV mode.  
 Once the “Inhibition” procedure has been triggered  
5.22.4.1  An ind ication shall be given to the driver, until the procedure is ended.  
5.22.4.2  Any potential on -board reaction to a “BTM alarm” shall be inhibited.  
 End of “Inhibition” procedure  
5.22.5.1  The “Inhibition” procedure shall end when at least one of the following conditions is 
fulfilled:  
a) The train has run more than the fixed distance defined in A.3.1 after the procedure 
was triggered, OR  
b) The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment switches to a mode different than Standby, 
Shunting or Staff Responsible , OR 
c) The driver ends the procedure, by r evoking the inhibition.  
5.22.5.2  Regarding a) above, the distance is the one travelled away from the location when the 
procedure was triggered and it shall be applicable in both directions.  
5.22.5.2.1  Exception: if a BMM track condition which announces a BMM area within the remaining 
distance of the manual or automatic inhibition is received, the distance for ending the 
procedure shall be shortened to the start of the announced BMM area.  
5.22.5.3  Note: the driver may revoke the inhibition following an operational procedure. For 
example, in the case of awakening over a BMM the train has moved past the limit of the 
metallic covered area and so there is no more need to have the inhibition active. 
Revoking the inhibition in turn increases safety, because i t allows the on -board to have 
a safe reaction should there be a failure in the balise reader system that was until then 
“masked” by the inhibition set manually or automatically.

 6.3 Scope 
6.3.1.1 The chapter defines: 
a) the composition of envelope of legally operated system versions, i.e. all the 
ERTMS/ETCS system versions that trackside shall be allowed to operate. 
b) the allowed envelopes of system versions supported by the on-board. 
6.3.1.2 By default, all the clauses listed in the other SRS chapters are applicable regardless of 
the system version operated (see SUBSET-104 § 6.1.3.2); this chapter includes the 
exceptions to those clauses and the additional clauses, which apply when the system 
version of some trackside constituents and/or the system version operated relates to a 
version number older than the last one introduced.

 6.5 Trackside requirements in relation to older system versions 
6.5.1 Trackside areas operated with system version number X = 1 
6.5.1.1 Introduction 
6.5.1.1.1 The section is applicable for trackside infrastructures that will be tendered and still 
operated with the system version number X = 1, after the entry into force of this release 
of the SRS. 
6.5.1.1.2 Within a trackside infrastructure operated with the system version number X = 1, it shall 
be allowed to use the following values of M_VERSION: 1.0 and 1.1. 
6.5.1.1.3 Within a trackside area operated with an RBC certified to the system version number X 
= 1, it shall also be allowed to use for balises the following values of M_VERSION: 2.0, 
2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and 3.0. 
6.5.1.1.3.1 Note: this configuration is meaningful in case the trains operating on this RBC area 
support the system version number X = 2 or 3 and the on-board requirements related to 
the trackside information marked with 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 or 3.0 are applicable regardless 
of the operated version (i.e. they are applied by the on-board equipment even if this latter 
operates with the system version number X = 1 ordered by RBC). 
6.5.1.2 Exceptions to chapter 3 
6.5.1.2.1 Intentionally deleted. 
6.5.1.2.1.1 Clause 3.4.5.2.3 a) shall not apply.

6.5.1.2.1.4 Clause 3.5.3.7 e) shall be replaced with: “When the trackside receives the session 
established report or the information that no compatible system version is supported by 
the on-board, it shall consider the communication session established.” 
6.5.1.2.1.5 Clause 3.5.4.6 shall be replaced with: “When the trackside receives a session 
established report inside an existing communication session it shall ignore this 
message.” 
6.5.1.2.1.6 Clause 3.5.6.1.1 shall not apply. 
6.5.1.2.2 Clause 3.7.1.1 b) shall be replaced with: “When needed, limitations related to the 
movement authority, i.e. Mode profile for On Sight or Shunting and signalling related 
speed restriction (see sections 3.12.4 and 3.11.6). Mode profile and Signalling related 
Speed restriction shall always be sent together with the MA to which the information 
belongs” 
6.5.1.2.3 In clause 3.7.1.1 c), the bullet “Optionally Speed restriction to ensure a given permitted 
braking distance (see section 3.11. 11)” shall not apply.

6.6.3.4.1.6 Clause 3.18.3.10 shall not apply. 
6.6.3.4.2 Clause 3.18.4.5.4 shall be replaced with: “Only if valid Train Data is available: following 
any entry/modification of the train running number when a communication session is 
already established or following the successful establishment of a communication 
session when valid train running number is already available, the ERTMS/ETCS on-
board equipment shall send the Train Data to the RBC. 
6.6.3.4.3 Clause 3.18.4.5.4.1 shall be replaced with: “Exception: if the train running number has 
been received from the RBC, the Train Data shall not be sent back to the RBC by the 
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment. 
6.6.3.4.3.1 Requirements A33 and A34 in table 5.4.3.2 shall be replaced with: 
A33 The “SoM position report” message, marked as referring to a “valid train position referred 
to an LRBG”, shall be transmitted to the RBC. 
If already stored on-board, valid Train Data shall be transmitted to the RBC immediately 
after the “SoM position report” message. 
This condition leads to S10. 
A34 If the train position data stored in the on-board equipment is of status “invalid” and refers 
to an LRBG, the “SoM position report” message, marked as referring to an “invalid train 
position referred to an LRBG”, shall be transmitted to the RBC. 
Otherwise the "SoM position report" message, marked as referring to "no train position 
referred to an LRBG” and with the LRBG identity set to "unknown", shall be transmitted 
to the RBC. 
In both cases valid Train Data, if already stored on-board, shall be transmitted to the 
RBC immediately after the “SoM position report” message.

 6.6.5.5.1 This section applies for radio messages/packets, which are transmitted to an RBC or an 
RIU certified to the system version number X.Y = 2.2. 
6.6.5.5.2 Clause 6.6.3.4.1.2 shall apply. 
6.6.5.5.3 Clause 6.6.3.4.1.3&6 shall apply. 
6.6.5.5.4 Requirements A33&A34 in table 5.4.3.2 shall be replaced with: 
A33 The “SoM position report” message, marked as referring to a “valid train position referred 
to an LRBG”, shall be transmitted to the RBC, together with valid Train Data and/or valid 
Train running number, if already stored on-board. 
This condition leads to S10. 
A34 If the train position data stored in the on-board equipment is of status “invalid” and refers 
to an LRBG, the “SoM position report” message, marked as referring to an “invalid train 
position referred to an LRBG”, shall be transmitted to the RBC. 
Otherwise the "SoM position report" message, marked as referring to "no train position 
referred to an LRBG” and with the LRBG identity set to "unknown", shall be transmitted 
to the RBC. 
In both cases valid Train Data and/or valid Train running number, if already stored on-
board, shall be included in the “SoM position report” message. 
The process shall then go to D33 
6.6.5.5.5 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall elaborate the information to be transmitted 
to the RBC/RIU certified to system version number X = 2.2, by applying the following 
translation table to the corresponding information intended for an RBC/RIU certified to 
the system version number X.Y = 3.0. 
6.6.5.5.6 Depending on the transmitted message/packet, the action can be: 
a) data is unchanged, 
b) data is deleted (i.e. it is not sent to the receiver) 
c) data is translated, 
d) not relevant (i.e. no corresponding requirement to trigger the sending is applicable)

 7.3 Components of ERTMS/ETCS Language  
7.3.1  Introduction  
7.3.1.1  The ERTMS/ET CS language is used in transmitting information over the radio, balise 
and loop airgaps.  
7.3.1.2  The ERTMS/ETCS language is based on variables, packets, messages and telegrams 
(variables and packets are described in this section, while telegrams and messages are 
described in chapter 8).  
7.3.1.3  Note: A number of variables contain values which have to be assigned. Some of these 
values have to be unique to ensure that the system functions properly. A centralised 
handling of this assignment is therefore required (nationally o r internationally, depending 
on the variable). The variables concerned have been marked. The values included in this 
document for these variables are therefore not to be used without prior verification of 
their validity.  See SUBSET -054 for further details.  
7.3.2  Definition of Variables  
7.3.2.1  Variables are used to encode single data values. Variables cannot be split in minor units. 
The whole variable has one type (meaning).  
7.3.2.2  Variables may have special values which are related to the basic meaning of the variable.  
7.3.2.3  Special  values have always the highest values in a variable (e .g. 32767  = “unknown ”). 
7.3.2.4  Spare values are located between the normal and special values in the variable range  
7.3.2.5  Names of variables are unique. A variable is used in context with the meaning as 
described i n the variable definition. Variables with different meanings have different 
names.  
7.3.2.6  All variable definitions are independent of the transport media over which they are used, 
if used in more than one media.  
7.3.2.7  Signed values shall be encoded as 2’s complement.  
7.3.2.8  One bit variables (Boolean) always use 0 for false and 1 for true.  
7.3.2.9  Offsets for numerical values are avoided (0 is used for 0, 1 for 1, etc.) except where 
justified.  
7.3.2.10  When transmitting over the different transmission media, the most significant bit shall be 
transmitted first.  
7.3.2.11  All Variables have one of the following prefixes:

7.3.3  Definition of Packets  
7.3.3.1  Packets are multiple variables grouped into a single unit, with a defined internal structure.  
7.3.3.2  This structure consists of a packet header with:  
• Track to Train: a unique packet number, the length of the packet in bits, the 
orientation i nformation, optionally the scale for distance/length information and an 
information section containing a defined set of variables. The packet structure is as 
follows:  
Number  NID_PACKET  Packet identifier  
Direction  Q_DIR  Specifies the validity  direction of 
transmitted data  
Length  L_PACKET   Number of bits in the packet  
Scale  Q_SCALE  Specifies which scale is used for 
distance /length  information 
within the packet.  
There is no Q_SCALE variable 
in packets which do not contain 
distance information.  
Information  ...... Well defined set(s) of variables.  
• Train to Track: a unique packet number, the length of the packet in bits, optionally 
the distance scale and an information section containing a defined set of variables. 
The packet structure is as follows:  
Number  NID_PACKET  Packet identifier  
Length  L_PACKET   Number of bits in the packet  
Scale  Q_SCALE  Specifies which scale is used for 
distance /length  information 
within the packet.  
There is no Q_SCALE variable 
in packets which do not contain 
distanc e information.

 Information  ...... Well defined set(s) of variables.  
7.3.3.3  The packet definition does not change when transmitted over different transmission 
media.  
7.3.3.4  All packet identifiers not listed in 7.4.1.1 shall be considered as invalid values (i.e. like 
spare values)  when received by the on -board equipment . Exception: reception of 
information only differing by Y with regards to the highest system version number X 
supported by on -board (refer to section 3.17.3.11) . 
7.3.3.4.1  Note: Depending on the system versio n number with which the message/telegram was 
transmitted relevant exception from chapter 6 may apply regarding 7.4.1.1 . 
7.3.3.5  Exception: Packet 0 “Virtual Balise Cover marker” and Packet 255: “End of Telegram” 
do not follow the above defined structure . 
7.3.3.6  N_ITER sp ecifies the number of iterations of a variable or group of variables which follow.  
7.3.3.7  If N_ITER is 0 then no variables follow.  
7.3.3.8  Two or more nested levels of iterations can exist.  
7.3.3.9  If, depending on the value of a previous qualifier variable in the packet, a vari able is 
optional, it is written indented in the packet definition  
7.3.3.10  Row “Transmi tted by” in the description of a packet specifies which ERTMS/ETCS 
trackside device (b alise, loop, RIU, RBC) can  transmi t this packet.  “Any” means that the 
packet can be transmitted by a b alise, a loop, an RBC and a RIU . 
7.3.3.10.1  Row “Transmitted to” in the description of a packet specifies to which ERTMS/ETCS 
trackside device the packet can be transmitted.

 8.3 Introduction  
8.3.1  Scope and Purpose  
8.3.1.1  This chapter defines the format and content of  messages necessary for ERTMS/ETCS 
functions.  
8.3.1.2  Concerning the transmission media, this chapter does not cover considerations such as 
medium -specific use constraints (e .g. distance between track -circuit and balise…), as 
well as functions (e .g. detection of b alise reference, time and location stamp, identifying 
type of receiving balise, Key Management, Releasing/maintaining a radio connection…) 
and performance of the transmission media.  
8.3.2  Definitions  
8.3.2.1  Transmission media considered hereafter are standard ERTMS/ETC S transmission 
media used for ETCS  (Eurobalise, Euroradio and Euroloop).  
8.3.2.2  A message includes user data (application level) and protocol data (depending on the 
transmission medium).  
8.3.2.3  A Eurobalise message is the information sent by a balise group (i.e. the message is 
composed of one or several telegrams , sorted by balise number in the group (telegram 
from balise number 1 first), ea ch telegram is transmitted by a Eurobalise). A Eurobalise 
telegram contains one header and an identified and coherent set of Pack ets.

 8.4 Rules  
8.4.1  Common Rules  
8.4.1.1  A message (Euroradio/Euroloop) or telegram (Eurobalise) is composed of  
1. One Header,  
2. When needed, a predefined set of variables (only for Radio),  
3. When needed, a predefined set of Packets (only for Radio),  
4. Optional Packets as needed by application.  
8.4.1.2  The transmission order shall respect the order of data elements listed in the message 
format (from top to bottom).  
8.4.1.3  The behaviour of the receiver shall not depend on the sequence of the Pa ckets given by 
the message.  
8.4.1.3.1  Exception for Infill information: The locations given in the packets following packet 136 
(Infill Location Reference) shall be referred to the balise group indicated in such packet.  
8.4.1.3.2  Note: orientations are in any case always refe rred to the directionality of balise group 
(balise transmission), directionality of loop (Euroloop transmission) or directionality of 
LRBG (radio transmission).  
8.4.1.4  A track -to-train message shall contain at most one  instance of the same packet type for 
the sam e direction.  
8.4.1.4.1  Exception 1: A message can contain several packets 44 (Data used by applications 
outside the ERTMS/ETCS system).  
8.4.1.4.2  Exception 2: A message can contain several packets 65 (Temporary Speed Restriction). 
In case of  revocable TSRs, the identities of the corresponding temporary speed 
restrictions (variable NID_TSR) transmitted in the same message shall be different.  
8.4.1.4.3  Exception 3: A message can contain several packets 66 (TSR Revocation). The 
identities of the corresponding temporary speed restrictions ( variable NID_TSR) 
transmitted in the same message shall be different.  
8.4.1.4.4  Exception 4: A message transmitted by a balise group can contain one packet 136 per 
balise telegram per direction. Each packet 136 indicates which part of that telegram is to 
be consider ed as part of the infill information. Multiple packets 136 in balises of a balise 
group shall  have identical content per direction.  
8.4.1.4.5  Exception 5: A message can contain several packets 88 (Level Crossing information). 
The identities of the corresponding Leve l Crossings (variable NID_LX) transmitted in the 
same message shall be different.

 8.4.1.4.6  Exception 6: A message transmitted by a balise group can contain several packets 254 
(default balise , loop or RIU  information).  
8.4.1.4.7  Exception 7: A message transmitted by a balise  group can contain several packets 145 
(Inhibition of balise group message consistency reaction).  
8.4.1.4.8  Exception 8: A message transmitted by a balise group can contain several packets 0 
(Virtual Balise Cover marker).  
8.4.1.4.9  Exception 9: A message transmitted by a balise group can contain several packets 6 
(Virtual Balise Cover  order ). The identities (pairs of variables NID_VBCMK and NID_C) 
of the corresponding VBC transmitted in the same message shall be different.  
8.4.1.5  A train -to-track message shall co ntain at most one instance of the same packet type . 
8.4.1.5.1  Exception: A message can contain several packets 44 (Data used by applications 
outside the ERTMS/ETCS system).  
8.4.1.6  Note: For the purposes of clause 8.4.1.4, when the same packet is transmitted by 
duplicated balises, this is considered to be only a single instance of the packet within the 
message. Justification: The on -board equipment will only use one of these duplicat ed 
telegrams (and therefore only one set of duplicated packets) to compose the balise group 
message (see 3.16.2.4.8.2).

 8.4.2  Rules for Eurobalise telegrams  
8.4.2.1  The format of the telegram to be transmitted by each balise is as follows:  
 
General Format of Balise Te legram  
Field No.  VARIABLE  Length ( bits)  Remarks  
1 Q_UPDOWN  1 Defines the direction of the information:  
Down -link telegram (train to track) (0)  
Up-link telegram (track to train) (1)  
2 M_VERSION  7 Version of the ERTMS/ETCS system . 
3 Q_MEDIA  1 Defines the type of media: Balise (0)  
4  N_PIG  3 Position in the group. Defines the position of the balise in the 
balise group.  
5 N_TOTAL  3 Total number of balises in the balise group  
6 M_DUP  2 Used to indicate whether the information of the balise is a 
duplicate of the balise before or after this one.  
 
7 M_MCOUNT  8 Message counter (M_MCOUNT) - 8 bits. To enable detection 
of a change of balise group message during passage of the 
balise group.  
8 NID_C  10 Country or region.  
9 NID_BG  14 Identity of the balise group.  
10 Q_LINK  1 Marks the balise group as linked (Q_LINK = 1) or unlinked 
(Q_LINK = 0)  
 Packet 0  
(optional)  14 Virtual Balise Cover marker  
 Information  Variable  This information is composed according to the rules applicable 
for packets.  
 Packet 255  8 Finishing flag of the telegram  
 
Number of bits in balise header: 50  
 
8.4.2.2  The user information transmitted by a balise shall contain complete packets, i.e. splitting 
a packet between two balises is forbidden.  
8.4.2.3  When used, the packet 0 shall be transmitted as the first packet of the telegram (i.e. it is 
appended to the header).  
8.4.2.4  Note: If there is an active VBC stored on -board and in order to find a VBC marker, the 
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment needs first to check M_VER SION:  
• If M_VERSION = 0. Y, the telegram will be ignored;  
• If M_VERSION = 1.0, there will be no VBC marker;  
• If M_VERSION = 1.1, the on -board must look for a packet 200 (see chapter 6);  
• In all other cases (including when M_VERSION is higher than the highest sy stem 
version supported by the on -board), the on -board must look for a packet 0.

 If a packet 0 or 200 is found, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment must also check 
whether NID_C matches the VBC marker included in the packet 0 or 200. This implies 
that in all future system versions the size and location of M_VERSION and NID_C inside 
the header, the overall size of the header and the position/content of the packet 0 
appended to it, will remain invariant.  
8.4.3  Rules for Euroloop messages

 9.3 Introduction  
9.3.1  Scope and Purpose  
9.3.1.1  Chapter 9 lists a classification into categories of all the clauses in the chapters 1 to 8 of 
the SRS.  
9.3.1.2  The purpose of this chapter is to ease the assess ment  of the compliance of an 
ERTMS/ ETCS on -board equipment with the SRS.  
9.3.1.3  To that effect , this chapter comprehensively identifies  which clauses contain  
requirements allocated to the ERTMS/ ETCS on -board equipment and conversely which 
ones do not, either because they contain  requirements allocated to the ERTMS/ ETCS 
trackside only or because they are of another type . 
9.3.2  Definitions  
9.3.2.1  The following categories are used to classify each SRS clause : 
a) ERTMS/ ETCS on -board requirement : a clause containing requirement(s) that must 
be fulfilled by a SRS compliant ERTMS/ ETCS on -board  
b) ERTMS/ ETCS trackside  requirement : a clause containing requirement(s) that must 
be fulfilled by a SRS compliant ERTMS/ ETCS trackside , in case the corresponding 
function is implemented  
c) Definition : a clause that is a necessary prerequisite to the correct interpretation of 
requirement(s) or witho ut which requirement(s) cannot be unambiguously interpreted  
d) Informative : a clause that helps the reader to better understand the context or the 
justification of requirement(s)  
e) Others : a clause that does not belong to any of the above categories  
9.3.2.2  Throughout the SRS, the requirements are identified as sentences using the keyword 
“shall”. However:  
a) In section 9.4, table s are identified as a single entity through a reference based on 
the accompanying clause number. They can be classified as ERTMS/ETCS on-board 
and/or trackside requirements even if they do not include the keyword “shall”.  
b) Elements of the ERTMS/ETCS language (radio messages, packets and variables, 
see chapters 7 and 8) are also described with table s. The numbered titles (i.e. the 
name of the element preceded by a clause number) together with their associated 
table  are considered as single entities and are classified as both ERTMS/ETCS on -
board and trackside requirements, even if they do not include the keyword “shall” 
either.  
9.3.2.3  Amongst the c ategories listed in 9.3.2.1 only the two first ones can be combined , in case 
a requirement equally applies to both ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment and 
ERTMS/ETCS trackside  or in case two unambiguously distinguishable on -board and 
trackside requirements are k ept together in the concerned clause for readability reasons.
