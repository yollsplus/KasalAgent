Introduction
1.3.1.1
Train control is an important part of any railway operations management system. In the
past a number of different Automatic Train Control (ATC) systems have evolved in
different
countries
at
different
times。
These systems
are
incompatible
and
not
interoperable with each other. Only a few of these systems are used in more than one
country, and even in those cases there have been differences in detailed development
Which have resulted in incompatible and not interoperable versions。
1.3.1.2
Many railways anticipate a significant increase in density oftrain traffic and are rethinking
their infrastructure strategy, to accommodate high levels of traffic, in which ATC systems
play an important part. Also many railways Would like to introduce standardised systems
to reduce system costs。
In
order to
establish international standardisation
of ATC
systems;
the following
document specifies the European
Rail
Traffic Management
SystemlEuropean Train Control System (ERTMSIETCS).
1.4
Advantages of an International Interoperable System
1.4.1.1
The advantages expected by the railways can be summarised as:
Cross border interoperability.
Improvement of the safety of national and international train traffic。
Improvement of international passengers and freight train traffic management。
Shorter headway on heavily trafficked lines; by driving on moving block; enabling
exploitation of maximum track capacity.
The possibility of step-by-step introduction of the new technology.
Enabling Pan-European competition between the manufacturers of ERTMSIETCS
components. Strengthening the position of the European railway industry on the
World market.
Enabling
preconditions
for
future
harmonisation
in
other
areas
Of
rail
traffic
management:

About this Document
1.5.1.1
The purpose of this document is to specify the unified European Train Control System
(ETCS) from a technical point of view。
1.5.1.2
Some parts of the system are only specified to allow a migration from existing train
control
systems to ETCS (e.9. STM's) over a transition period. They might be removed
in a future edition of the standard.
1.5.1.3
To reach technical interoperability it is necessary not only that telegrams are generated
and
understood according
to
Well
specified rules
but also that
a
train respectively
trackside
equipment
reacts
in
3
uniform
Way
to
information
received.
Technical
interoperability requires specifications of a detailed level。

System structure
2.4.1.1
Due to the nature of the required functions, the ERTMSIETCS system will have to be
partly on the trackside and partly on board the trains。
2.4.1.2
This defines two subsystems, the on-board subsystem and the trackside subsystem。
2.4.1.3
The environment of ERTMSIETCS system is composed of:
a) the train
With optionally
a
Train Integrity Monitoring System,
Which
will then
be
considered in the train interface specification;
b) the driver, which will then be considered via the driver interface specification;
C) other onboard interfaces (see architecture drawing in 2.5.3);
external
trackside  systems (interlockings;
control
centres;
etc),
for
Which

Trackside subsystem
2.5.1.1
Depending on the application level (see further sections), the trackside subsystem can
be composed of:
3) balise
b) lineside electronic unit
C) the radio communication network(s) (FRMCS andlor GSM-R)
d) the Radio Block Centre (RBC)
e

2.5.1.2
Balise
2.5.1.2.1
The balise is a transmission device that can send telegrams to the on-board subsystem.
2.5.1.2.2
The balise is based on the existing Eurobalise specifications。
These documents are
included in the frame of the ERTMSIETCS specifications。
2.5.1.2.3
The balises provides the up-link, i.e. the possibility to send messages from trackside to
the on-board subsystem。
2.5.1.2.4
The balises can provide fixed messages or, when connected to a lineside electronic unit;
messages that can be changed.
2.5.1.2.5
The balises Will be organised in groups, each balise transmitting a telegram and the
combination of all telegrams defining the message sent by the balise group.
2.5.1.3
Lineside electronic unit
2.5.1.3.1
The lineside electronic units are electronic devices, that generate telegrams to be sent
by balises, on basis of information received from external trackside systems。
2.5.1.4
Trackside radio communication network(s) (FRMCS andlor GSM R)
2.5.1.4.1
The GSM-R radio communication network is used for the bi-directional exchange of
messages between on-board subsystems and RBC or radio infill units。
2.5.1.4.2
The FRMCS radio communication network is used for the bi-directional exchange of
messages between on-board subsystems and RBC.

The RBC is a computer-based system that elaborates messages to be sent to the train
On
basis of information received from
external trackside systems and
On

2.5.1.5.2
The main objective of these messages is to provide movement authorities to allow the
safe movement of trains on the Railway infrastructure area under the responsibility of the
RBC.
2.5.1.5.3
The interoperability requirements for the RBC are mainly related to the data exchange

Levels and transitions
2.6.1
Introduction
2.6.1.1
The different ERTMSIETCS application levels (short: levels) are a Way to express the
possible operating relationships between track and train. Level definitions are related to
the trackside equipment used, to the way trackside information reaches the on-board
units
and to
Which functions
are processed
in the trackside
and
in
the on-board
equipment respectively.
2.6.1.2
Different levels have been defined to allow each individual railway administration to
select the appropriate ERTMSIETCS application trackside, according to their strategies;
to
their trackside infrastructure
and
to the required performance。
Furthermore;
the
different application levels permit the interfacing of individual signalling systems and train
control systems to ERTMSIETCS.
2.6.1.3
For the purpose of a consistent specification a level 0 has been defined. This level is
used for operation on non-equipped (unfitted) lines or on lines equipped with train control
system(s) but operation under their supervision is currently not possible。
2.6.2
Definitions
2.6.2.1
train equipped with ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment always co-operates With the
ERTMSIETCS trackside equipment in a defined ERTMSIETCS level。
2.6.2.2
AIItransitions between levels are performed according to well-specified rules。
2.6.2.3
ERTMSIETCS can be configured to operate in one of the following application levels:
ERTMSIETCS Level 0 (train equipped with ERTMSIETCS operating on a line not
equipped with any train control system (ERTMSIETCS or national system) oron a
line equipped with ERTMSIETCS andlor national system(s) but operation under their
supervision is currently not possible)
ERTMSIETCS
Level NTC (train equipped with ERTMSIETCS operating
on a line
equipped with a national system)
ERTMSIETCS Application Level
with or Without infill transmission (train equipped
With ERTMSIETCS operating
On
3
line equipped with Eurobalises and optionally
Euroloop or Radio infill)
ERTMSIETCS Application Level 2 (train equipped with ERTMSIETCS operating on a
line controlled by a Radio Block Centre and equipped with Eurobalises and Euroradio)
with train detection and train separation performed by the Radio Block Centre based
on information received from the train andlor by other trackside equipment outside
the scope of ERTMSIETCS

It is possible to superimpose several application levels in parallel on the same track, for
example parallel operation of a line with a national system and with ERTMSIETCS level

2.6.3
ERTMSIETCS Application Level 0
2.6.3.1
General description
2.6.3.1.1
Level 0 covers operation of ETCS equipped trains on lines not equipped with ETCS or
national systems or on lines where trackside ERTMSIETCS infrastructure andlor national
systems may exist but operation under their supervision is currently not possible (e.9.
commissioning or on-boardltrackside failed components).
2.6.3.1.2
In Level 0 it is authorized to operate trains without any train control system and therefore
line
Side optical signals
Or
other
means
Of signalling
are
Used
to give movement
authorities to the driver。
2.6.3.1.3
ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment provides no supervision except of the maximum
design speed of a train and maximum speed permitted in unfitted areas。
2.6.3.1.4
Train detection and train separation are performed by the trackside equipment of the
underlying signalling system (interlocking, track circuits etc. ) and are outside the scope
of ERTMSIETCS.
2.6.3.1.5
Level 0 uses no track-train transmission except Eurobalises to announcelcommand level
transitions。
Eurobalises therefore still have to be read.
No balise data except certain
special commands are interpreted.
2.6.3.1.6
No supervisory information is indicated on the DMI except the train speed. Train data
has to be entered in order not to have to stop a train at a level transition to ERTMSIETCS
equipped area and to supervise maximum train speed.

ERTMSIETCS Application Level NTC
2.6.4.1
General description
2.6.4.1.1
Level NTC is used to run ERTMSIETCS equipped trains on lines equipped with national
train control and speed supervision systems。
2.6.4.1.2
Train control information generated trackside by the national train control system is
transmitted to the train via the communication
channels of the underlying national
system。
2.6.4.1.3
Note: Lineside optical signals might be necessary or not, depending on the performance
and functionality of the underlying systems。
2.6.4.1.4
Intentionally deleted。
2.6.4.1.5
The achievable level of supervision is similar to the one provided by the underlying
national systems。
2.6.4.1.6
Train detection and train separation are performed by the trackside equipment of the
underlying signalling system (interlocking, track circuits etc ) and are outside the scope
of ERTMSIETCS.
2.6.4.1.7
Level NTC uses no ERTMSIETCS track-train information except to announcelcommand
level transitions
and specific commands related to
balise transmission。
Eurobalises
therefore still have to be read.
2.6.4.1.8
The information displayed to the driver depends on the functionality of the underlying
national system。
The active national system is indicated to the driver as
Of that
information. Full train data has to be entered in order not to have to stop a train at a level
transition position and to supervise maximum train speed。
2.6.4.1.9
combination ofnational systems can be regarded as one NTC level.
2.6.4.1.10
Depending on the functionality and the configuration of the specific national system
installed onboard, the ERTMSIETCS Onboard system may need to be interfaced to it,in
order to perform the transitions fromlto the national system andlorin order to give access
to ERTMSIETCS Onboard resources (e.9. DMI). This can be achieved through a device
called an STM (Specific Transmission Module) using a standardised interface.

ERTMSIETCS Application Level 1
2.6.5.1
General description
2.6.5.1.1
ERTMSIETCS Level
is a
Spot transmission based train control system to be used as
an overlay on an underlying signalling system。
2.6.5.1.2
Movement authorities are generated trackside
and
are transmitted to the train
Via
Eurobalises。
2.6.5.1.3
ERTMSIETCS Level
provides a continuous speed supervision system, Which also
protects against overrun of the authority.
2.6.5.1.4
Train detection and train separation are performed by the trackside equipment of the
underlying signalling system (interlocking, track circuits etc. ) and are outside the scope
of ERTMSIETCS。
2.6.5.1.5
Level
is based on Eurobalises as spot transmission devices。
2.6.5.1.6
The trackside equipment does not know the train to Which it sends information。
2.6.5.1.7
Ifin level 1a lineside signal clears, an approaching train can not receive this information
until it passes the Eurobalise group at that signal. The driver therefore has to observe
the lineside signal to know When to proceed。
The train
has then to
be permitted to
approach the stopping location below a maximum permitted release speed。
2.6.5.1.8
Additional Eurobalises can be placed between distant and main signals to transmit infill
information, the train will receive new information before reaching the signal。
2.6.5.1.9
Note: Lineside signals are required in level
applications, except if semi-continuous infill
is provided.
2.6.5.1.10
Semi-continuous infill can be provided using Euroloop or radio infill. In this case, the on-
board system will be able to show new information to the driver as soon as it is available
and even at standstill。
2.6.5.1.11
Euroloop
Or radio infill can improve the safety of a level
1
system as they allow the
operation without release speed。

Introduction
3.3.1
Scope and purpose
3.3.1.1
The chapter 3,
Principles; specifies the system principles
of ETCSIERTMS.
These
principles apply to on-board and trackside subsystems。
3.3.1.2
The principles define the operational and technical behaviour of the system in general
and functional terms.
3.3.1.3
The
chapter
is
divided
into
subchapters。
In
each subchapter
normally
Several
requirements are defined。
Each requirement is identified with
3
unique identification
number。
3.3.1.4
Notes, Justifications and Examples are only informative and shall not be regarded as
requirements:
3.4
Balise configuration, linking and Euroloop
3.41
Balise Configurations
Balise Group Definition
3.4.1.1
balise group consists of between one and eight balises sharing the same balise group
identity.
3.4.1.2
In every balise, the following information is at least stored:
a) The internal number (from
to 8) of the balise
b) The number of balises inside the group
The balise group identity.
3.4.1.3
The internal number of the balise describes the relative position ofthe balise in the group.
3.4.2
Balise Co-ordinate System
3.4.2.1.1
Every balise group has its own co-ordinate system。
3.4.2.1.2
The orientation of the co-ordinate system of a
balise group is defined by the nominal
direction (see 3.4.2.2.2) and is identified as balise group orientation.
3.4.2.2
Balise groups composed of tWo or more balises
3.4.2.2.1
The origin of the co-ordinate system for each balise group is given by the balise number
(called location reference) in the balise group.
3.4.2.2.1.1 Exception: If the balise number
of the group is duplicated, the balise number 2 shall be
the location reference in case, out of this
of duplicated balises, the ERTMSIETCS
on-board equipment has only received the telegram from the balise number 2

more balises (with "inherent" co-ordinate system)
3.4.2.3.3
Assignment of the co-ordinate system by means of a dialogue between the on
board and the RBC:
3.4.2.3.3.1
If the ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment cannot evaluate the orientation of the last
balise group received, being a single balise group, i.e. no linking information is available
to identify the orientation of the co-ordinate system of this single balise group, the
ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment shall report its position by means of a position report
based on two balise groups reporting the train position in reference to the LRBG and the
"previous LRBG", ifany。
3.4.2.3.3.1.1
Note: Receiving this type of position report advises the RBC of the need to assign a
co-ordinate system to this single balise group。
3.4.2.3.3.2 When a single balise group is received and the previous LRBG is known, the position
report based on two balise groups shall use as direction reference a
move from the
"previous LRBG" towards this single balise group (being the
new LRBG): directional
information in the position report pointing in the same direction as the direction reference
shall be reported as "nominal , otherwise as "reverse"
3.4.2.3.3.3 Ifthe "previous LRBG
is not known, the "previous LRBG'
and all directional information
of the position report based on two balise groups shall be reported as "unknown".
3.4.2.3.3.4
If a
new single balise group (BG2), different from the current LRBG (861), becomes
LRBG While the running direction of the train is opposite to the running direction when
this current LRBG (861)
Was last passed, the "previous LRBG" and

3.4.2.3.3.6 The assignment of a co-ordinate system received from the RBC shall identify the balise
group for Which the assignment is given, and shall assign a balise group orientation
"nominal"
Or "reverse" to this balise group relative to the on-board direction reference
reported in the position report based on two balise groups (see 3.4.2.3.3.2)

Balise Information Types and Usage
3.4.3.1
In
level
1 ,
all information
to
the on-board system
is given from
balise groups
Or
additionally from Euroloops or Radio Infill Units (see section 3.9). In level 2, balise groups
are mostly used for location information.
3.4.3.2
In level
1
the balise information can be of the following type (please refer to sections
3.6.2.3 and 3.8.5):
a) Non-infill
b) Intentionally deleted
Infill.
3.4.3.2.1
Intentionally deleted。
3.4.3.2.2

Linking
3.4.4.1
Introduction
3.4.4.1.1
Aim of linking:
To determine Whether a
balise group has been missed or not received within the
expectation Window (see section 3.4.4.4) and take the appropriate action。
To assign a co-ordinate system to balise groups consisting of a single balise。
To perform the relocation of location based information without any consideration of
the odometer inaccuracy (see section 3.6.4)
3.4.4.1.2
balise group is linked when its linking information (see section 3.4.4.2) is known in
advance.
3.4.4.1.2.1
Note: In cases Where a balise group contains repositioning information, the term linked
also applies since the
balise group
is announced,
marked
as linked
and contains
repositioning information marked accordingly.
3.4.4.2
Content of linking information
3.4.4.2.1
Linking information shall be composed of:
a) The identity of the linked balise group.
b) Where the location reference of the group is。
The accuracy Of this location。

Note: If the reference balise is duplicated, it is the trackside responsibility to define
the location accuracy to cover at least the location of the two duplicated balises。
The direction With Which the linked balise group will be passed over (nominal or
reverse)
The reaction required f a
data consistency problem
OCCUrs with the linked balise
group。
3.4.4.2.1.1 "Linking consistency is checked" shall be interpreted as when:
a) linking information is stored on-board, AND
b) depending on the mode the linking consistency check is active; AND
the supervision of the expectation window of the furthest announced balise group has
not yet been stopped (see 3.4.4.4.6)
3.4.4.2.2
Instead of the identity of a linked balise group it shall be possible to identify a following
linked balise group as unknown but containing repositioning information.

3.4.4.2.2.2 Note 1: Regarding the repositioning information, see chapter 3.8.5.3.5 and 3.8.5.2.
3.4.4.2.2.3 Note 2: In case the identity ofthe next balise group is not unambiguously known because
the route is not known by the trackside; this feature allows to link this balise group.
3.4.4.2.3
For each linked balise group, the trackside shall select one of the following reactions to
be used in case of data inconsistencies:
a) Train trip (Trip mode; see Chapter 4)
b) Command service brake

Managing the Radio Networks
3.5.6.1
ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment shall order the registration of its connected GSM-R
Mobile Terminal(s) to a GSM-R Radio Network:
a) At power-up
b) Following driver entry of a new GSM-R Radio Network identity
If ordered from the trackside
3.5.6.1.1
In order to manage the transitions between different Radio Networks, the trackside can
transmit Radio Network transition orders, Which include:
3) The Radio Network type (FRMCS, FRMCS+GSM-R,or GSM-R)
b) Only 讦 the
Radio Network type is FRMCS+GSM-Ror GSM-R,
the GSM-R
Radio
Network identity
3.5.6.1.2
Note 1: Unlike the GSM-R Radio Networks, the FRMCS Radio Network can be seen by
ETCS as
one single entity without the need for ETCS to order the registration of its
connected FRMCS on-board equipment to the FRMCS Radio Network or to manage the
transitions between networks, Which permits e.9. to not interrupt a radio connection on
passing an international border where FRMCS is installed on both sides of the border。
3.5.6.1.3
Note
2:
As
Soon

powered-up;
the
FRMCS
on-board
equipment reports
continuously to the ETCS on-board equipment whether it is registered or not to the
FRMCS radio network, i.e. that it is ready or not to establish a radio connection with an
RBC.
3.5.6.2
When powered-off, ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment shall memorize the last received
Radio Network type and GSM-R Radio Network identity if any (from trackside or from
driver) and shall use it (them) when powered-up again。
3.5.6.3
If no GSM-R Radio Network identity received from trackside or from driver could have
been memorized by ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment (e.9. after a System Failure or
at Very first power-up), this latter shall nevertheless order the registration of its Mobile
Terminal(s) to a default GSM-R Radio Network。
3.5.6.3.1
Note 1: the source used to retrieve the default GSM-R Radio Network identity (on-board
equipment permanent storage;
Mobile
Terminal itself,
Or
other
external source) is
implementation dependent。
3.5.6.3.2
Note 2: x ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment is powered-up in an area not covered by
the memorized
Or default GSM-R
Radio Network, attempts to register to this
Radio
Network will be repeated unconditionally by the Mobile Terminal(s) until either an attempt
is SUccessful or a new GSM-R Radio Network identity is received from trackside or from
driver, preventing Mobile Terminal(s) from registering to any unwanted GSM-R Radio
Network。

eVen
though the route might be set through a complex track layout.
Figure 6: Actual route of the train
Figure 7: Route known by the train
3.6.1.3
The Train Position information defines the position of the train front in relation to
a
reference balise group, Which is called LRBG (the Last Relevant Balise Group) in case
the balise group is marked as linked and may be used for reporting the train position to
the RBC (i.e.the balise group is LRBG compliant;, see 3.6.2.2.2a)), andlor in relation to
other reference
balise groups,
Which
are
called
ORBGs (Other
Reference
Balise
Groups).
It includes for each of the reference balise groups (LRBGIORBGs):
The estimated train front end position, defined by the estimated distance between the
LRBGIORBG and the front end of the train
The train position confidence interval (see 3.6.4.1)
Directional train position information in reference to the balise group orientation (see
3.4.2,also Figure 14) of the LRBGIORBG, regarding:
the position
of the
train
front

Side
Of
the

the train orientation
the train running direction
The ORBGs are at least the seven previous LRBGs last reported to the RBC, Which
may alternatively be used by trackside for referencing location dependent information
(see 3.6.2.2.2C)), the balise groups used as reference by information stored in any
of the transition buffers (see section 4.8), and either the last passed balise group
marked as unlinked or the last two passed balise groups marked as unlinked if there
is no balise group marked as linked in between.
3.6.1.3.1
Note: the train position information in relation to an ORBG is necessary to relocate all
location based information to the Single On-board Location Reference (SOLR), in case
no linking distance can be used (see section 3.6.4.2).

Train Position Confidence Interval
3.6.4.1.1
The confidence interval to the train position refers to the distance to the reference balise
group and takes into account
a) On-board over-reading amount and under-reading amount;
Which include among
other things the odometer accuracy and the
error in detection of the balise group

b) The location accuracy of the reference balise group
3.6.4.1.2
Note: The confidence interval increases in relation to the distance travelled from the
reference balise group depending on the accuracy of odometer equipment。

The Value of the Location Accuracy shall be determined by Linking information When i
becomes available; or, xf it has not been previously determined by Linking information
When the balise group becomes LRBG or ORBG, by the corresponding National Value

clauses in the ETCS specifications using them
3.6.4.2.4.1
Note 1: an individual location based information can be classified as several types of
location items。
For example,
the EOA location is an "estimated" location item to define
SBD foot, a "min" location item to provoke entry into Trip mode and a "max" location item
x t defines the Svl. As a second example;
a
single TSR encompasses two location
items; i.e.
a "max'
location item at its start location and a "min" location item at its end
location.
Classification of TSR location item;
35
true for any Speed Restriction,
is
indirectly deduced from the fact that V_MRSP is obtained with the min safe front end and
the max safe front end of the train as per clause 3.13.10.2.8.
3.6.4.2.4.2 Note 2: in general (but not necessarily for all the functions ), an "estimated"("min"("max"
location item is used to apply a clause when this latter involves a comparison against the
estimated front end positionlmin safe rear end position or the min safe antenna positionl
max safe front end position or the max safe antenna position.
3.6.4.2.4.3 Note 3: as long as linking distance(s) can be used to perform the relocation,
SeVeral
items associated to a given location based information will be referred with the same
distance to the SOLR by the on-board. Otherwise, these location items (e.9. "min",
"estimated" and "max"
MA section ends) will be referred to the SOLR
With different
distances, after a relocation as per clause 3.6.4.2.5b) orc) has taken place.

When a balise group becomes the SOLR or when evaluating (see section 4.8) location
based trackside information, Which is referred to a balise group different from the SOLR,
every location item shall be relocated to the SOLR by subtracting from the distance to its
former reference balise group (FRBG):
a) the distance between the FRBG and the SOLR, retrieved from linking information if it
is available and known (i.e. no linking distance to a repositioning balise group being
encountered between these balise groups) and, s any, the last relocation Of this
location item has not been performed as per clause 3.6.4.2.5c), OR
b) if the last relocation of this location item has been performed as per clause 3.6.4.2.5
C) towards a BG not received earlier than the reference BG of this location item, the

available and known (i.e。
no linking distance to a repositioning balise group being

in all other cases, the estimated, min or max travelled distance between the FRBG
and the SOLR, computed as per clauses 3.6.1.3 and 3.6.4.1.5 from train front end

(estimated front end position against FRBG
estimated front end position
against SOLR) for "estimated" location items,
(min safe front end position against FRBG
min safe front end position against
SOLR) for "min" location items,
(max safe front end position against FRBG -
max safe front end position against
SOLR) for "max" location items.
3.6.4.2.5.1
Note 1: For infill information or when evaluating information from a balise group marked
as unlinked while linking consistency is checked, the distances used for relocation will
always be negative and Will result in an increase of the supervised distances to the
location items (because they are relocated back to the SOLR):
3.6.4.2.5.2 Note 2: The FRBG can be the former SOLR, a balise group that does not become the
SOLR (e.9.an unlinked balise group while linking consistency is checked ), a balise group
that has transmitted information that has been stored in the transition buffer, the LRBG
used in an RBC message oran infill location reference.
3.6.4.2.5.3 Note 3: AlI reference balise groups that are used in clause 3.6.4.2.5 are listed in Train
Position defined in 3.6.1.3. Furthermore, the list of the location items that Was relocated
as per clause 3.6.4.2.5 C) needs also to be memorised to apply this clause 3.6.4.2.5.
3.6.4.2.5.4
Note 4: By principle;
the relocation from former SOLR to new SOLR done by clause
3.6.4.2.5 c) has no effect on the supervision of the location items, because the same

3.6.4.2.5.5 Note 5: The supervision of distances on-board Will always be safe using these rules,
together with the SUBSET-O40 84.6.1.1 rule as prerequisite. If the trackside wants to
increase the performance, i is its responsibility to provide linking in due course or to

Step 2:
From the end location to the start location of each "reverted" element(s)

shall retain the lowest parts of the overlapping elements obtained from step 1;
Step 3: The clause 3.6.4.2.3 shall be applied to the profile obtained from step 2,

that the TSR location items are relocated on it: despite linking distance is available between
BG1and 8G2, the relocation of the TSR location items is neither performed by clause
3.6.4.2.5a nor by clause 3.6.4.2.5b, as the last relocation of the TSR location items has been
performed by clause 3.6.4.2.5c to a balise group, which was received earlier than the former
reference balise group of the TSR location items; SO:
the absolute Value of the difference between the max safe front end positions against
BG1and against 8G2 is subtracted from D_TSR ("max'
location item)
the absolute Value of the difference between the min safe front end positions against
861
and
against 8G2 is subtracted from (D_TSR + L_TSR) ("min" location item).
Each location iem has to be handled independently。
This example only covers the TSR
location items。
Srd relocation: When the ERTMSIETCS on-board reads 8G3, i becomes the new SOLR, So
that the TSR location items are relocated on i: linking distance is available between 8G2 and
BG3 and it is used for the relocation of the TSR location items, as the last relocation of the TSR
location items has been performed by clause 3.6.4.2.5c but not towards a balise group received
earlier than the former reference balise group of the TSR location items; So:
the
linking distance between 8G2 and 8G3, retrieved from linking information and
augmented by twice the location accuracy of 862, is subtracted from D
TSR
the linking distance between 8G2 and 8G3, retrieved from linking information and
diminished by twice the location accuracy of 8G2,is subtracted from (D_TSR
LTSR):
4th relocation: When the ERTMSIETCS on-board reads BG4
i becomes the new SOLR, So
that the TSR location items are relocated on it: linking distance is available between 863 and
BG4and it is used as such for the relocation of the TSR location items, as the last relocation of
the TSR location items has not been performed by clause 3.6.4.2.5c, So:
the linking distance between B63 and BG4, retrieved from linking information, is
subtracted from D_TSR
the linking distance between BG3 and 8G4, retrieved from linking information, is
subtracted from (D_TSR
LTSR)

The balise group BG;is still the LRBG and SOLR when the on-board performs the

The linking information Which Was stored in the transition buffer
does not announce this BGi but BGI that therefore becomes the new SOLR.
Then the location items of the MA also released from the transition buffer (referred to
balise group BGc) are relocated to BG1 prior to its evaluation, through this linking
information:
The first MA Section end is relocated by subtracting D_LINK (1) from MA Section
(1) length, to obtain the distance from the SOLR to the MA section (1') end
The second MA Section end is relocated by subtracting D_LINK (1) from MA
Section (1) length
MA Section (2) length, to obtain the distance from the SOLR
to the MA section (2') end
Although the balise group BG; is the LRBG, the on-board uses the train position
confidence interval VS
BG1 to supervise the MA,
as itis the SOLR

Report of train integrity information
3.6.5.2.1
The confirmation of train integrity may be given by external source or by driver. For the
ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment, the confirmation of train integrity means that the
train length stored as Valid Train Data or the safe consist length at the time the train Was
last known to be integer can be used for reporting the train position to the RBC, which
will allow the trackside to use the information about the confirmed train rear end position。
3.6.5.2.2
Driver input of train integrity confirmation shall only be permitted at standstill.
3.6.5.2.3
The train integrity information reported to the RBC shall consist of:

Train integrity confirmed by external source
Train integrity confirmed by driver

3.6.5.2.4.1
Note: When a confirmation of integrity is received from an external source, this does not
necessarily
mean that the train is complete at the
moment that the confirmation is
received, but rather that the train Was known to be complete at some time before the

Table 2c: Transition conditions for the train integrity status information to be reported to
the RBC
3.6.5.2.6
Following the successful establishment of a communication session with an RBC, the
train integrity status information to be reported to this RBC shall initially be set to
integrity information" and the conditions of the table 2c shall be evaluated before sending
the first position report。
3.6.5.2.7
Note: As long as no train length is available (captured as valid Train Data or derived from
the safe consist length information when no valid Train Data is available) or as long as
the train position is not valid or not referred to an LRBG, the ERTMSIETCS on-board
equipment cannot report that the train integrity is confirmed, regardless of the train
integrity information received from an external source. Justification: in order to calculate
the confirmed train length when reporting a train integrity confirmation, the train position
must be valid and referred to an LRBG and the train length must be available at the time
Of the train integrity confirmation。
3.6.5.2.8
Note: In order to keep the sending rate of position reports as requested by the RBC, the
confirmation of train integrity by an external source does not trigger itself any position
report. It is only in the first position report following the last confirmation of train integrity
that such confirmation by external source can be reported. The difference between the
confirmed train length and the train length will then grow to an extent depending on both
the frequency of the train integrity confirmation and the position report sending rate。
3.6.5.2.9
Note: When the information "Train integrity lost" is received,
the train integrity status
information is reported in every position report following the detection of the loss of train
integrity, until the train integrity is confirmed again, or until the information "Train integrity

a) The End of Movement Authority is the location to which the train is authorised to move。
b) When the Target Speed at the
End of
Movement Authority is zero, the
End of
Movement Authority is called EOA (End of Authority); when the target speed is not
Zero, it is called the LOA (Limit of Authority).
This non zero target speed can be time
limited.
C)
忏
no overlap exists,
the Danger Point is a location beyond the
End of Movement
Authority that can
be reached by the front end of the train Without a
risk for
a
hazardous situation。
d) The end of an overlap (if used in the existing interlocking system) is a location beyond
orat the End of Movement Authority that can be reached by the front end of the train
without a risk fora
hazardous situation.
This additional distance beyond the End of
Movement Authority is only valid for a defined time.

can be associated with the Danger Point, and another one with the overlap. Release
speed can also be calculated on-board the train (see section 3.13.9.3.6.5).
The MA can be split into several sections, The last one is called End Section.
first time-out Value can be attached to each section. This Value will be used for
the revocation of the associated route when the train has not entered into 计
It is
called the Section time-out:
In addition, a second time-out value can be attached to the End Section of the MA.
This second time-out will be Used for the revocation of the last section When i is
occupied by the train; it is called the End Section time-out。
3.8.1.2
The values of the time-outs possibly given in an
MA shall take into account the time
elapsed from the start of validity of information to the sending of the message。
3.8.1.3
Note: A
Danger Point can be (not exhaustive list):
the entry point of an occupied block section (if the line is operated according to fixed
block principles)
the position of the last confirmed rear end ofa train i.e. the position deduced from the
confirmed train length information contained in a position report confirming the train
integrity (if the line is operated according to moving block principles)
the fouling point of
3
Switch, positioned for
3
route; conflicting
with the current
direction of movement of the train (both for fixed and moving block mode of operation)
3.8.1.4
Note: Traditionally the overlap is a piece of track (beyond the danger point), that is put
at disposal of a train, to guarantee a
non hazardous situation, also in case the driver
should misjudge the stopping distance for the train. In ERTMSIETCS the overlap can be
used to improve the efficiency of the braking supervision。
3.8.1.5
Note: Time-out Values can
be given in the
MA to cope with the following situations
depending on the interlocking operations; i.e.
the timers on-board will only reflect the
situation trackside and when expired (on-board) the actions taken are restrictive:
a) Section time-out or time-out for the speed at the LOA: When a signalman requests a
route release of a part of a route not yet entered by the approaching train.
b) End
Section time-out:
When the train
has
entered
the last part of a
route
the
automatic route release can be delayed to make sure that the train has come to a
standstill before any switches inside the route can be moved.
Time-out foran overlap: When the train has entered the last partof a route, the overlap
associated with the route remains Valid for a certain time to make sure that the train
has successfully stopped before its End of Movement Authority. If the overlap is still
unoccupied when the timer expires the interlocking revokes the overlap:
3.8.1.6
Note: If the trackside equipment does not have enough information to give the distance
to the End of Movement Authority with a target speed equal to Zero, a target speed higher
than zero can be given (LOA, Limit of Authority). It is the responsibility of the trackside
to ensure that the safe distance beyond the LOA is long enough to brake the train from

3.8.4.1
End Section Time Out
3.8.4.1.1
The End Section timer shall be started on-board when the train passes the End Section
timer start location given by trackside with its max safe front end.
3.8.4.1.2
When the End Section timer value becomes greater than the time-out value given by
trackside, the following shall apply:
a) The EOAILOA shall be withdrawn to the current position of the train. Refer to appendix
A.3.4 forthe exhaustive list of location based information stored on-board, Which shall
be deleted accordingly;
b) ffany, a non zero target speed value at the End of Movement Authority shall be set to
Zero (i.e。
an LOA at the End of Movement Authority becomes an EOA withdrawn to
the current position of the train).
3.8.4.1.3
In case no End Section timer is running when the on-board receives a new MA with an
End Section timer start location in rear of the max Safe front end of the train, the on-
board shall consider that the End Section timer value became greater than its time-out
Value and apply 3.8.4.1.2.
3.8.4.1.3.1
Justification: in this case the train is already beyond the timer start location, therefore i
is impossible to determine when that location Was crossed and so What share of the time-
out Value has elapsed since the crossing event. The safe assumption is to consider that
the time-out value has been exceeded and therefore that the End Section will soon be
released by the Interlocking.
3.8.4.1.4
In casean End Section timer is already running When the on-board receives a new MA
with an End Section timer start location in rear of the max safe front end of the train, the
on-board shall keep the End Section timer running but replace the time-out value with
the Value received with the new MA.

Justification: this allows repetition of the MA via RBC (e.9. acknowledgment of current
MA was lost) without unintentionally affecting the End Section timer。
3.8.4.2
Section Time Outs
3.8.4.2.1
For each section, the on-board shall consider a Section timer that has started:
a) For Level 2: at the value of the time stamp of the message including the MA.
b) For Level
1: at the time of passage over the first encountered balise of the balise
group giving the MA。
3.8.4.2.1.1 Justification for b): This is to ensure that the timeris always started before or at the same
time as the related variable information is received. Thus the timer start is independent
ofin Which balise the variable information is given。
3.8.4.2.2
When a Section timer value becomes greater than the time-out value given by trackside;
the following shall apply unless an MA shortening has occurred With A.3.4.1.3 condition
[11] applied:
a) the EOALOA and the SvL shall be withdrawn to the entry pointof the revoked section.
Refer to appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of location based information stored
on-board, which shall be deleted
accordingly;
b) the Nationall Default Value of the Release Speed shall apply
i any, a non zero target speed value at the End of Movement Authority shall be set to
zero (i.e.an LOA at the End of Movement Authority becomes an EOA withdrawn to
the entry point of the revoked section).
3.8.4.2.2.1
Justification: Applying
3.8.4.2.2
While
the
ERTMSIETCS
on-board
equipment
has
considered the current estimated front end and max safe front end positions, as the EOA
and
SvL respectively,
with
00
Release Speed, could lead
to inappropriate system
behaviour such as the EOA being moved in advance of the current one orin the sudden
supervision ofa Release Speed allowing the train to move forward。
3.8.4.2.3
The Section timer shall be stopped when the min safe front end of the train has passed
the associated Section timer stop location。
3.8.4.2.4
In case of reverse movement which brings back the min safe front end of the train in rear
of a Section timer stop location after the Section timer has been stopped according to
3.8.4.2.3, the on-board shall consider that the Section timer value became greater than
its tme-out value and shall apply 3.8.4.2.2 once the train has reached standstill.
3.8.4.2.5
If, upon its evaluation, a new MA includes a section with its timer stop location already in
rear of the min Safe front end of the train, the on-board shall consider that the Section
timer had been stopped before its value could become greater than its time-out Value
and shall not apply 3.8.4.2.2.
3.8.4.2.5.1
Justification: in this case the train is already beyond the timer stop location, therefore i
is impossible to determine When that location was crossed and so What share of the time-
out
Value
has  elapsed
before
the crossing
event。 Knowing

3.8.4.3
Time-out of the speed associated with the End of Movement Authority (LOA speed
tme out)
3.8.4.3.1
For the LOA speed, the on-board shall consider a timer that has started:
a) For Level 2: at the value of the time stamp of the message including the MA.
b) For Level
1: at the time of passage over the first encountered balise of the balise
group giving the MA。
3.8.4.3.1.1 Justification for b): This is to ensure that the timeris always started before or at the same
time as the related variable information is received. Thus the timer start is independent
ofin Which balise the variable information is given。
3.8.4.3.2
When the LOA speed timer value becomes greater than the time-out value given by
trackside, the speed associated With the LOA shall be set to
Zero (i.e。
the Limit of
Authority becomes an End of Authority and the SvL is defined on-board according to
3.8.4.5).
Refer to appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of location based information
stored on-board, Which shall be deleted accordingly.
3.8.4.4
Time-out of Overlap
3.8.4.4.1
The Overlap timer shall be started on-board when the train passes the Overlap timer
start location given by trackside with its max safe front end. The timer shall be considered
as started even 讦 a time-out value "infinite" is given。
3.8.4.4.2
When
the Overlap timer
Value
becomes greater than the
time-out Value given
by
trackside, the following shall apply:
a) the
overlap
information
shall
be
deleted
and
the Supervised

Shall
be
determined in accordance with 3.8.4.5. Refer to appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list
of location based information stored on-board, Which shall be deleted accordingly.
b) the release speed associated with the Overlap shall be deleted
讦
a non zero target speed value at the End of Movement Authority shall be set to
Zero (i.e.an LOA at the End of Movement Authority becomes an EOA).
3.8.4.4.3
If the train comes to a standstill after the Overlap timer has been started, the on-board
Shall consider that the Overlap timer value became greater than its time-out value and
shall apply 3.8.4.4.2.
3.8.4.4.4
In Case
no Overlap timer is running When the on-board receives a
new MA
with
an
Overlap timer start location in rear of the max safe front end of the train, the on-board

3.8.4.4.5
In case an Overlap timer is already running when the on-board receives a new MA with
an
Overlap timer start location in rear of the max safe front end of the train, the on-board
shall keep the Overlap tmer running but replace the Overlap time-out value With the
Value received with the new MA.
3.8.4.4.5.1 Justification: this allows repetition of the MA via RBC (e.9. acknowledgment of current
MA was lost) Without unintentionally affecting the Overlap timer。
3.8.4.5
Supervised Location
3.8.4.5.1
Unless stated otherwise, the Supervised Location (SvL) shall be defined on-board as:
a) the end of overlap (if any and before time-out):
b) x not, the Danger Point (ifany).
C)
i not; the end of the End Section.
3.8.4.5.2
As long as a Limit Of Authority is supervised, no SvL shall be defined on-board。
3.8.4.6
Infill MA (level
1
only)
3.8.4.6.1
An MA given by an infill device is called an infill MA。
3.8.4.6.2
An infill MA shall be evaluated on-board only i the on-board equipment is in FS, AD or
LS mode:
3.8.4.6.3
The infill information shall include the identity of the balise group at the next main signal
i.e. the identity of the balise group giving the information that is transmitted in advance
by the infill device.
3.8.4.6.4
Aninfill MA shall be evaluated on-board only if the linking information, regarding the main
signal balise group to Which it refers, is available。
3.8.4.6.5
The on-board shall start a Section timer for each section beyond the next main signal:
8) When the infill information is received from a balise group at the time of passing the
first encountered balise of the infill balise group。
b) When the infill information is received from a loop at the time of receiving the loop
message。
C)
When the infill information is received from a radio infill unit at the value of the time
stamp of the radio infill message including the MA.

3.8.5.1.1
Note: This refers to all information included in the MA as listed in section 3.8.1.1and the
Signalling related speed restriction (see section 3.11.6).
3.8.5.1.2
When an infill MA is received, the on-board shall start a
new MA section at the infill
location reference; i.e. the balise group at the next main signal (see 3.6.2.3.1.
3.8.5.1.3
If the SvL defined from the new MA is closer than the one supervised with the former
MA, this shall be considered by the on-board equipment as an MA shortening. Refer to
appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of location based information stored on-board,
Which shall be deleted accordingly.
3.8.5.1.4
Ifa new MA defines an SvL while the on-board was supervising an LOA, this shall always
be considered by the on-board equipment as an MA shortening regardless of the SvL
location.
Refer to appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of location based information
stored on-board, Which shall be deleted accordingly.
3.8.5.1.5
On reception of a shortened MA sent together with other location based information, the
deletion of information referred to in the clauses 3.8.5.1.3 and 3.8.5.1.4 shall apply to the
information stored on-board prior to the reception of this trackside information, before
any clause dealing with the replacement of information (e.9. 3.7.3.1
Or 3.18.2.9 first
bullet) is applied。
3.8.5.2
It shall be possible to update the length of an MA section by means of repositioning
information contained in a balise group message (see section 3.8.5.3).
3.8.5.2.1
Note: The concerned MA section need not be the end section.
3.8.5.2.2
Upon reception of repositioning information and only if linking information has announced

Inputs for speed and distance monitoring
3.13.2.1
Introduction
3.13.2.1.1
The traction
braking models, the brake position
brake percentage are used for the
definition of the kinematic behaviour of the train after a service brake command oran
emergency brake command has been initiated.
3.13.2.1.2
However; railway brakes have a statistical behaviour and braking distances vary within
the typical distribution for a given condition. Correction factors are therefore incorporated
for the speed and distance monitoring.
3.13.2.1.3
The
correction
factors
will
allow
obtaining,
from
the
nominal
emergency
braking
performance of the train, the
minimum
emergency braking performances that
are
required for reference conditions set by trackside。
3.13.2.2
Train related inputs
3.13.2.2.1
Introduction
3.13.2.2.1.1
The train related inputs to be considered for the speed and distance monitoring are:
a) Traction model
b) Braking models (brake
reaction time;
brake
build up time and speed dependent
deceleration) or brake percentage
Brake position
d) Special brakes (interface configuration and status)
e) Service brake (interface configuration and application)
Traction cut-off interface
9) On-board correction factors
h) Nominal rotating mass
i
Train length

3.13.3
Conversion Models
3.13.3.1
Introduction
3.13.3.1.1
For trains with variable composition (loco hauled trains), the brake characteristics can
vary together with the composition of the train. In this case, it is not convenient to pre-
program the
brake parameters necessary to calculate the braking
CUrVeS.
The only
practical way to obtain the correct values for the current train composition is to include
them into the data
process by the driver. However, it cannot be expected from the
driver to know deceleration values and brake build up times。
Conversion models are
therefore defined to convert the parameters entered by the driver (brake percentage and
brake position) into the parameters of the corresponding brake model.
3.13.3.1.2
Note: The process for defining the input parameters for the conversion model (brake
percentage and brake position) is outside the scope of the ERTMSIETCS specifications.
3.13.3.2
Applicability of the conversion models
3.13.3.2.1
The conversion models shall be used by the on-board equipment if the brake percentage
is acquired as
of Train Data, and xf the maximum train speed, the brake percentage
and the train length are all within the following validity limits of the conversion models:
a) 0 < Vs 200, Where Vis the maximum train speed in kmlh
b)30 <A< 250, Where ^ is the brake percentage in %
C) 0 <L < Lmax, Where Lis the train length in m and Where Lmax
900 mif the brake
position is "Passenger train in P" or Lmax
1500 m x the brake position is "Freight
train in P" or "Freight trainin G'=
3.13.3.2.1.1
Note: The overspeed above the maximum train speed Which may occur due to the
ceiling speed margins is taken into account in the definition of the conversion model。
3.13.3.2.2
For trains not fitting into at least one of those validity limits, it is still possible to acquire
the brake percentage as Train Data, but the conversion models are not applicable; which
means that braking models (i.e. pre-programmed deceleration profiles and brake build
up times) shall be used by the speed and distance monitoring function.

Rotating mass
3.13.4.3.1
The influence of gradients shall be compensated for the rotating mass of the train (see
Figure 35).
3.13.4.3.1.1
Note: Since the rotating mass works like a flywheel (rotating inertia), the effect of the
gradient is reduced. Assume for instance a (theoretical) train without any rotating mass;
not braking, on a downhill gradient from height
to height 2-
All the energy added to the
train when it goes from H1 to H2 is converted into linear forward motion。
This can be
observed as an acceleration due to the gradient. Now assume the same train With part
of the Weight rotating. If this train travels the same distance from H1 to H2,
the same
amount of energy is added to the train.
But now a part of that energy is converted into
rotational motion and only the remaining partis converted into linear forward motion. The
latter can be observed as an acceleration Which is less than for the train without rotating
masS.
3.13.4.3.1.2
Note: For the influence of the rotating mass on the deceleration due to the brake; it is
already taken into account in the values for the brake parameters。

3.13.6.3.2.3
The train related characteristics to be considered are:
a) The values of T_brake_
service_react and T_brake_service acquired as part of Train

Determination of Most Restrictive Speed Profile (MRSP)
3.13.7.1
The Most Restrictive Speed Profile (MRSP) is a description of the most restrictive speed
restrictions the train must obey on a given piece of track。
3.13.7.2
The Most Restrictive Speed Profile shall be derived from elements corresponding to all
speed restrictions (see 3.13.2.2.13 &3.13.2.3.2), some elements being compensated by
the train length 讦 requested by trackside (see 3.11.3.1.3 for SSP,
3.11.4.6 for ASPand

MRSP current speed (V_MRSP);
Which is the lowest speed of the MRSP elements
encountered between the min Safe front end and the max safe front end of the train.

b) xf not inhibited by National Value;
the compensation of the inaccuracy of the speed

The third and fourth assumptions are intended to consider the nominal operation; in
Which the train speed follows the permitted speed, leading to the reduction of the needed

3.13.9.4.2
Note: The release speed may be necessary for two reasons。
One js that a train has to
be able to approach the EOA Where the permitted speed reaches zero and might be too
restrictive to permit acceptable driving due to inaccuracy of the measured distance。
The
other reason is thatin a level
application the train has to be able to overpass the balise
When the signal clears. For these two reasons a (Iow) release speed may be given from
trackside
Or may be calculated on board,
based on the distance from the EOA to the
Supervised Location.
3.13.9.4.3
With each MA, it shall be possible for the trackside to:
a) Give the Value of the release speed directly to the on-board, OR
b) Instruct the on-board to calculate the release speed, OR
Instruct the on-board to use the national value。
3.13.9.4.4

In this case, it is the full responsibility of the infrastructure manager to set the appropriate

3.13.9.4.6

Where the EBI supervision limit

Introduction
3.13.10.1.1 By comparing the train speed and position to the various supervision limits defined in the
previous section, the on-board equipment generates braking commands, traction cut-off
commands and relevant information to the driver. The information displayed to the driver
is selected according to the following supervision statuses of the speed and distance
monitoring function: Normal status, Indication status, Overspeed status, Warning status
and Intervention status.
3.13.10.1.2The following types of speed and distance monitoring are defined:
Ceiling speed monitoring (CSM)
Target speed monitoring (TSM)

Requirements for Target speed monitoring
3.13.10.4.1 In target speed monitoring, both the ceiling supervision limits and the braking to target
supervision limits, described in sections 3.13.9.2 and 3.13.9.3, are used to determine the
commands to the Train Interface and the supervision statuses displayed to the driver。
3.13.10.4.2The on-board equipment shall display to the driver the target information (target speed
and distance to target) related to one target at a time: the Most Relevant Displayed
Target (MRDT):
The MRDT shall be selected amongst the supervised targets Whose
Indication supervision limit is exceeded (i.e。
a condition to trigger a supervision status
with respect to these targets is met, see table 8 and table 9)and shall be determined
according to the following steps:
Step 0: MRDTo = the target of which the braking to target Permitted speed supervision
limit (refer to section 3.13.9.3.5), calculated for the current position of the train, is the
lowest one amongst the concerned targets:

targets, Whose target speed is lower than MRDTo.Atarget is masked by MRDTo i its
Indication supervision limit is located in rear of the location of the MRDT。 Permitted

If at least one target is masked by MRDTo, then the MRDT obtained from this step
(MRDTI) shall be the masked target With its Indication supervision limit the furthest in
rear of the location of the MRDT。 Permitted speed supervision limit and the on-board
equipment shall go to the next step。
If none ofthe remaining targets from the list of concerned targets is masked by MRDT。
or if there is no other remaining target to check in the list of concerned targets, then
the MRDT shall be the target obtained from the previous step (i.e.MRDTO).
Step n: the on-board shall apply step n-1, substituting MRDTnz With MRDTn1 and
checking
the
list of concerned targets excluding
the targets
Which
have
been
preselected as MRDTinall the previous steps (i.e. from MRDTo to MRDTn1 inclusive).
3.13.10.4.2.1
Note
1: the above process for the determination of the MRDT ensures that when
several targets are close to each other i is avoided that a target is displayed after its
Indication supervision limit has been reached。
3.13.10.4.2.2
Note 2: When entering target speed monitoring, there is by definition at least one target
that satisfies the conditions to
be selected

MRDT.
Afterwards (e.9. due to train
braking) it is possible that no target satisfies any more the conditions to be selected as
MRDT, Which however only means that the target previously selected remains the MRDT
(see clause 3.13.10.4.5).
3.13.10.4.2.3
Note 3: f MRDTn1 is a target at Zero speed (e.9. EOA
Or SvL), fhen it is always

3.17.2
Determination of the operated system version
3.17.2.1
The on-board equipment shall be able to operate with (i.e. shall support) any of the
ERTMSIETCS system version numbers X included in its envelope of supported system
versions, as defined in chapter 6.
3.17.2.1.1
Within one of its supported system version numbers X, the on-board equipment shall
always operate the highest system version number Y defined in its envelope of supported
System
Versions, regardless
Of
the system version
number
Y
transmitted
by
the
trackside_
3.17.2.2
The on-board equipment shall operate with only one system version at a time, i.e.it shall
behave according to the whole set of requirements applicable to a system version (refer
to chapter 6 in case the operated system version is older than the last one introduced in
this release of the SRS).
3.17.2.3
The on-board equipment shall determine the operated system version number X,in
relation to non-RBC trackside constituents, as the highest system version number X
transmitted in the telegrams forming a balise group message (i.e. the telegrams which
are not ignored as per a clause referred to in the column "Telegram" of the Table 17), or
as the
System version number Xtransmitted by a loop Whose message is not ignored as
per a clause referred to in the column "Message'
of the Table 17,
Or as the
System
version number X transmitted by an RIU, x this system version number X is higher than
the currently operated one.
3.17.2.4
It shall be possible from balise group to order the on-board equipment to operate a
System version。
3.17.2.5
Once a balise group message has been received, 讦 one of the telegrams forming the
message (i.e.a telegram Which is not ignored as per a clause referred to in the column
"Telegram" of the Table 17) includes an order to operate system version Which Would
not be ignored as per a clause referred to in the column
Individual information" of the
Table 17, the on-board equipment shall immediately operate the system version number
given in the order, regardless of the clauses 3.17.2.3 and 3.17.2.6. After the order is
executed, the clauses 3.17.2.3 and 3.17.2.6 shall again apply for any further received
balise grouplloop message orany further contacted RIU.
3.17.2.5.1
Note: the system version order is to be used wherever it is necessary to enforce an
operated system version number X lower than the currently operated one。
3.17.2.6
If a mismatch has been detected between the country or region identifier read from a
balise grouplloop and the corresponding identifier(s) of the applicable set of national
Values; the on-board equipment shall consider the highest system version number X
transmitted in the telegrams forming the balise group message (i.e. telegrams Which are
not ignored as per a clause referred to in the column "Telegram'
of the Table 17) orthe
system version number X transmitted by the loop Whose message is not ignored as per
3 clause referred to in the column "Message" of the Table 17,as the operated one and
Shall comply again with requirement 3.17.2.3. For balise groups, the on-board equipment

3.17.2.7
If the on-board equipment does not support the system version number X transmitted by
3
non-RBC trackside constituent or the one specified in the balise group order, it shall
consider the operated system version as unchanged.
3.17.2.8
In case of communication session established with an RBC, the system version number
Xof the RBC shall take precedence on the operated system version in relation to non-
RBC constituents and on System version ordered from balise group; the operated system
version number X shall be determined according to the following principles:
a) xf the on-board equipment is in level 0,
NTC Or
(e.9. entrance in level 2 area), the
RBC System version number X shall be operated when the transition to level 2 is
executed;
b) xf the on-board equipment is in level
2 (SOM procedure
Or order received from
trackside), the RBC system version number X shall be operated immediately;
c) in case of session established with an accepting RBC (RBC/RBC Handover); the
accepting RBC system version number X shall be operated as soon as the train has
passed the RBCIRBC border location with its maximum safe front end;
d) in case the on-board equipment switches from level 2 to another level (e.9. exit from
a level 2 area); the system version control in relation to non-RBC constituents shall
be again applied and the balise group orders shall be again considered;
in case the engine passes the RBCIRBC border location with its maximum safe front
end and no session is established with the accepting RBC, the system version control
in relation to non-RBC constituents shall be again applied and the balise group orders
shall be again considered.
3.17.2.8.1
Foritem a): i the switch from level 0, NTC or
to level 2 results from an immediate level
transition order or a conditional level transition order received from balise group and i
the
RBC system version number X is different from the system version
number
X
operated before the level transition, the checks ofthe raw balise group message and the
evaluation of its Whole content shall be performed taking into account the RBC system
Version
and
shall substitute
the checks
and
evaluation performed beforehand
with
regards to the previously operated system version。
3.17.2.8.2
For item d): 讦 the switch from level 2 to another level results from an immediate level
transition order or a conditional level transition order received from balise group, the
clauses
3.17.2.3,
3.17.2.5
and
3.17.2.6 shall be immediately checked to determine
Whether a change of operated system version occurs. If s0, the checks of the raw balise
group message and the evaluation of its whole content shall be performed taking into
account the new operated system version and shall substitute the checks and evaluation
performed beforehand with regards to the previously operated system version。

later Vversions of the ERTMSIETCS if required. These parameters are not defined as
National data.
3.18.2
National
Default Values
3.18.2.1
Note: Appendix to chapter 3 contains list of National and Default Values。
3.18.2.2
Trains shall be supervised according to the National Values of the current infrastructure
讦
they are available on-board.
3.18.2.3
National Values are transmitted with the area(s) (country or region)in Which they are
applicable. They shall become applicable at a defined location, or shall be applicable
immediately。
3.18.2.4
Evaluating a balise group message, the balise identity information referring to the country
or region shall be used to ensure that correct National Values are used.
3.18.2.5
For each National Value, the corresponding Default Value shall be used as fall back

The National Values currently applicable When the on-board equipment is switched Off
(i.e. enters No Power mode) shall be retained and shall remain
applicable when powered

3.18.2.7.1
Justification:
The
aim
of this requirement is
to limit the
number of balise groups
containing National Value information. Once a set of National Values has been received
on-board, there is no need to re-load the information unless National Values change, the
on-board equipment loses the information (failure situation), or the train enters an area
requiring different National Values。
3.18.2.8
The applicable set of National Values data shall be transmitted from the trackside on
transition between areas requiring a different set of National Values。

When anew setof National Values becomes applicable its content shall always overwrite
the corresponding
National
Values currently applicable regardless of the country
Or
region identifier(s).
3.18.2.9

讦
a new set of National Values is received, or
the ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment is switched Off (i.e., enters No Power mode)
3.18.2.10
If a National Value becomes invalid, i.e。
a mismatch has been detected between the
country or region identifier read from a balise group and the corresponding identifier(s)
of the applicable set with Which the National Value Was received and stored, then it shall
be deleted.
3.18.2.11
When
a

becomes applicable, any ongoing supervision
involving an overwritten National Value of type time or distance shall continue, but using
the corresponding value from the new set. However, the starting location or starting time
Shall remain unchanged.

In case the reverse movement or the relocation brings back the max safe antenna
position in rear of the start location of the big metal mass area, the on-board Will stop
ignoring the alarms Which
be triggered by big metal masses (i.e. the clauses
3.12.1.2.1.2and 3.12.1.3 apply)
In case the reverse movement or the relocation brings back the min safe front end in
rearofan unprotected LX end location, the on-board will take again into account the
LX speed restriction (i.e.3.13.10.2.8 applies) and display again the unprotected LX
status (i.e. 5.16.1.5 applies)
The transition to TR mode on passing the EOAILOA Will never be reverted, even i
the train moves backwards in rear of the EOAILOA location. Reason: on purpose; no
such transition back to FSIOSILS is specified in sections 4.6.2 and 4.6.3.
The transition from CSM to TSM on passing the Indication supervision limit Will not
be reverted in case of relocation that brings back the train front end in rear of the
Indication supervision limit. Reason: it has been specified in that Way for obvious
ergonomic reasons (see 3.13.10.6.1.
A.3.5.2
maximum time Tn (see Subset-036 clause 4.2.9) after it has received a balise group
message (i.e.
3
maximum time Tn after i has received the last balise telegram of the
balise group), the ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment shall not consider any action
related to passing an EOA (only in level 1, an LOA,
or a former EOAILOA located in
advance of the train position measured at the time of reception of this last telegram, until
the content of the message has been taken into account.
A.3.5.2.1
Example 1: in level 1, the crossing of the EOAILOA location with the min safe antenna;
before a
new extended MA (received when the min safe antenna
Was in rear of the
EOALOA)has been processed, will not lead to train trip. In other terms the replacement
of the EOALOA is considered
by the
on-board
as happening
before the
min Safe
antenna crosses the EOAILOA location (i.e. preventing that clause 3.13.10.2.7 applies).
A.3.5.2.2
Example 2: when the override function is active, the crossing of the former EOALOA
location by the min safe antenna, before a "Stop if in SR" information (received when the
min safe antenna was in rear of the former EOALOA) has been processed, Will not lead
to the end of the override procedure followed by a train trip due to "Stop if in SR". In other
terms, both the deletion of the former EOAILOA and the end of override procedure (see
5.8.3.1.3 and 5.8.4.1c)) are considered by the on-board as simultaneously happening
before the min Safe antenna crosses the former EOAILOA location。
A.3.5.2.3
Example 3: in level 2, the crossing of the LOA location with the min safe front end before
an immediate level transition order to level NTC or level 0 (received when the min safe
front end was in rear of the LOA) has been processed, Will not lead to train trip. In other
terms the deletion of the MA (and therefore the deletion of the LOA) due to the level
change is considered by the on-board
35
happening before the
min safe front end
crosses the LOA location (i.e. preventing that clause 3.13.10.2.6a) applies).

Deletion of accepted and stored information when used
A.3.6.1
Standard case
A.3.6.1.1
When the train moves in the direction of its train orientation, storage capacity occupied
by trackside information no longer used, i.e.
the related on-board functionality has been
completed, shall be made available immediately.
A.3.6.1.1.1 Note:
The requirement is needed to allow trackside to predict the storage capacity
available on-board in order to comply with dimensioning rules regards information stored
on-board given in Subset 040.
A.3.6.2
Exception
A.3.6.2.1
Following information shall remain stored on-board for a distance defined by a fixed value
in rear of the min safe rear end position of the train:
location dependent static speed restrictions
ie。
SSP,ASP,
TSR, LX SR, PBD SR
(see 3.11.2.2),
gradient information,
reduced adhesion information received from trackside;
Track condition "Big metal masses'
MA Section entry points and their associated Section timer stop locations.
A.3.6.2.1.1 Note: The above information remains stored for the case of a reverse movement:
With the exception of the track condition "Big metal masses"
the stored information
allows the ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment to calculate speed supervision limits
after a reverse movement (roll-away, or initiated by the driver);
Track condition
'Big metal masses'
is needed also for a reverse movement itself to
avoid any false alarms due to Big metal masses in the track,
The MA Section information is needed to apply the clause 3.8.4.2.4in case of reverse
movement in rear of an MA Section timer stop location.
A.3.6.2.1.2 Note: The distance to intervention of the
Roll Away Protection
Or the Unauthorised
Direction Movement Protection is determined by a NationallDefault value。
This is also
true for a reverse movement in Post trip mode. However, following an intervention, the
train Will not stop immediately. In order to keep the on-board functionality simple;
a fixed
distance Value Was chosen to define an unambiguous location in rear of the train where
the above information is no longer required and the related on-board storage capacity is
made available again。

It might though result in emergency brake intervention if the driver

A.3.12
Calculation of reduced values of safe brake build up time and
expected brake build up time
A.3.12.1
Introduction
A.3.12.1.1 Modelling the brake build up effort using a ramp function rather than a step function
allows to predict that a certain deceleration development may be enough to safely reach
3
target with only a portion of the equivalent brake build up time elapsed.
A.3.12.1.2 This section defines how the safe brake build up time and expected brake build up times
can be reduced to take profit of such effect。
A.3.12.1.3 This computation is done for each target according to the following seven steps:
a) Determination of the inputs for the computation;
b) Extrapolation of the train speed development over the brake reaction time, to check
whether this extrapolated speed is above the target speed at this time;
Extrapolation of the train speed development over the full brake build up time along
the ramp model;
d) Computation of the time at which the target speed is reached along the ramp model,
for the targets whose speed is higher than this train speed extrapolated as per bullet
C);
e
Computation of the corresponding travelled distances;
Conversion of these travelled distances into reduced values of safe and expected
(equivalent) brake build up times that are to be used in the formulas to derive the
EBIISBI supervision limits;
9) Selection of the highest reduced values of safe and expected (equivalent) brake build
up times amongst the
ones ensuring equivalent speed reduction
and the
ones
ensuring equivalent travelled distance。

A.3.12.9.1
The purpose of this part is to explain how the formulas given in the rest of section A.3.12
have been obtained. The explanation is based on the emergency brake related formulas,
A.3.12.7.17 explains how these can be modified to obtain service brake related formulas。

About
A.3.12.3&4:
For these calculations;
计
is
assumed (refer to figure

and
3.13.9.3.2) that once the emergency
brake command is triggered,
the
train speed
(compensated for the speed measurement inaccuracy Vaeltao)
increases
with
acceleration
UP
to
TQX
tme
and
then
with

acceleration.
This speed
increase is compensated by the AEB deceleration coming from the brake force as per the
ramp model from Tbe_react to tzbe (refer to Figure 31. The average deceleration coming
from the brake force is half of its final (full) Value。

A.3.12.9.7
The value of Dtzbe_
is the Value Of d_ramp(tzbe_enough)。
It must be noticed that after
eT0U9h
having travelled this distance, the wanted final speed is reached,i.e. no distance is to be
travelled over the EBD curve.
A.3.12.9.8
About A.3.12.7: Because the model that is used in section 3.13 is a step model;
We
need to find Which (artificial) value Of Tbe
enough_step_dist

lead to obtaining the same travelled distance Dtzbe
In contrast to the Use of the
e120U9h
ramp model, a section of the EBD curve is needed here; between this sought time tbe_en
and the time the wanted final speed Vtarget , here called VT ) is reached。

A.3.12.9.16Since tbe_X
is always
0
the Valid solution of the
一Aestz
quadratic equation is derived from the positive sign in front of the square root.
A.3.12.9.17 About A.3.12.8: This Value tbe_en'
ie.
tbe_enough_step_dist,
ensures that the distance
travelled along the step model (supporting section 3.13 formulas) is equivalent to the one
computed along the ramp model. However, i does not ensure that the speed reduction
js
equivalent along both models。
A.3.12.9.18Therefore;
an
equivalent
brake
build

time
tbe_enough_step_deltaV
computed from
tzbe_eough is used as a lower limit to the final Tbe_reducea Value. Its
computation is similar

be caused by active
reduction of brake build up times (see Appendix A.3.12).
A.3.13.2
The boolean stating whether the displayed permitted speed and SBI speed are

algorithm:
If on-board is in target speed monitoring or release speed monitoring then
If the MRDT changes then

Else f T
be_reduced computed for any target is lower than T

end of the SR distance (see section 3.6.7) shall be based on a supervision starting
When SR mode is entered, or, already in Staff Responsible mode;
when Override is
activated.
b) Ifthe max permitted distance to runin SR mode is determined by the value transmitted
by the RBC,
or entered by the driver, the calculation of the remaining distance from
the virtual train position to the end of the SR distance (see section 3.6.7) shall be
based on a
supervision starting when the distance information is received or entered。
Ifthe max permitted distance to run in SR mode is determined by the value transmitted
by Euroloop, the distance information transmitted by Euroloop shall be referred to one
or more reference balise groups. On-board shall evaluate the distance to run in SR

Some transitions have received the same priority order. This has been decided when i
is obvious that these transitions cannot occur at the same time, and So can never lead
toa
conflicting situation (for example, the RBC cannot give in the same time a MA for FS
and a MA for OS to a given engine; this is Why the transition "from SR to FS" and the

DMI depending on modes
4.7.1
Introduction
4.7.1.1
The DMIis an interface that allows the direct exchange of information between the driver
and the ERTMSIETCS onboard equipment. The indirect exchange of information done
Via the train interface (e.9.a drivers action on the service brake used for the service
brake feedback, openinglclosing the desk) is not part of the DMl.
4.7.1.2
The device(s) used to select
ERTMSIETCS onboard equipment poweredlunpowered"
is (are) not part of the DMI.
4.7.1.3
The device(s) used to selectlindicate
ERTMSIETCS onboard equipment isolatedlnot

Of the DMl.
4.7.1.4
Intentionally deleted。
4.7.1.5

4.7.2.1.1
X = active: For a DMI output, this means that the output information shall be shown to
the driver When the ERTMSIETCS onboard equipment is in the mode indicated in the
column.
For a DMI input; this means that it shall be possible for the driver to enter this
information when the ERTMSIETCS onboard equipment is in the mode indicated in the
column).

Acceptance of received information
4.8.1
Introduction
4.8.1.1
Theaim ofthis chapter is to give an overview of which information is accepted or rejected
depending
on
the
state
of the
on-board (level,
mode);
the origin
Of the
received
information (from RBC or not), and in case of information not transmitted by an RBC the
type of information
or non-infill).
4.8.1.2
The following sections have to be interpreted by applying the filters as shown in Figure
3_
The first filter is detailed in section 4.8.3 " Accepted information depending on the level,
the origin
and
the type
of information'
the
third
filter in
Section
4.8.4
Accepted
information depending on the mode and the type of information"
4.8.1.3
Ifa message contains level transition information, any other information in that message
shall be evaluated considering the level transition information。
4.8.1.3.1
Information received in the same message as an immediate level transition order or a
conditional level transition order that causes a level transition shall be evaluated against
the first filter in two steps:
1) A first evaluation shall take place considering the on-board currently operated level,
as xa level transition order for further location had been received (i.e.the condition
[1] or [2] of Figure 3, x applied, shall be automatically fulfilled).
2) Then, xf relevant, information to which the condition [1] or [2] of Figure 3 applies shall
be immediately extracted from the buffer and re-evaluated according to the new
selected level。
The information accepted or rejected immediately considering the on-
board currently operated level shall not be re-evaluated according to the new selected
level:
4.8.1.4
Note: As shown in Figure 3, information stored following an announcement of a change
Of level, is re-checked for acceptance when the level has changed. This implies that;
When the level changes, the mode is
for a short moment
still unchanged, until the
stored information has been processed。
The consequence for the Third Filter is that
information needs to be accepted for this short period also in
modes in Which this
information is otherwise Useless.
4.8.1.5
Ifa message contains infill information , this latter shall be evaluated considering all other
non-infill information in that message。
4.8.1.6
When evaluating trackside information received by radio or when re-evaluating a set of
information released from
the transition
buffer, linking information,
x any, shall
be
evaluated prior to any other location related information.

a) the information complies with the system version checks (see section 3.17.3) and with
the data consistency checks (see section 3.16)
b) With the exception of information part of an SM authorisation, the direction for Which
the information is Valid
matches the current train orientation;
Or the balise group
crossing direction (for SL, PS and SH engines) (see section 3.6.3)
In level 2,
i is assumed that the "RBC" information Which is marked "A
(Accepted)
comes from the supervising RBC (see RBCIRBC handover)。
I this information is
received from the
Accepting" RBC while the "Handing Over RBC is still responsible;
it is stored onboard until the RBC transition is performed
Exception
1:
The

accepted。
Exception
2:
The information

"Request to

and

rejected。
to check exception [4] in 4.8.3, the track description is referred to the SOLR (i.e。
relocation has been performed see 3.6.4.3).
the information from balise is received while no movement opposite to the authorised
direction is performed (see clause 3.14.3.6)
4.8.2.2
Regarding 4.8.2.1a): In case a balise is missed or a balise telegram cannot be decoded,
the information "Inhibition of balise group message consistency reaction" is only used by
the on-board equipment to inhibit the service
brake reaction,
While the balise group
message is rejected。 If all the telegrams from a
balise group
are correctly read, the
information
'Inhibition of balise group message consistency reaction",
讦 received, shall
beignored by the on-board equipment. Therefore this information need not to be referred
to in the following tables。
4.8.2.3
In case a balise telegram contains the information VBC marker and a countrylregion
identity that both match a stored VBC, the Whole balise telegram is ignored and any
further
Check in relation to this
balise telegram
is irrelevant (refer to 3.15.93 b)):
Otherwise the information VBC marker, x included in a consistent balise group message;
shall always be ignored by the ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment and need not to be
referred to in the following tables。
4.8.2.4
Note: with the exception of the data that is forwarded to a National System through the
STM interface (see 3.15.6 and SUBSET-035), What will happen to the data to be used
by applications outside ERTMSIETCS (e.9. whether it is discarded, forwarded to
an
external application, processed by a national function.. ) is outside the scope of this
specification
and
is assumed
35
not being
part
Of
te
ERTMSIETCS
on-board
functionality.
4.8.2.5
Note: the system version order received from balise group need not be referred to in the
following tables because it is taken into account by the on-board equipment prior to the
checks referred to in this section (see also clause 3.17.3.3).

Handling of transition buffer in case of level transition announcement or
RBCIRBC handover
4.8.5.1
Ifan order to switch to level NTC,
Or 2 at a further location has been received, the
ERTMSIETCS onboard equipment shall be able to store in a transition buffer (see figure
3, first filter) three sets of information obtained from three filtered messages.
4.8.5.2
If an RBC transition order has been received and the Handing Over RBC is still the
supervising
one; the ERTMSIETCS onboard equipment shall
be able to store in
3
transition buffer (see figure 3, second filter) three sets of information obtained from three
filtered messages from the Accepting RBC.
4.8.5.2.1
Note: the term "set of information'
refers to the
of a message being stored in the
transition buffer (i.e。
information which is neither accepted nor rejected immediately)
according to the conditions stated in 4.8.3.1 [1] and [2] (for level transition) or according
to 4.8.2.1c (for RBCIRBC handover).
4.8.5.3
In case three sets of information are already stored in the transition buffer, any new set
to be stored shall replace the oldest one currently stored.
4.8.5.4
The sets of information stored in the transition buffer shall be deleted:
a) in case the level transition order is deleted or overwritten by another level transition
order for a different level, OR
b) in case the RBC transition order is deleted or overwritten by an order to switch to
another Accepting RBC,OR
in case the communication session with the RBC that provided the stored information
is terminated
4.8.5.5
At the same time the level transition is performed or at the same time the Accepting RBC
becomes the supervising one, the sets of information stored in the transition buffer shall
be released and re-evaluated in the sequence they have been received。
4.8.5.6
This sequential re-evaluation ofall the released information shall be a prerequisite to any
use by the on-board equipment (e.9. i will lead neither to an intermediate change of
mode nor to a change of information displayed to the driver) and shall obey the following
principles:
3) Starting from the information currently used by on-board at the moment the levellRBC
transition is effective; the ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment shall determine the new
information
for
train
supervision;
by
performing
sequential
updates
from
the
information released from the transition buffer, xf accepted.
b) For each information update related to a re-evaluated set of information,
the same
rules shall apply as to information update related to new information accepted outside
a IevellRBC transition context。
The information resulting from this sequential update shall then
be used by the
ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment

4.8.5.7
Accepting re-evaluated Conditional Emergency Stop information according to table 4.8.3
implies that the accepted Conditional Emergency Stop information may be accepted or
rejectedin a further step (see clause 3.10.2.2) depending on the given stop location. This
decision, based on the comparison between the min safe front end position of the train
at the time the message Was received and the given stop location, shall be considered
of the evaluation process as it affects the further re-evaluation of information stored
in the transition buffer (see clause 3.10.2.4).
4.8.5.7.1
Note: For the case of the Unconditional Emergency Stop information accepting the
information according to table 4.8.3 will always lead to the train being tripped (see clause
3.10.2.3) when re-evaluation of the transition buffer is completed. Information accepted
during re-evaluation of information stored in the transition buffer can then be affected on
transition to TR mode according to conditions in Table 4.10.
4.8.5.8
Note: The requirement to acknowledge an Emergency Stop information according to
clause 3.10.1.4,i.e.
communicating to the RBC if the information has been accepted
(Conditional or Unconditional Emergency Stop) or rejected because the train has passed
the stop location (Conditional Emergency Stop only), applies to the time When the
information is
used, immediately
after the sequential update
has
been completed。
Regards acknowledging the reception of an emergency stop message, as for any other
information received from trackside, see clause 3.16.3.5.

the entered mode
the brake command reason is to be re-evaluated according to the data available in
the entered mode
not relevant (there is no transition from the mode in Which the brake command reason
could be applicable to the entered mode or the transition condition(s) to the entered
mode can only be fulfilled
When the condition(s) to release the

Introduction
5.3.1
Scope and Purpose
5.3.1.1
This document defines the procedures that are necessary for interoperability within the
scope Of ERTMSIETCS.
5.3.1.2
Each procedure is defined by a set of mandatory requirements and, where convenient;
is illustrated by a flowchart。
5.3.1.3
In case the condition(s) in chapter
4
triggering a
mode transition is(are) fulfilled, this
transition shall be executed even i not shown in the chapter 5 procedures。
5.3.1.3.1
Note: Such a mode transition could lead to exiting a procedure immediately (e.9. cut off
power of on-board equipment, isolation of on-board equipment).
5.3.1.4
National operation rules (outside of ERTMSIETCS)
are also excluded,
but may
be
applied by the railways in addition to the procedures
as long
as interoperability is
retained
5.3.2
Definitions
5.3.2.1
Procedures
4
procedure defines the required reaction ofthe ERTMSIETCS entities (subsystems and
components ) to either information exchanged between ERTMSIETCS entities or events
(triggered by external entities or internal events).
The procedures focus on the required
change in status and mode of the described ERTMSIETCS entities。
5.3.2.2
Entities
The procedures define the required system behaviour on a context level, i. e. the entities
that are used to define the procedures are for example: the on-board equipment, the
trackside equipment (RBC/Balise), the driver。
5.3.2.3
States
States are situations of an ETCS subsystem with a specific set of available functions and
a
specific set of events that may start or terminate the state.
A state remains active as
long as the conditions to trigger the transition to a succeeding state are not completely
Satisfied.
Note 1: one mode of operation may include several states for the on-board equipment.
Note 2: A new state is only created, x the behaviour of the system differs from another
one
Possession
of information
(e.
9
location information)
Or
not
does
not force
branching in states。
5.3.2.4
Transitions
Transitions define the rules for passing from one state to another.A transition is triggered
by a set of conditions Which has to be fulfilled in a defined order or at the same time。

Procedure Start of mission
5.4.1
Introduction
5.4.1.1
The driver may have to start a mission:
a) Once the train is awake, OR
b) Once shunting movements are finished, OR
C) Once a mission is ended, OR
d) Once a desk is opened (e.9. When a slave engine becomes a leading engine).
5.4.1.2
The common point of all these situations is that the ERTMSIETCS on-board is in Stand-
By mode; but the Start of Mission will be different, since some data may be already stored
on-board, depending on the previous situation。
5.4.1.3
Once the ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment is in Stand-By mode; the start of mission
is not the only possibility, the engine may become remote controlled (i.e. the on-board
switches to Sleeping mode):
5.4.1.4
If, upon desk opening, there is an already established communication session for which
no termination is ongoing, the ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment shall first terminate
this communication session。
5.4.2
Status of data stored in the ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment
5.4.2.1
At the beginning of the Start of Mission procedure; the data required may be in one of
three states:
a) "Valid" (the stored value is known to be correct)
b) "Invalid" (the stored value may be wrong)
C) "Unknown" (no stored value available)
5.4.2.2
This refers to the following data: Driver ID, ERTMSIETCS level, RBC contact information,
Train Data, Train Running Number, Train Position (see 3.6.1.3).
5.4.2.3
Note 1: The status of data in relation to the previous and the actual mode is described in
chapter 4
section
What happens to stored information When entering a mode".
5.4.2.4
Note 2: The change of status of data in course Of the procedure is shown in the table in
Section 5.4.3.3.

This procedure is used to allow the entry of a train into a shunting area。
5.7.1.2
Note: The shunting area, possibly including a "safety envelope" , can be already occupied
by shunting units, not controlled by the trackside
It is therefore possible that the train
Shall enter into the shunting area in OS mode. The switch to OS is performed according
to the relevant procedure.
5.7.1.3
The order to switch to SH mode shall be given by means of a mode profile, optionally
With a list of balise groups, Which the train can pass When the ERTMSIETCS on-board
equipment is in shunting mode。
5.7.1.4
The switch to shunting, if the transition to shunting was ordered by trackside; requires a
driver acknowledgement, according to the specifications below.

Procedure Override
5.8.1
Introduction
5.8.1.1
In
specific degraded situations (for example in the case of a failed signal, failed track
circuit, failed point.. . ), railways allow a train to pass its End of Movement Authority。
5.8.1.2
For ERTMSIETCS, passing an End of Movement Authority can be required in degraded
situations, e.9.
In level 2,
讦 a train is stopped without MA in a location Where radio is unavailable
(e.9. after having received an emergency message, or after a train trip).
In level 2,
x a train is stopped at the border between two adjacent RBCs (e.9. the
interface between RBCsis unavailable).
In level 2, 讦 a train is stopped after having passed the border between two adjacent
RBCs (e.9. the connection to the Accepting RBC cannot be established)
In level 2,
讦 the RBC is unable to give a permission to run (e.9. lost connection with
the interlocking)
In level 1, ia signal cannot show a proceed aspect (e.9., signal failure; route cannot
be set)
In level 1, xa train is stopped without MA (e.9. after the MA has been shortened due
to a time-out)
5.8.1.3
In level OINTC areas, passing a signal at danger is only a national procedure:
The
ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment is not involved in this procedure; since it does not
supervise the train movements.
5.8.1.4
In
ERTMS equipped
areas (level
1
Or 2), locations
Where the train shall stop are
supervised by the ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment. Receiving an order from the
signalman to pass the End of Movement Authority, the driver must then be able to inhibit
this supervision。
5.8.1.4.1
Note: The driver must not use the "Override" procedure unless authorised by trackside
personnel. This authorisation is covered by operational procedures。
5.8.1.5
Ifa signal at danger must be passed between announcement and execution of the level
transition from an unfitted area (level 0) or from an area fitted with a National System
(level NTC) to an ERTMS equipped area (level 1
Or2 ), the
signalman gives the order to
the driver to select "override'
5.8.1.6
Note: By using this procedure the driveris fully responsible for the train driving. Therefore
Staff Responsible mode is entered when the driver selects "override".
5.8.1.7
In addition the procedure allows to avoid a train trip When passing a balise group:
3)
transmitting "stop if in SR mode"
b) not contained in the list of expected balises in SR mode

5.8.1.8
Further, the Override procedure allows a train in SR mode reaching the end of the SR
distance to proceed (see also 4.4.11.1.6.5)
5.8.1.9
In case the Override procedure is selected while the ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment
considers a
temporary EOA (as per clause 3.12.2.4,3.12.4.7or 3.12.5.8) Which is closer
than the EOA,all the instances of the term EOA throughout this section 5.8 shall relate
to this temporary EOA。
5.8.2
Selection of "Override"
5.8.2.1
The ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment shall allow the driver to select "Override" only
when:
a) Thetrain speed is under or equal to the speed limit fortriggering the "override" function
(national value) AND
b) The current mode is Full Supervision, Automatic Driving, Limited Supervision, On
Sight, Staff Responsible; Shunting, Unfitted, Post Trip, Stand By (in level 2 only) or
SN (National System) AND
Validated Train Data and Train running number are available (except When alreadyin
Shunting mode)
5.8.2.2
Intentionally deleted。
5.8.2.3
The "Override" procedure shall be triggered when selected by the driver.
5.8.3
Once the 'Override" procedure has been triggered
5.8.3.1
The mode shall change as follows:
a) If the current mode is Full Supervision, Automatic Driving, Limited Supervision, On
Sight, Stand-By
Or
Post Trip; the
mode
shall immediately
Switch
to
the
Staff
Responsible (SR) mode (讦 the mode is already SRit remains unchanged)
b) If the current mode is Shunting the mode shall remain unchanged
If the current mode is Unfitted (level 0 area) or SN (level NTC area) the mode shall
only change to Staff Responsible When the level changes to
1
Or 2 (refer to SRS
chapter 4, transitions between modes)
5.8.3.1.1
If the mode; When activating Override, is OS, LS, FS or AD, the former EOALOA shall
be retained. If the mode is SB or PT and there is a Valid train position stored on-board,
the current position of the train front shall be considered as the former EOALOA. If the
modeis SBor PTand there is no valid train position stored on-board, the on-board shall

former EOAILOA.
5.8.3.1.2
Note: This former EOALOA will be used as a Trip condition if the Override function is no
longer active.
further activation of the Override in SR mode has no effect on the
former EOAILOA.
5.8.3.1.3
The former EOAILOA shall be deleted 讦:
a) the train reads the information "stop if in SR mode" from a balise group OR
b) SR mode is left。
5.8.3.2
Note 1: In level 2,
讦 radio communication is available, the RBC is only informed that the
Override has been triggered by means of the reported mode change (if there is any)
5.8.3.3
Note 2: In level 2, x the ERTMSIETCS- onboard equipment is able to report the mode
change to the RBC, the RBC may transmit limits for the distance to run in SR mode
(overriding the national value), a list of balise groups to be passed in SR mode (refer to
chapter 4
Staff Responsible mode)
5.8.3.4
Note 3: In level 2, the transition to SR mode triggered by selecting Override revokes all
emergency stop orders previously received.
5.8.3.5
In SR mode the driver may modify the value of the SR
mode speed limit and of the
distance to run in SR mode (refer to chapter 4, Staff Responsible mode)
5.8.3.6
The train trip shall be inhibited (suppression of the transition to the Trip mode), and only
in level 0

Procedure On Sight
5.9.1
General Requirements
5.9.1.1
The ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment shall be in
On Sight mode before the train
reaches the beginning of the On Sight area or, at the latest, when the train reaches the
beginning of the On Sight area。
5.9.1.2
An acknowledgement for running in On Sight mode is requested from the driver. The
conditions of the acknowledgement are specified below.
5.9.2
On Sight is requested for current location (from modes different from
Stand By and Post Trip)
5.9.2.1
In a level
area, the beginning of the On Sight area can be the balise (group) that gives
the Mode Profile. When the train passes the balise group and receives this information,
the ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment shall immediately switch to On Sight mode.
5.9.2.2
In a level 2 area, the ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment can receive
a mode profile
giving an On Sight area which the train position confidence interval already overlaps. If
starting from the min safe front end of the train this On Sight area is the furthest area that
the train position confidence interval overlaps within the mode profile, the ERTMSIETCS
on-board equipment shall immediately switch to On Sight mode。
5.9.2.3
The driver must
acknowledge the On Sight mode。
A
request of acknowledgement shall
be displayed to the driver。
5.9.2.4
If the driver has not acknowledged within the driver acknowledgement time (refer to
Appendix A.3.1) after the change to OS mode; the service brake command shall be
triggered。
5.9.2.5
Note: Once in On Sight mode; the speed supervision is such that the train speed cannot
exceed the OS mode speed limit. If, When entering the On Sight mode, the train speed
Was higher than the OS mode speed limit (because a higher speed Was allowed in Full
Supervision mode, in Automatic Driving mode, in Limited Supervision mode orin Staff
Responsible mode) then a servicelemergency brake command could be immediately
triggered, independently of the acknowledgement of the driver, but because of the On
Sight supervision (see Figure 4).

When the driver acknowledges; the ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment shall perform
the transition to On Sight mode.

Exit of On Sight mode
5.9.6.1
General rule
5.9.6.1.1
The ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment shall exit the On Sight mode When the min safe
front end of the train passes the end of the On Sight area。
5.9.6.2
First case: The On Sight area ends at the EOAILOA of the current MA
5.9.6.2.1
This occurs When the end of the On Sight area that is given by the Mode Profile has the
same location as the EOAILOA of the related MA.
5.9.6.2.2
In this case, the train must receive a new Movement Authority to be able to exit the On
Sightarea。
5.9.6.2.3
Note: In an On Sight area there is no guarantee for the RBC that the track in front of the
supervised train is free。
Therefore,
i the
next block section
is free;
the
RBC
has
nevertheless to ensure that there is no trainlvehicle between the train and the end of the
On Sight area. This information
can be given to the RBC by the signalman or any other trackside means (outside
scope of ERTMSIETCS), Or
can be inquired by the RBC by means of the following mechanism: the RBC sends a
"track ahead free" request Which the ERTMS/ ETCS on-board equipment displays to
the driver。 If the driver confirms that the track is free up to the end of the current
section, the ERTMS/ ETCS on-board equipment will transmit this information to the
RBC.
5.9.6.2.4
Note: Receiving the "track ahead free" information, the RBC may be able to transmit an
MA from the current position of the train, e.9., for Full Supervision (refer to SRS chapter
4, transitions between modes).
5.9.6.3
Second case: The On Sight area ends before the EOAILOA of the current MA
5.9.6.3.1
In this case, the current Movement Authority already allows the train to exit the On Sight
area_
5.9.6.3.2
When exiting the On Sight area, the ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment switches either
to Full Supervision, to Limited Supervision or to Shunting mode (refer to SRS chapter 4,
transitions between modes).

Every level transition border to an area where operation in level 2 or NTC is supported
shall be announced to the ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment via balise group or via the
RBC.
5.10.1.2
level transition announcement to the ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment shall consist
of an order to execute the level transition at a further location corresponding to the
border。
5.10.1.3
When the ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment receives a level transition announcement;
and ifthis announcement will resultin a change of the on-board level, i shall immediately
inform the driver about the announced level transition。
5.10.1.3.1
Note: In
a
mixed level area the actual level of the on-board equipment may remain
unchanged even though a level transition boundary is passed.
5.10.1.4
At the level transition border a balise group shall be placed with
an immediate level
transition order or a conditional level transition order。
5.10.1.4.1
Note: Balise groups are read in all levels and level transition orders and conditional level
transition orders from balises are accepted independent of the level of operation. Also

Note regarding a) and b: how the ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment checks the
availability of the FRMCS on-board equipment; of the GSM-R Mobile Terminals or of the
National System (in case no STM is used) is an implementation issue。
5.10.2.4.2
Examples: The table of trackside supported levels gives 2,
NTC X, 1,
NTC Y.
If level 1
0and NTC Xare " Available for Use'
the ERTMSIETCS on-board will select NTC Xlevel。
If level 1, 0and NTC Yare
'Available for Use'
i will select level 1. If level 2,
1and 0are
'Available for use'
i Will select level 2
5.10.2.5
When the onboard has selected the level i Will switch to, i shall carry out the level
transition as xf t has received a level transition order to this level only i.e. i shall ignore
the requirements related to transitions to the other levels.
5.10.2.6
The ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment shall inform the driver about the selected level

Change of Train Orientation
5.12.1
Introduction
5.12.1.1
The scope of this procedure is the supervision Of a train Where the driver controls the
train from the cab in the front of the train With the direction controller in FORWARD
position.
5.12.1.2
This implies that When the driver has to change the orientation of the train, he has to
change the driving cab.
5.12.1.3
The scope of this procedure is
NOT shunting movements; during which the
driver
changes the running direction of the train
without leaving the cab,
by changing the
position of the direction controller from FORWARD to REVERSE。
5.12.1.4
The scope of this procedure is NOT the reverse movement that is allowed in Post Trip
orin Reversing mode.
5.12.1.5
The scope of this procedure is NOT Supervised Manoeuvre movements, during Which
the train orientation can change according to the last received SM authorisation and the
driver changes the running direction of the train without leaving the cab, by changing the
position of the direction controller from FORWARD to REVERSE.
5.12.2
The driver uses the same engine (a mission is ongoing)
5.12.2.1
The situation is the following: The driver closes the desk A and leaves the cab A of the
leading engine of the train, to go to cab B and open desk Bof this same engine.
5.12.2.2
Desk Aand desk Bare connected to the same ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment
5.12.2.3
When the driver closes the deskA
the ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment immediately
goes to Stand-By mode, which is considered as an end of mission (see
End of Mission"
procedure).
5.12.2.4
When the driver opens the desk B, the "Start of Mission" procedure is triggered。
5.12.2.5
When the
driver closes
3
desk and opens the other one
of the same engine;
the
ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment shall be able to calculate the new train position data
(train front position, train orientation), by use of the previous data。
5.12.3
The driver leaves the engine to go to another one
5.12.3.1
The described situation is the following: The train has two engines (engine Aand engine
B). The engine Ais the leading engine. The engine Bis a slave engine. Each engine has
its own ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment。
a) If engine Bis remote controlled, its ETCS on-board equipment is in Sleeping mode。
Note: The mode is entered when on-board equipment detects the presence of the
"remote control" signal。

b) If the slave engine is not remote controlled (Tandem operation) by the leading engine
but there is a driver who controls the engine; then the on-board equipment is in Non
leading mode。
If the engine Bis not remote controlled (Tandem Shunting operation) by the leading
engine and there is no driver Who controls the engine, then the on-board equipment
is in Passive Shunting mode.
5.12.3.2
Assumption: The train configuration does not change.
a) When changing the train orientation, the leading engine
4
Will become the slave
engine, and the slave engine B will become the leading engine.
b) If before the change of train orientation engine B was in SL, afterwards engine
A Will
bein SLmode; If before the change oftrain orientation engine B was in NL , afterwards
engine A will be in NL mode; If before the change of train orientation engine B was in
PS, afterwards engine A will be in PS mode.
5.12.3.3
Case "Engine B was in SL mode"
5.12.3.3.1
The driver of engine A closes the desk, then the ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment of
engine A switches to Stand-By mode. If the train has a mission, this is a end of mission
(see "End of Mission
procedure)
5.12.3.3.2
As soon as the remote control signal disappears, the ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment
of engine B switches to Stand-By mode。
5.12.3.3.3
Level 2: The ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment of engine B opens a communication
session (讦 possible) and reports the mode change to the RBC.
5.12.3.3.4
When the driver opens a desk of engine B he triggers the "Start of Mission" procedure.
5.12.3.4
Case "Engine B was in NL mode"
5.12.3.4.1
The driver of engine
A selects "Non Leading"
The ERTMSIETCS equipment switches
to Non Leading mode。
5.12.3.4.2
Once the non leading input signal is not received any more, the ERTMSIETCS on-board
equipment of engine B Will switch to Stand-By mode (refer to SRS chapter 4, transitions
between modes and chapter 5, "End of Mission" procedure)。
5.12.3.4.3
Because the desk is open, When the ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment enters Stand-
By mode; the "Start of Mission" procedure is triggered.
5.12.3.5
Case
Engine B was in PS mode"
5.12.3.5.1
The driver of engine A selects "Continue Shunting on desk closure"
The ERTMSIETCS

joined. The "joining train" is the train performing the joining operation.
5.14.2
Procedure "Splitting"
5.14.2.1
Step
The electrical and mechanical links between the two trains must be removed
(this is a national operational procedure; out of the scope of the SRS).
5.14.2.1.1
Note: If splitting requires moving the two train
apart from each other for a small
distance, this can be done even in SB mode
5.14.2.2
Step 2a -
Ifthe ERTMSIETCS onboard equipment which was supervising the train before
splitting has
not
performed
an
end of mission for splitting, the
Train
Data
must be
modified (e.9. by the driver) such that it fits with the new train composition after splitting。
For level 2, the new train data is sent to the RBC (see SRS chapter 3
Data
Modification Process)
5.14.2.3
Step 2b
If an ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment of the "new train after splitting'
WaS
in Sl
mode before;
i Will Switch
to SB
mode
once the remote control signal is not
received
any
more
(refer
tO
SRS
chapter
4
transitions
between
modes):
For Level 2: The ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment opens a communication session (讦
possible) and reports the mode change to the RBC.
5.14.2.4
Step 2c
Ifan ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment of the "new train after splitting'
WaS
in NL mode before; i Will switch to SB mode once the non leading input signal is not
received any more (refer to SRS chapter 4, transitions between modes and chapter 5,
"end of mission'
procedure).
5.14.2.5
The driver can then start a new mission with this "new train after splitting" (refer to the
"Start Of Mission" procedure)  In all cases, to start a mission is not the only possibility。
Shunting movements, or not moving the new train at all, are also possible。
5.14.3
Procedure "Joining"
5.14.3.1
Step
The "joining train" must approach the "train to be joined" . This can be performed
in SR, OS, SMor SH mode (depending on the information available, and on the national
procedure for joining)

Step 2
The electrical and mechanical links between the two trains must be closed
(vehicle dependent, outside the scope of the ETCS).
5.14.3.3
Step 3a
If a former leading ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment remains leading and
there Was no end of mission, the driver must modify the Train Data such that it fits with
the new train composition.
For level 2, the new train data is sent to the RBC (see SRS
chapter 3
Data Entry
Modification Process)
5.14.3.4
Step 3b
If a former leading ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment is to become slave
equipment in SL mode, when closing the desk, the ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment
Will switch to SB mode (see SRS chapter 4, transitions between modes) and the end of
mission procedure is executed (see
End of Mission" procedure). Transition to SL mode
is from SB mode.
5.14.3.5
Step 3c
If a former leading ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment is to become slave
equipment in NL mode; the driver selects
NL mode (see SRS chapter 4, transitions
between modes).

that gives the Mode Profile。
When the train passes the balise group and receives this
information, the ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment shall immediately switch to Limited
Supervision mode.
5.19.2.2
In a level 2 area, the ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment can receive
a mode profile
giving a Limited Supervision area Which the train position confidence interval already
overlaps. If starting from the min safe front end of the train this Limited Supervision area
is the furthest area that the train position confidence interval overlaps within the mode
profile;
the
ERTMSIETCS
on-board equipment shall immediately switch
to
Limited
Supervision mode.

Within the driver acknowledgement time (refer to
Appendix A.3.1) after the change to LS mode;
the service brake command shall be
triggered。
5.19.2.5
Note: Once in Limited Supervision mode; the speed supervision is such that the train
speed cannot exceed the LS mode speed limit. If, when entering the Limited Supervision
mode, the train speed was higher than the LS mode speed limit (because a higher speed
Was allowed in Full Supervision mode; in Automatic Driving mode, in On Sight mode or

Procedure Inhibition of balise transmission alarm reaction
5.22.1
Introduction
5.22.1.1
As explained in 3.15.7, when the balise reading antenna is over a large metallic object
that exceeds the Subset-036 limits (something usually called "Big Metal Mass" and in the
following referred to as "BMM") an alarm may be generated by the balise transmission
system, Which in turn may trigger an on-board safe reaction。
5.22.1.2
Such "integrity check alarm of balise transmission" (in the following:
BTM alarm'
that
may be generated when the balise antenna is over a
BMM is not distinguishable from
one that may be generated when the on-board balise reader system is in failure。
5.22.1.3
Since it is not possible for the on-board to know whether the alarm was generated by a
failure (and therefore the on-board may be unable to read balises) or by the presence of
a BMM under the balise antenna, i is possible that a safe reaction is taken by the on-
board (for example switch to SF) when it is in fact still able to read balises。
5.22.1.4
The track condition
Big Metal Mass" provides a means fortrackside to mark areas Where
BMMs are known to exist, and so to avoid that the on-board may take a safe reaction
when there is no need to (the on-board is able to detect balises but the antenna is over
3
BMM).
5.22.1.5
However, there may be instances Where the train is over a known BMM but the related
track condition is not available on-board . For example; because the train is awakening
on a metal covered area or because the driver had to select override and move the train
over a metal covered area。
This can result in deadlocks.
5.22.1.6
To avoid that, the procedure detailed in this section provides a
means for the driver to
inhibit the potential safe reaction to a BTMalarm. This in turn enables a SoM or a generic
movement oVer a
BMMin an ETCS equipped area (level
1
Or 2) when no
BMN track
condition is stored on-board.
5.22.1.7
Note: The driver should Use the "Inhibition'
procedure only when authorised to do SO_
This authorisation should be covered by operational procedures because to inhibit a safe
reaction may be detrimental to safety。
5.22.1.8
In addition, a provision is introduced to allow the procedure to be automatically triggered
without driver intervention. This provision applies in case the train is in an area covered
bya BMM track condition stored on board, and the track condition gets reset (for example
because of a transition to SR mode caused by Override activation).
5.22.2
Manual triggering of the procedure
5.22.2.1
The ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment shall allow the driver to select "Inhibition of
reaction to BTM alarm" only at standstill when the level is
Or2 and the current mode is
Stand-By, Shunting, or Staff Responsible.

5.22.2.2
As soon as the driver makes the selection, the "Inhibition" procedure shall be triggered。
5.22.3
Automatic triggering of the procedure
5.22.3.1
As soon as a stored BMM track condition is reset, the "Inhibition" procedure shall be
automatically triggered provided that at the time of the reset the Eurobalise antenna is in
an area Where that track condition is reset, taking into account the max and min safe
antenna positions.
5.22.3.1.1
Exception: the automatic triggering of the
Inhibition" procedure shall not apply in case
the reset is caused by a transition to NP or RV mode:
5.22.4
Once the "Inhibition" procedure has been triggered
5.22.4.1
An indication shall be given to the driver, until the procedure is ended。
5.22.4.2
potential on-board reaction to a "BTM alarm
shall be inhibited.
5.22.5
End of 'Inhibition
procedure
5.22.5.1
The "Inhibition" procedure shall end When at least one of the following conditions is
fulfilled:
a) The train has run more than the fixed distance defined in A.3.1 after the procedure
was triggered, OR
b) The ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment switches to a mode different than Standby,
Shunting or Staff Responsible, OR
C) The driver ends the procedure; by revoking the inhibition.
5.22.5.2
Regarding a) above, the distance is the one travelled away from the location When the
procedure was triggered and it shall be applicable in both directions。
5.22.5.2.1
Exception: xf a BMM track condition Which announces a BMM area within the remaining
distance of the manual or automatic inhibition is received, the distance for ending the
procedure shall be shortened to the start of the announced BMM area。
5.22.5.3
Note: the
driver may revoke the inhibition following
an operational procedure。
For
example; in the case of awakening over a BMM the train has moved past the limit of the
metallic covered
area
and SO there is
n0
more need to
have the inhibition active。
Revoking the inhibition in turn increases safety, because it allows the on-board to have
a safe reaction should there be a failure in the balise reader system that was until then
"masked" by the inhibition set manually or automatically.

7.3
Components Of ERTMSIETCS Language
7.3.1
Introduction
7.3.1.1
The ERTMSIETCS language is used in transmitting information over the radio; balise
and loop airgaps。
7.3.1.2
The ERTMSIETCS language is based on variables, packets, messages and telegrams
(variables and packets are described in this section, While telegrams and messages are
described in chapter 8).
7.3.1.3
Note: A
number of variables contain values Which have to be assigned. Some of these
values have to be unique to ensure that the system functions properly. A centralised
handling of this assignment is therefore required (nationally or internationally, depending
on the variable). The variables concerned have been marked. The values included in this
document for these variables are therefore not to be used Without prior verification of
their validity. See SUBSET-054 for further details。
7.3.2
Definition of Variables
7.3.2.1
Variables are used to encode single data values. Variables cannot be split in minor units.
The whole variable has one type (meaning).
7.3.2.2
Variables may have special values which are related to the basic meaning ofthe variable。
7.3.2.3
Special Values have always the highest values in a variable (e.9.32767
'unknown" )
7.3.2.4
Spare Values are located between the normal and special values in the variable range
7.3.2.5
Names of variables
are unique。
A
Variable is
used in context With the meaning
35
described in the variable definition。
Variables with different meanings have different
names。
7.3.2.6
AII variable definitions are independent of the transport media over Which
are Used;
讦 used in more than one media。
7.3.2.7
Signed values shall be encoded as 2's complement。
7.3.2.8
One bit variables (Boolean) always use 0 for false and
for true。
7.3.2.9
Offsets for numerical values are avoided (0 is used for 0
1 for 1,etc. ) except Where
justified.
7.3.2.10
When transmitting over the different transmission media, the most significant bit shall be
transmitted first。
7.3.2.11
AII Variables have one of the following prefixes:
Acceleration
0
distance

7.3.3
Definition of Packets
7.3.3.1
Packets are multiple variables grouped into a single unit, with a defined internal structure.
7.3.3.2
This structure consists of a packet header with:
Track to
Train:
3
unique packet number;
the length
Of the packet in
bits,
the
orientation information, optionally the scale for distancellength information and an
information section containing a defined set of variables。
The packet structure is as
folloWs:
Number
NID_PACKET
Packet identifier
Direction
DIR
Specifies the validity direction of
transmitted data
Length
PACKET
Number of bits in the packet
Scale
SCALE
Specifies Which scale is used for
distancellength
information
within the packet。
There is no Q_SCALE variable
in packets Which do not contain
distance information.
Information
Well defined set(s) of variables。
Train to Track: a unique packet number, the length of the packet in bits, optionally
the distance scale and an information section containing a defined set of variables。
The packet structure is as follows:
Number
NID_
PACKET
Packet identifier
Length
PACKET
Number of bits in the packet
Scale
SCALE
Specifies Which scale is used for
distancellength
information
within the packet。
There is no Q_SCALE variable
in packets Which do not contain
distance information.

Information
Well defined set(s) of variables。
7.3.3.3
The packet definition does not change when transmitted
over different transmission
media。
7.3.3.4
AlI packet identifiers not listed in 7.4.1.1 shall be considered as invalid values (i.e. like
Spare Values)
when
received
by
the on-board equipment。
Exception: reception
Of
information only differing by

with regards to the highest system version number X
supported by on-board (refer to section 3.17.3.11).
7.3.3.4.1
Note: Depending on the system version number with which the messageltelegram Was
transmitted relevant exception from chapter 6 may apply regarding 7.4.1.1.
7.3.3.5
Exception: Packet 0 "Virtual Balise Cover marker" and Packet 255: "End of Telegram'

7.3.3.6
N_ITER specifies the number of iterations of a variable or group ofvariables Which follow.
7.3.3.7
If N_ITERis 0 then no variables follow.
7.3.3.8
TWo ormore nested levels of iterations can exist。
7.3.3.9
If, depending on the value of a previous qualifier variable in the packet, a Variable is
optional, it is written indented in the packet definition
7.3.3.10

trackside device (balise,
RIlU, RBC) can transmit this packet。
Any" means that the
packet can be transmitted by a balise, a loop, an RBC and a RIU。
7.3.3.10.1
Row "Transmitted to" in the description of a packet specifies to Which ERTMSIETCS
trackside device the packet can be transmitted.

Introduction
8.3.1
Scope and Purpose
8.3.1.1
This chapter defines the format and content of messages necessary for ERTMSIETCS
functions.
8.3.1.2
Concerning the transmission media, this chapter does not cover considerations such as
medium-specific use constraints (e.9-
distance between track-circuit and balise.
)
35
well as functions (e.9. detection of balise reference; time and location stamp, identifying
type of receiving balise,
Management, Releasinglmaintaining a radio connection...)
and performance of the transmission media。
8.3.2
Definitions
8.3.2.1
Transmission
media considered
hereafter
are standard
ERTMSIETCS transmission
media used for ETCS (Eurobalise; Euroradio and Euroloop):
8.3.2.2
message includes user data (application level) and protocol data (depending on the
transmission medium).
8.3.2.3
Eurobalise message is the information sent by a balise group (i.e. the message is
composed of one or several telegrams, sorted by balise number in the group (telegram
from balise number
1
first), each telegram is transmitted by a Eurobalise). A Eurobalise
telegram contains one header and an identified and coherent set of Packets。

8.4.1.6
Note:
For the purposes of clause 8.4.1.4,
when the same packet is transmitted by
duplicated balises, this is considered to be only a single instance of the packet within the
message. Justification: The on-board equipment will only use one of these duplicated
telegrams (and therefore only one setof duplicated packets) to compose the balise group
message (see 3.16.2.4.8.2)

When used, the packet 0 shall be transmitted as the first packet of the telegram (i.e.it is
appended to the header):
8.4.2.4
Note: If there is an active VBC stored on-board and in order to find a VBC marker, the
ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment needs first to check M
VERSION:
If M_VERSION = 0.Y, the telegram will be ignored;
If M
VERSION = 1.0, there will be no VBC marker;
If M
VERSION = 1.1, the on-board must look for a packet 200 (see chapter 6);
In all other cases (including when M_VERSION is higher than the highest system
version supported by the on-board), the on-board must look for a packet 0_

If a
packet 0 or 200 is found, the ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment must also check
whether NID_C matches the VBC marker included in the packet 0 or 200. This implies
that in all future system versions the size and location OfM_
VERSIONand NID_C inside
the header, the overall size of the header and the positionlcontent of the packet 0
appended to it, Will remain invariant。

Introduction
9.3.1
Scope and Purpose
9.3.1.1
Chapter 9 lists a classification into categories of all the clauses in the chapters
to 8 of
the SRS.
9.3.1.2
The purpose
Of this chapter is to
ease the assessment Of the compliance Of
an
ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment with the SRS.
9.3.1.3
To
that
effect;
this
chapter
comprehensively
identifies
Which
Clauses
contain
requirements allocated to the ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment and conversely Which
ones do not, either because they contain requirements allocated to the ERTMSIETCS
trackside only or because they are of another type
9.3.2
Definitions
9.3.2.1
The following categories are used to classify each SRS clause:
ERTMSIETCS On boardrequirement: a clause containing requirement(s) that must
be fulfilled by a SRS compliant ERTMSIETCS on-board
b) ERTMSIETCS tracksiderequirement: a clause containing requirement(s) that must
be fulfilled by a SRS compliant ERTMSIETCS trackside; in case the corresponding
function is implemented
Definition: a clause that is a necessary prerequisite to the correct interpretation of
requirement(s) or without which requirementfs) cannot be unambiguously interpreted
Iormative: a clause that helps the reader to better understand the context or the
justification of requirement(s)
Others: a clause that does not belong to any of the above categories
9.3.2.2
Throughout the SRS, the requirements are identified as sentences using the keyword
"shall. However:
a) In section 9.4, tables are identified as a single entity through a reference based on
the accompanying clause number. They can be classified as ERTMSIETCS on-board
andlor trackside requirements even if they do not include the keyword "shall.
b) Elements of the ERTMSIETCS language (radio messages; packets and variables,
see chapters
7 and 8)are also described with tables。
The numbered titles (i.e.the
name of the element preceded by a clause number) together with their associated
table are considered as single entities and are classified as both ERTMSIETCS on-
board and trackside requirements;
even 讦 they do not include the keyword "shall"
either。
9.3.2.3
Amongst the categories listed in 9.3.2.1 only the two first ones can be combined, in case
3
requirement
equally
applies
to
both
ERTMSIETCS
on-board
equipment
and
ERTMSIETCS trackside or in case two unambiguously distinguishable on-board and
trackside requirements are kept together in the concerned clause for readability reasons。
