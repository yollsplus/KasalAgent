Introduction
1.3.1.1
Train control is an important part of any railway operations management system. In the
past a number of different Automatic Train Control (ATC) systems have evolved in
different
countries
at
different
times。
These   systems
are
incompatible
and
not
interoperable with each other. Only a few of these systems are used in more than one
country, and even in those cases there have been differences in detailed development
which have resulted in incompatible and not interoperable versions。
1.3.1.2
Many railways anticipate
a
significant increase
in
density
Of train
traffic
and
are
rethinking their infrastructure strategy, to accommodate high levels of traffic, in Which
ATC systems play
an important part。
AIsO
many railways
would
like to introduce
standardised systems
to
reduce system
COsts.
In
order
to
establish international
standardisation of ATC systems, the following document specifies the European Rail
Traffic Management SystemlEuropean Train Control System (ERTMSIETCS).
1.4
Advantages of an International Interoperable System
1.4.1.1
The advantages expected by the railways can be summarised as:
Cross border interoperability.
Improvement of the safety of national and international train traffic.
Improvement of international passengers and freight train traffic management.
Shorter headway on heavily trafficked lines; by driving
on moving block enabling
exploitation of maximum track capacity。
The possibility of step-by-step introduction of the new technology.
Enabling Pan-European competition between the manufacturers of ERTMSIETCS
components. Strengthening the position of the European railway industry on the
World market.
Enabling
preconditions
for
future
harmonisation
in
other
areas
Of
rail
traffic
management。

Furthermore,
the
different application
levels
permit
the   interfacing
of
individual

2.6.2.5
Levels 1,2 and 3 are downwards compatible:
This means that:
a level 3 equipped train is also able to operate in level 0, level
and level 2
a level 2

installed onboard, the ERTMSIETCS Onboard system may need to be interfaced to it,
in order to perform the transitions fromlto the national system andlor in order to give
access to ERTMSIETCS Onboard resources (e.9.

lineside
signal clears;
an approaching
train
can
not
receive
this
information until it passes the Eurobalise group at that signal. The driver therefore has
to observe the lineside signal to know When to proceed。
The train
has then to be
permitted
to approach
the stopping location
below
a
maximum permitted
release
speed。
2.6.5.1.8
Additional Eurobalises can be placed between distant and main signals to transmit infill
information, the train will receive new information before reaching the signal。
2.6.5.1.9
Note: Lineside signals are required in level
applications, except 讦 semi-continuous
infill is provided。
2.6.5.1.10
Semi-continuous infill can be provided using Euroloop or radio infill. In this case;
the
on-board system will be able to show new information to the driver as soon as i is
available and even at standstill.
2.6.5.1.11
Euroloop or radio infill can improve the safety of a level

Introduction
3.3.1
Scope and purpose
3.3.1.1
The chapter 3, Principles; specifies the system principles of ETCSIERTMS。
These
principles apply to on-board and trackside subsystems.
3.3.1.2
The principles define the operational and technical behaviour of the system in general
and functional terms。
3.3.1.3
The
chapter
is
divided
into
subchapters。
In
each
subchapter
normally
Several
requirements
are defined.
Each requirement is identified with
3
unique identification
number。
3.3.1.4
Notes, Justifications and Examples are only informative and shall not be regarded as
requirements:
3.4
Balise configuration and linking
3.4.1
Balise Configurations
Balise Group Definition
3.4.1.1
balise group shall consist of between one and eight balises。
3.4.1.2
In every balise shall at least be stored:
3)
The internal number (from
to 8) of the balise
b) The number of balises inside the group
The balise group identity。
3.4.1.3
The internal number of the balise describes the relative position of the balise in the
grOUP.
3.4.2
Balise Co-ordinate System
3.4.2.1.1
Every balise group has its own co-ordinate system。
3.4.2.1.2
The orientation of the co-ordinate system of a balise group (i.e.
nominal Or reverse
direction) is identified as balise group orientation.
3.4.2.2
Balise groups composed of two or more balises
3.4.2.2.1
The origin of the co-ordinate system for each balise group shall be given by the balise
number
(called location reference) in the balise group.
3.4.2.2.2
The
nominal direction of each
balise group is defined by increasing internal balise
numbers.

report based on two balise groups reporting the train position in reference to the LRBG
and the "previous LRBG", ifany。
3.4.2.3.3.1.1
Note: Receiving this type of position report advises the RBC of the need to assign a
co-ordinate system to this single balise group。
3.4.2.3.3.2 When a single balise group is detected and the previous LRBG is known, the position

Balise Information Types and Usage
3.4.3.1
In
level
1 ,
all information to
the on-board system is given from
balise groups
Or
additionally from
EUROLOOPS
Or
Radio Infill
Units (see section 3.9).
In level 2/3,
balise groups are mostly used for location information。
3.4.3.2
balise may contain directional information, i.e. valid either for nominal or for reverse
direction;
Or
may
contain
information
Valid
for
both
directions.
In
level
1,
this
information can be of the following type (please refer to section 3.8.5):
a) Non-infill
b) Intentionally deleted
Infill.
3.4.3.2.1
Intentionally deleted.
3.4.3.2.2
Note: Infill information is referring to the location reference of an announced balise
group.
3.4.3.3
Some information shall be read also in sleeping mode and when no linking information
is
available
(see
Chapter
4

such information
is
transmitted by balises, and 讦 the information is directional, balise groups consisting of
at least two balises shall be Used.
3.4.4
Linking
3.4.4.1
Introduction
3.4.4.1.1
Aim of linking:
To determine
Whether
3
balise group has been missed
Or
not found within the
expectation Window (see section 3.4.4.4) and take the appropriate action。
To assign a co-ordinate system to balise groups consisting of a single balise。
To correct the confidence interval due to odometer inaccuracy (see section 3.6.4).
3.4.4.1.2
balise group is linked when its linking information (see section 3.4.4.2) is known in
advance.
3.4.4.1.2.1
Note: In cases Where a balise group contains repositioning information, the term linked
also
applies since the
balise group is
announced,
marked
as linked
and contains
repositioning information marked accordingly.
3.4.4.2
Content of linking information
3.4.4.2.1
Linking information shall be composed of:
a) The identity of the linked balise group.
b) Where the location reference of the group has to be found。

The accuracy Of this location.
Note: If the reference balise is duplicated,i is the trackside responsibility to define
the location accuracy to cover at least the location of the two duplicated balises。
d) The direction With Which the linked balise group will be passed over (nominal or
reverse).
The reaction required if a data consistency problem occurs with the expected balise
group。
3.4.4.2.1.1 "Linking
information
is
Used"
Shall
be
interpreted
35
when
balise group(s)
are
announced and the minimum safe antenna position has not yet passed the expectation
window of the furthest announced balise group。
3.4.4.2.2
Instead of the identity of a linked balise group it shall be possible to identify a following
linked balise group as unknown but containing repositioning information
3.4.4.2.2.1 Intentionally deleted.
3.4.4.2.2.2 Note 1: Regarding the repositioning information, see chapter 3.8.5.3.5 and 3.8.5.2。
3.4.4.2.2.3 Note 2:
In
case the identity of the
next balise group is
not unambiguously
known
because the route is not known by the trackside; this feature allows to link this balise
group.
3.4.4.2.3
For each linked balise group, the trackside shall select one of the following reactions to
be used in case of data inconsistencies:
a) Train trip (Trip mode; see Chapter 4)
b) Command service brake
C)
No reaction
For further details see section 3.16.2.
3.4.4.3
Unlinked Balise Groups
3.4.4.3.1
balise group, Which contains information that must be considered even when the
balise group is not announced by linking, is called an unlinked balise group。
3.4.4.3.2
Unlinked balise groups shall consist at minimum of two balises。
3.4.4.3.3
Unlinked balise groups shall always contain the unlinked balise group qualifier。
3.4.4.4
Rules related to linking
3.4.4.4.1
When
n0
linking information is used on-board,all balise groups shall be taken into
account。
3.4.4.4.2
When linking information is used on-board, only balise groups marked as linked and
included in the linking information and balise groups marked as unlinked shall be taken
into account.

3.4.4.4.2.1
When linking information is used on-board and the expected balise group is referred in
the linking information with a balise group With ID 'unknown'
a balise group marked as
linked shall only be taken into account 讦:
8) the on-board equipment can determine the orientation of the linked balise group by
information from
the balise group itself (therefore excluding
for example single
balise groups), AND
b) the balise group
contains repositioning information valid for the train orientation;
AND
the balise group is crossed with the direction announced in the linking information.
3.4.4.4.3
The on-board equipment shall accept a balise group marked as linked and included in
the linking information (i.e. the balise giving the location reference) from
When the max safe front end of the train has passed the first possible location of
the balise group
Until
the min safe front end of the train has passed the last possible location of the
balise group
taking the offset between the front of the train and the balise antenna into account。
3.4.4.4.3.1
Note: The first possible location and the last possible location of the balise group are
defined by the linking distance and the location accuracy。
3.4.4.4.3.2 Note:
The interval between
the outer limits to accept the
balise group
defines the
expectation Window。
3.4.4.4.4
In case of a balise group containing repositioning information, the first possible location
shall start from the previously linked balise group。
3.4.4.4.5
The on-board
equipment shall expect balise groups one by one (i.e.
i shall supervise
only
one
expectation
window
at
3
time) according
to
the
order given
by linking
information.
3.4.4.4.6
The ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment shall stop expecting a balise group and shall
expect the next one announced in the linking information (讦 any) when:

Movement authority
3.8.1
Characteristics ofa MA
3.8.1.1
The following characteristics can be used in a Movement Authority (see Figure 17:
Structure ofan MA):
a) The End Of Authority (EOA) is the location to Which the train is authorised to move。

System Requirements Specification
Page 471200
3.4.0
Chapter 3

EEIG ERTMS USERS GROUP
b) The Target Speed at the EOA is the permitted speed at the EOA; When the target
speed is not Zero, the EOA is called the Limit of Authority (LOA).
This target speed
can be time limited.
C)
If no overlap exists,
the Danger Point is
3
location beyond the EOA that can be
reached by the front end of the train without a risk for a hazardous situation.
The end of an overlap (if used in the existing interlocking system) is a location
beyond the Danger Point that can be reached by the front end of the train without a
risk for a hazardous situation。
This additional distance is only valid for a defined
time.
e) A release speed is a speed limit under Which the train is allowed to run in the vicinity
of the EOA,
When the target speed is Zero。
One release speed can be associated
with the Danger Point, and another one With the overlap. Release speed can also
be calculated on-board the train (see section 3.13.9.4).
The MA can be split into several sections, The last one is called End Section。
A first time-out Value can be attached to each section. This Value Will be used for
the revocation of the associated route When the train has not entered into it yet. It is
called the Section time-out.
In addition, a second time-out value can be attached to the End Section of the
MA. This second time-out will be used for the revocation of the last section When i
is occupied by the train; it is called the End Section time-out。
3.8.1.2
The values of the time-outs possibly given in an MA shall take into account the time
elapsed from the start of validity of information to the sending of the message.
3.8.1.3
Note: A
Danger Point can be (not exhaustive list):
the entry point of an occupied block section (if the line is operated according to
fixed block principles)
the position of the safe rear end of a
train (讦 the line is operated according to
moving block principles)
the fouling point of a
Switch, positioned for a
route; conflicting with the current
direction of
movement of the
train (both for fixed
and
moving
block
mode
Of
operation)
3.8.1.4
Note: Traditionally the overlap is a piece of track (beyond the danger point), that is put
at disposal of a train, to guarantee a non hazardous situation, also in case the driver
should misjudge the stopping distance for the train. In ERTMSIETCS the overlap can
be used to improve the efficiency of the braking supervision。
3.8.1.5
Note: Time-out values can be given in the MA to cope with the following situations
depending on the interlocking operations, i.e. the timers on-board will only reflect the
situation trackside and when expired (on-board) the actions taken are restrictive:

8) Section time-out or time-out for the speed at the EOALOA: When
a signalman
requests a
route release of a part of a
route not yet entered by the approaching
train.
b) End Section time-out: When
the train
has entered the last
of a
route
the
automatic route release can be delayed to make sure that the train has come to a
standstill before any switches inside the route can be moved.
c) Time-out for an overlap: When the train has entered the last part of a route; the
overlap associated with the route remains valid for a certain time to make sure that
the train has successfully stopped before its end of authority。
If the overlap is still
unoccupied when the timer expires the interlocking revokes the overlap.
3.8.1.6
Note: If the trackside equipment does not have enough information to give the distance
to End Of Authority (with target speed equal to zero) a target speed higher than zero
can be given (speed at LOA,
Limit Of Authority)。
It is the responsibility Of the trackside
to ensure that the safe distance beyond the EOAILOA is
enough to brake the train
from
the target speed
to
a
stand
Still
without
any hazardous situation。
It
is
the
responsibility of the on-board equipment to apply the brakes 讦 no new information is
received when the Limit of Authority is passed.

In level 2/3, the following possibilities shall be available:
a) A defined time before the train reaches the pre-indication location (see section 3.13)
for the EOALOA assuming it is running at the warning speed.
b) A defined time before the Section timer (not the End Section timer, not the Overlap
timer) for any section of the MA expires, or before the LOA speed timer expires。
3.8.2.3.1
Regards to the above possibilities, the MA request shall be triggered when the train
front has passed the resulting location (regards a)l time (regards b)
3.8.2.4
It shall be possible to define whether the MA request shall be repeated until a new MA
is received or not and 讦f so, the time between each repetition。

no MA has been received, the request shall be repeated with a repetition cycle
according to a fixed value (see appendix).

3.9.3.5.1.1
The order shall be ignored in case i refers to an RIU with which a session is currently
established oris already established.
3.9.3.5.2
Case 2: the on-board can handle more than one communication session at a time。
In
this case,at the location indicated in the order the on-board shall:
a) terminate any communication session existing with RIU(s) not indicated in the order
b) as
Soon

If the order to establish a communication session with a radio infill unit sent via Radio
Infill unit is received by an on-board equipment:
a) If the on-board can
handle only one communication session, the order shall be
ignored.
b) If the on-board can
handle two communication sessions simultaneously and only
one session is ongoing, the existing communication session shall be maintained
and the new one shall be established.
If the on-board can
handle two communication sessions simultaneously and two
sessions are ongoing, then the communication session related to the current infill
area Shall be maintained,
the other one shall be terminated and the new one shall
be established.

Definition of Static Speed Restriction
3.11.2.1
Static Speed Restrictions are imposed by the trackside infrastructure, the train
characteristics, the signalling and the mode of the on-board equipment。
3.11.2.2
There are eleven categories of Static Speed Restrictions:
a) Static Speed Profile (SSP)
b) Axle load Speed Profile (ASP)
C)
Temporary Speed Restrictions (TSR)
d) Maximum Train Speed
e) Signalling related speed restriction (only level 1)
f)
Mode related Speed Restriction.

Static Speed Profile (SSP)
3.11.3.1.1
The Static Speed Profile (SSP) is a description of the fixed speed restrictions of a
given piece of track. The speed restrictions can be related to e.9. maximum line speed,
curves, points, tunnel profiles;
3.11.3.1.2
The Static Speed Profile is based on factors, Which are both track and train dependent。
The relationship between
track
and
train
characteristics
determines
the
individual
Static Speed Profile for each train.
3.11.3.1.3
It shall be possible for every element (distance between two discontinuities) of a static
speed profile to define;
讦
a transition to

It shall be possible to transmit several Static Speed Profile Categories; one Basic SSP
category and specific SSP categories related to the international train categories。
3.11.3.2.1.1
The specific SSP categories are decomposed into two types:
a) The "Cant Deficiency' SSP categories: the cant deficiency value assigned to one
category shall define the maximum speed, determined by suspension design; at
which a particular train can traverse a curve and thus can be used to set a specific
speed limit in a curve with regards to this category.
b) The "other specific" SSP categories: it groups all other specific SSP categories
corresponding to the other international train categories

Speed and distance monitoring
3.13.1
Introduction
3.13.1.1
The speed and distance monitoring is the supervision of the speed of the train Versus
its position; in
order to
assure that the
train
remains
within
the
speed and
distance limits.
3.13.1.1.1
Note: The speed and distance monitoring of the on-board can only assure this When
the following necessary conditions are fulfilled:
Brake system of the train functions as specified
wheellrail adhesion is sufficient for the required safe deceleration
Brake characteristics (and other Train Data) are correctly entered into the on-board
(automatic or by driver)
3.13.1.2
Note: The ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment triggers brake commands and revokes
them, i may also receive status information
i the brakes
are applied
Or released.
However, it cannot be made responsible 讦 brake control circuits outside the equipment
fail. Also the way the brakes are released by the driver after a revocation of a brake
command is an implementation issue。
3.13.1.3
Figure
28 gives
an overview of the
main elements contributing to the speed and
distance monitoring.
These elements (inputs, functions and outputs) are detailed in the

board and the moment the brake force starts to build up.
b) T_brake_increase (+1 ...t2) is the interval in Which the brake force increases from the
Zero to the moment when 95% of full brake power is reached.

Conversion Models
3.13.3.1
Introduction
3.13.3.1.1
For trains with variable composition (loco hauled trains), the brake characteristics can
Vary together with the composition of the train. In this case,i is not convenient to pre-
program the brake parameters necessary to calculate the braking
CUrVeS。
The only
practical way to obtain the correct values for the current train composition is to include
them into the data entry process by the driver. However;
i cannot be expected from
the driver to know deceleration values and brake build up times。
Conversion models
are
therefore
defined
to
convert
the
parameters
entered
by
the
driver
(brake
percentage and brake position) into the parameters of the corresponding brake model。
3.13.3.1.2
Note: The process for defining the input parameters for the conversion model (brake
percentage
and
brake
position)
is
outside
the
SCODe
Of
the
ERTMSIETCS
specifications。
3.13.3.2
Applicability of the conversion models
3.13.3.2.1
The
conversion
models
shall
be
Used
by
the
on-board
equipment
讦
the
brake
percentage is acquired
as part of Train Data,
and 讦 the maximum train speed, the
brake percentage and the train length are all within the following Validity limits of the
conversion models:
a) 0 < Vs 200, where Vis the maximum train speed in kmlh
b)30 <A< 250, where A is the brake percentage in %
C) 0 <L < Lmax, where Lis the train length in m and where Lmax = 900 m x the brake
position is Passenger train in P
OrLmax
1500 m if the brake position is "Freight
train in P" or "Freight trainin G
3.13.3.2.1.1
Note: The overspeed above the maximum train speed Which may occur due to the
ceiling speed margins is taken into account in the definition of the conversion model。
3.13.3.2.2
For trains not fitting into at least one of those validity limits, it is still possible to acquire
the brake percentage
as Train Data, but the conversion models are
not applicable;
Which
means
that braking
models (i.e。
pre-programmed
deceleration  profiles and
brake build up times) shall be used by the speed and distance monitoring function.

Assuming that a fictive train front end would be at any location between the current
(actual) train front end location and the SvL , the acceleration due to the gradient shall
be determined using the lowest (taking the sign into account) gradient value given by
the gradient profile between the location of the fictive train front end and the location of
the fictive train rear end (see Figure 35)
3.13.4.3
Rotating mass
3.13.4.3.1
The influence of gradients shall be compensated for the rotating mass of the train (see
Figure 35).
3.13.4.3.1.1
Note: Since the rotating mass works like a flywheel (rotating inertia), the effect of
the gradient is reduced. Assume for instance a (theoretical) train without any rotating
mass, not braking, on
a downhill gradient from height
to height 2。
All the energy
added to the train When it goes from H1 to H2 is converted into linear forward motion.
This can be observed as an acceleration due to the gradient:
Now assume the same
train with part of the Weight rotating. If this train travels the same distance from H1 to
H2, the same amount of energy is added to the train。
But now a part of that energy is
converted into rotational motion and only the remaining part is converted into linear
forward motion.
The latter can be observed as an acceleration Which is less than for
the train without rotating mass。
3.13.4.3.1.2
Note: For the influence of the rotating mass on the deceleration due to the brake; i
is already taken into account in the values for the brake parameters。

The purpose of the emergency brake intervention supervision limit is to assure that the
train will remain within the various limits (in distancelspeed) imposed by the trackside.
3.13.9.1.3
The purpose
of all other supervision limits is to assist the driver in preventing

8) Time during Which the traction effort is still present: T_traction
b) Remaining time during Which the traction effort is not present: T

3.13.9.3.2.3
The traction time (T_Traction) shall be defined as follows:
a) When the traction cut-off is implemented:
T
traction = MAX((T_traction_cut_Off
(T_warning + T_bs2)) ; 0)
b) when the traction cut-off is not implemented: T
traction = T_traction_cut_Off
3.13.9.3.2.4
Note:
When the traction cut-off is implemented,
the traction
Cut-off command is

To avoid Very low values When Tbs is small, a
minimum is defined for T_indication;
giving the driver always enough time to operate the brake。

If the service brake feedback interface is available for Use then T_indication = 5s.
3.13.9.4
Release speed supervision limits
3.13.9.4.1
The release speed is a special ceiling speed limit, applicable in the Vicinity of the EOA。
The EBI supervision limit shall be equal to the release speed. There is no SBI,W, 尸|
supervision limit associated to the release speed。
3.13.9.4.2
Note: The release speed may be necessary for two reasons. One is that a train has to
be able to approach the EOA where the permitted speed reaches zero and might be
too restrictive to permit acceptable driving due to inaccuracy of the measured distance。
The other reason is that in a level
application the train has to be able to overpass the
balise when the signal clears。
For these two reasons a (Iow) release speed may be
given from trackside or may be calculated on board, based on the distance from the
EOA to the Supervised Location。
3.13.9.4.3
With each MA, it shall be possible for the trackside to:
Give the value of the release speed directly to the on-board, OR
b) Instruct the on-board to calculate the release speed, OR
Instruct the on-board to Use the national value
3.13.9.4.4
In case the MA does not identify the variant to be used orin case of LOA, no release
speed shall be supervised。

is the full responsibility of the infrastructure
manager to set the appropriate release speed with regard to the risk of passing the
Supervised Location。
3.13.9.4.6
The start location of the release speed monitoring (i.e。
where the EBI supervision limit
related to EBD is replaced with
an EBI
supervision limit equal to the release speed
Value) shall be the location of the most restrictive SBI supervision limit among the S811

When the Release Speed is calculated
on-board, the 58I2 supervision limit(s) related to other target(s), 讦 any, between the

For ergonomic reasons; the location of a pre-indication is independent of the
estimated speed。 If the pre-indication would be derived from an
EBD
or SBD curve
according to the estimated speed, then when the train is running at low speed the
driver would see the permitted speed already decrease While the DMIis still in ceiling
display。
That is not consistent for the driver and therefore the pre-indication is
independent of the estimated speed。
3.13.9.5.12Note 2: For trackside engineering reasons; the assumptions for the calculation of the
EBI supervision limit are necessary to obtain a fully predictable pre-indication location,
i.e. independent from the measured acceleration and speed confidence interval。

Determination of the operated system version
3.17.2.1
The on-board equipment shall be able to operate With (i.e。
shall support) any Of the
ERTMSIETCS system version numbers X included in the envelope of legally operated
system versions, as defined in chapter 6.
3.17.2.2
The on-board equipment shall operate with only one system version at a time; i.e。
计
shall behave according to the Whole set of requirements applicable to a system version
(refer to chapter 6
in
case the operated system version is older than the Iast one
introduced in this release of the SRS).
3.17.2.3
The on-board equipment shall determine the operated system version, in relation to
non-RBC trackside constituents, as the system Version number X transmitted by any
balise, loop
Or
RIU,
讦
this system
Version
number
X
is higher than the currently
operated one。
3.17.2.4
It shall be possible from balise group to order the on-board equipment to operate a
system version。
3.17.2.5
On receiving the order to operate system version from balise group, the
on-board
equipment shall immediately operate the system Version given in the order. After the
Order is executed,
the requirement 3.17.2.3 shall
be again applied for any further
received balise telegramlloop message or any further contacted RIU.
3.17.2.5.1
Note: the system Version order is to be used Wherever it is necessary to enforce an
operated system version number X lower than the currently operated one。
3.17.2.6
If a mismatch has been detected between the country or region identifier read from a
baliselloop and the corresponding identifier(s) for Which a set of national values is used
onboard,
the
on-board
equipment
shall
consider

3.17.2.7
If the on-board equipment does not support the system version number X transmitted
by a non-RBC trackside constituent or the one specified in the balise group order, i
Shall consider the operated system version as unchanged。
3.17.2.8
In case of communication session established With an RBC, the system version of the
RBC shall take precedence on the operated system version in relation to non-RBC
constituents and on
System Version ordered from balise group; the operated system
version shall be determined according to the following principles:
a) xf the on-board equipment is in level 0
NTC or
(e.9.
entrance in level 2/3 area);
the
RBC system
Version
shall
be operated
When
the
transition
to
level
2/3 is
executed;
b) i the on-board equipment is in level 2/3 (SoM procedure
Or order received from
trackside), the RBC system version shall be operated immediately;
in case of session established with an accepting RBC (RBCIRBC Handover), the
accepting RBC system version shall be operated as soon as the engine has passed
the RBCIRBC border location with its maximum Safe front end;
in case the on-board equipment switches from level 2/3 to another level (e.9. exit
from
3
level
2/3
area)
the  system
Version
control
in
relation
to
non-RBC
constituents shall
be
applied
and
the
balise group orders shall
be again
considered;
in
case the engine passes the RBC/RBC border location with its maximum safe
front end and no session is established with the accepting RBC, the system Version
control in relation to non-RBC constituents shall be again applied and the balise
group orders shall be again considered.
3.17.2.9
The System version currently operated when the on-board equipment is switched off
(i.e. enters No Power mode) shall be retained and re-used when powered on。
3.17.2.9.1
I
the
on-board   equipment

the
information
(failure
situation),
the

3.17.3
Handling of trackside data in relation to system version
3.17.3.1
Every telegram transmitted by a balise;
and every message transmitted by Euroloop
and Radio Infill Unit shall contain only the data related to one system version. It is not
allowed for the balise, Euroloop and Radio Infill Unit to transmit data correspondent to
SeVeral

a) the execution of a conditional emergency stop (3.10.2.2);
b) the reception of a shortened MA (3.8.5.1.3,3.8.5.1.4);
C) the stored MA is shortened due to a section time-out (3.8.4.2.2);
d) the Svl is shifted (to the DP xf any
Or to the EOA) due to
an
overlap time-out
(3.8.4.4.2)
巳
the stored MA is shortened due to an end section time-out (3.8.4.1.2);

cooperative MA revocation is granted by the onboard (3.8.6.2);
9) inconsistency in
a
balise group marked
as Unlinked and the train is at standstill
(3.16.2.5.2);
h) a linking reaction led to a service brake and the train is at standstill (3.16.2.6.2)
i
the reaction due to the supervision of the safe radio connection led to a service
brake and the train is at standstill (3.16.3.4.5b)

Handling of Actions in Specific Situations
A.3.5.1
Regards actions executed in reference to location information received from trackside;
the on-board equipment shall ensure that the action related to a location is neither
reverted,
nor
executed
twice
Situations
to
be
considered
shall
include
reVerse
movement (initiated
by
driver
Or
due
to roll-away)
and
the
sub-sequent forward
movement;
or adjustment of train position on passing
3
new LRBG.
This rule shall
apply to the following actions:
Change of National Values (see 3.18.2)
Request to acknowledge new level , level transition (see SRS chapter 5.10)
Start and stop displaying plain or fixed text messages (see 3.12.3)
Request to acknowledge a mode profile; mode transition due to mode profile (see
3.12.4)
Start and stop accepting radio infill information (see 3.9.3)
Actions related to RBC/RBC handover (see 3.15.1)
Actions related to track condition information (see 3.12.1) with the exception of big
metal masses and non stopping areas
Permission to initiate Reversing mode;ie.
limits of Reversing Area (see 3.15.4)
Start and stop Track Ahead free request to driver (see 3.15.5)"
Start and stop calculation of geographical position (see 3.6.6)
A.3.5.2
Once the ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment has received
3
balise group message
(i.e. once it has received the last balise telegram of the balise group), the action(s)
resulting from its content shall take into account the train position measured at the time
of reception of this last telegram and shall take precedence on any other action related
to a further location that is reached before the message has been fully processed.
A.3.5.2.1
Example 1: in level 1, the crossing of the EOAILOA location with the min safe antenna;
before
3
new extended MA (received When the min safe antenna
Was in rear of the
EOAILOA)
has
been
processed,
Will
not
lead
to
train trip。
In
other
terms
te
replacement of the EOAILOA is considered by the on-board as happening before the

Example
2:
when
the
override function is active,
the crossing of the former EOA
location by the min safe antenna,
before a
i in SR" information (received when
the min safe antenna was in rear of the former EOA) has been processed, will not lead
to the end of the override procedure followed by a train trip due to "Stop if in SR". In
other terms;
both the deletion of the former EOA and the end of override procedure

location dependent static speed restrictions
ie., SSP,ASP, TSR, LX SR, PBD SR
(see 3.11.2.2)
gradient information,
reduced adhesion information received from trackside;
Track condition
Big metal masses".
A3.6.2.1.1

on-board equipment
to
calculate speed
supervision limits after a reverse movement (roll-away, or initiated by the driver)
Track condition "Big metal masses" is needed also for a reverse movement itself to
avoid any false alarms due to Big metal masses in the track。
A3.6.2.1.2
Note: The distance to intervention of the roll away or reverse movement supervision is
determined by a NationallDefault value。
This is also true for a reverse movement in
Post trip mode。
However, following an intervention,
the train Will not stop immediately。
In order to keep the on-board functionality simple;
a fixed distance Value Was chosen
to define an unambiguous location in rear of the train Where the above information is
no longer required and the related on-board storage capacity is made available again。

Service brake feedback
A.3.10.1
The purpose of service brake feedback is to reduce the distance between the SBI and
EBI supervision limits and between the SBI and SBD curves。

The on-board shall consider the service brake feedback as available for Use 讦:
8) The service brake feedback is implemented, AND
b) The national value does not inhibit its Use_

pressure and brake cylinder pressure。
The algorithms below are made for main brake
pipe pressure:
When brake cylinder pressure is used instead this shall be converted

Note: If T
bs1 and T_bs2 have been locked to Os and 2 $, the locking will remain until
the target
monitoring is left,
even 讦 the train speed comes below the target
speed。
This
avoids "jumping"
indications.
It
also
makes
计
possible
to
release the
brakes before
3
speed reduction, Without having the curves moving
back again。
It
might though result in emergency brake intervention 讦 the driver releases the brakes
too early。
But since EBI is not moved, this is not a safety issue。
To keep 2 $ between
the SBland
EBI enables the service brake to be activated first and thus may avoid
emergency brake。
A.3.10.6
Note:
If feedback
has started
but T
bs1
and
T_bs2
are
not locked, the feedback
function
will remain
active
until the target

4.4.20.1.11 When in Passive Shunting mode; the ERTMSIETCS on-board shall not manage level
transitions。
However;
an

transition
order
Or
3
conditional
level
transition order shall be stored and shall be evaluated only When another mode than
Shunting or Passive Shunting has been entered (i.e。
When the Shunting movement is
terminated).
4.4.20.1.12When receiving a communication session establishment order, the ERTMSIETCS on-
board in Passive Shunting mode shall not establish the communication session, but
shall store the RBC IDlphone number information.
4.4.20.1.13 When in Passive Shunting mode; the ERTMSIETCS on-board shall not manage RBC-
RBC hand-over, except for storing the RBC IDlphone number information given at the
RBCIRBC border.
4.4.20.1.14 Note: for the list of main functions related to this mode; refer to chapter 4.5 "Modes
and on-board functions'
4.4.20.1.15In case of balise group message consistency error (refer to 3.16.2.4.4 and 3.16.2.5.1),
the ERTMSIETCS onboard equipment shall not command the service brake.
4.4.20.2

Responsibilities
4.4.20.3.1
The ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment of an engine in Passive Shunting mode has
no responsibility for the train protection.
4.4.20.3.2
The notion of responsibility of the driver is not relevant for the Passive Shunting mode。
4.4.20.3.3
Note: The leading engine is responsible for the movement of the train。
It is then the
ERTMSIETCS
on-board
equipment
of the leading engine
that is fullylpartiallylnot
responsible for the train protection, with respect to its mode.

Each transition from a given mode receives a priority order (indicated by

Xis the
priority order) to avoid a conflict between the different transitions when they occur at
the same time (i.e.in the same clock cycle). P1 has a higher priority than P2。
4.6.1.5
Some transitions have received the same priority order. This has been decided when it
is obvious that these transitions cannot occur at the same time, and So can never lead
to a conflicting situation (for example; the RBC cannot give in the same time a MA for
FS and a MA for OS to a given engine; this is Why the transition "from SR to FS" and
the transition "from SR to OS" have the same priority order).

DMI depending on modes
4.7.1
Introduction
4.7.1.1
The DMI is an interface that allows the direct exchange of information between the
driver and the ERTMSIETCS onboard equipment. The indirect exchange of information
done via the train interface (e.9.
a drivers action
on the service brake used for the
service brake feedback, openinglclosing the desk) is not part of the DMI.
4.7.1.2
The device(s) used to select
'ERTMSIETCS onboard equipment poweredlunpowered'
is (are) not part of the DMl.
4.7.1.3
The device(s) used to selectlindicate "ERTMSIETCS onboard equipment isolatedlnot
isolated" is (are) part of the DM.
4.7.1.4
Intentionally deleted.
4.7.1.5
Information (input or output) only relevant for National System and not originated by
the ERTMSIETCS on-board is not included in the following section。
4.7.2

4.7.2.1.1
X = active: For a DMI output, this means that the output information shall be shown to
the driver When the ERTMSIETCS onboard equipment is in the mode indicated in the
column.
For a DMI input, this means that it shall be possible for the driver to enter this
information when the ERTMSIETCS onboard equipment is in the mode indicated in the
column).
4.7.2.1.2

Acceptance of received information
4.8.1
Introduction
4.8.1.1
The aim of this chapter is to give an overview Of Which information is accepted or
rejected depending on the state of the on-board (level, mode) and the nature of the
received information (transmission medium, type of information: infill or non-infill):
4.8.1.2
The following sections have to be interpreted by applying the filters as shown in Figure
3.
The first filter is detailed in section 4.8.3
Accepted information depending on the
level and transmission media",
the third filter in section 4.8.4
Accepted information
depending on the modes"
4.8.1.3
I
3
message
contains
level
transition information,
any
other information
in
that
message shall be evaluated considering the level transition information。
4.8.1.3.1
Information received in the same message as an immediate level transition order or a
conditional level transition order that causes a level transition shall be evaluated first
considering
the on-board currently operated level,
35
讦
3
level transition
order for
further location had been received (i.e. conditions [1],[2] or [6] of Figure 3, x applied,
Shall be automatically fulfilled). Then, 讦 relevant, it shall be immediately extracted from
the buffer and re-evaluated according to the new selected level。
4.8.1.4
Note:
As
Shown
in Figure
3,
information stored following
an announcement
Of
a
change of level,
is re-checked for acceptance
when
the level
has changed.
This
implies that;
When
the
level changes;
the
mode
js
for
3
Short
moment
Still
unchanged, until the stored information has been processed. The consequence for the
Third Filter is that information needs to be accepted for this short period also in modes
in Which this information is otherwise useless。
4.8.1.5
I
3
message contains infill information, this latter shall be evaluated considering all
other non-infill information in that message.
4.8.1.6
When evaluating trackside information received by radio or when re-evaluating a set of
information
released from
the transition buffer; linking information;
讦
any,
Shall be
evaluated prior to any other location related information.

4.8.2.2
Regarding 4.8.2.1
a:
In
Case
a
balise is
missed
Or
3
balise telegram
cannot
be
decoded, the information
'Inhibition of balise group message consistency reaction'
is
only used by the on-board equipment to inhibit the service brake reaction, While the
balise group message is rejected. If all the telegrams from a balise group are correctly
read,
the information
'Inhibition
Of
balise group
message consistency reaction",
讦
received, shall be ignored by the on-board equipment. Therefore this information need
not to be referred to in the following tables。
4.8.2.3
In case a balise telegram contains the information VBC marker and a countrylregion
identity that both match a stored VBC, the whole balise telegram is ignored and any
further check in
relation
to this balise telegram is irrelevant (refer to 3.15.9.3 b)。
Otherwise
the
information
VBC
marker;
讦
included
in
3
consistent
balise group
message, shall always be ignored by the ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment and need
not to be referred to in the following tables。
4.8.2.4
Note: with the exception of the data that is forwarded to a National System through the
STM interface (see 3.15.6 and SUBSET-035), What will happen to the data to be used
by applications outside ERTMSIETCS (e.9.
Whether i is discarded, forwarded to
an
external application, processed by a national function.. ) is outside the scope Of this
specification
and
is assumed

Handling of transition buffer in case of level transition announcement or
RBCIRBC handover
4.8.5.1
Ifan order to switch to level NTC, 1,2 or 3 at a further location has been received, the
ERTMSIETCS onboard equipment shall
be able to store in
a transition
buffer (see
figure 3, first filter) three sets of information obtained from three filtered messages。
4.8.5.2
I
a
RBC transition order has been received and the Handing Over RBC is still the
supervising
one; the ERTMSIETCS
onboard equipment shall be able to store in
3
transition buffer (see figure 3,
second filter) three sets of information obtained from
three filtered messages from the Accepting RBC.
4.8.5.2.1
Note: the term "set of information" refers to the part of a message being stored in the
transition buffer (i.e. information which is neither accepted
nor rejected immediately)
according
tO
the
conditions
Stated
in
4.8.3.1
[1]
and
[2] (for
level  transition)
Or
according to 4.8.2.1c (for RBCIRBC handover).
4.8.5.3
In case three sets of information are already stored in the transition buffer, any new set
to be stored shall replace the oldest one currently stored。
4.8.5.4
The sets of information stored in the transition buffer shall be deleted:
a) in case the level transition order is deleted or overwritten by another level transition
order for a different level, OR
b)in case the RBC transition order is deleted or overwritten by an order to switch to
another Accepting RBC,OR
C) in

one;
the sets of information stored in the transition
buffer shall be released and re-evaluated in the sequence
have been received.
4.8.5.6
This sequential re-evaluation of all the released information shall be a prerequisite to
any use by the on-board equipment (e.9.
it Will lead neither to an intermediate change
Of mode
nor to
3
change of information displayed to the driver) and shall obey the
following principles:
3) Starting from
the
information
currently
Used

moment
the
IevellRBC

effective;
the
ERTMSIETCS

equipment
shall
determine
the

by performing sequential
updates from the information released from the transition buffer, if accepted。
b) For each information update related to a re-evaluated set of information, the same
rules
shall apply

to information update related
to
new information accepted
outside a levellRBC transition context。

The information resulting from
this sequential update shall then
be used by the
ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment
4.8.5.7
Accepting re-evaluated Conditional Emergency Stop information according
to table
4.8.3 implies
that
the accepted
Conditional Emergency Stop information
may
be
accepted
Or rejected in
3 further step (see clause 3.10.2.2) depending
on the
given
stop location.
This decision,
based on the comparison between the min safe front end
position of the train at the time the message was received and the given stop location,
Shall be considered part of the evaluation process as it affects the further re-evaluation
of information stored in the transition buffer (see clause 3.10.2.4)
4.8.5.7.1
Note:
For the case of the Unconditional Emergency Stop information accepting the
information according to table 4.8.3 Will always lead to the train being tripped (see
clause 3.10.2.3) When re-evaluation of the transition buffer is completed. Information
accepted during re-evaluation of information stored in the transition buffer can then be
affected on transition to TR mode according to conditions in Table 4.10.
4.8.5.8
Note: The requirement to acknowledge an Emergency Stop information according to
clause 3.10.1.4,i.e., communicating to the RBC if the information has been accepted
(Conditional or Unconditional Emergency Stop) or rejected because the train has
passed the stop location (Conditional Emergency Stop only), applies to the time When
the information is used, immediately after the sequential update has been completed。
Regards acknowledging the reception of an emergency stop message, as for any
other information received from trackside, see clause 3.16.3.5.

Introduction
5.3.1
Scope and Purpose
5.3.1.1
This document defines the procedures that are necessary for interoperability Within the
scope Of ERTMSIETCS。
5.3.1.2
Each procedure is defined by a set of mandatory requirements and, where convenient,
is illustrated by a flowchart。
5.3.1.3
In case the condition(s) in chapter 4 triggering a
mode transition is(are) fulfilled, this
transition shall be executed even if not shown in the chapter 5 procedures。
5.3.1.3.1
Note: Such a mode transition could lead to exiting a procedure immediately (e.9. cut
Off power of on-board equipment, isolation of on-board equipment).
5.3.1.4
National operation rules (outside of ERTMSIETCS) are also excluded,
but may be
applied by the railways in addition to the procedures
as long
as interoperability is
retained.
5.3.2
Definitions
5.3.2.1
Procedures
procedure defines the required reaction of the ERTMSIETCS entities (subsystems
and components) to either information exchanged between ERTMSIETCS entities or
events (triggered by external entities or internal events)
The procedures focus on the
required change in status and mode of the described ERTMSIETCS entities。
5.3.2.2
Entities
The procedures define the required system behaviour on
3
context level;
.
e
the
entities
that
are
used
to
define
the procedures
are
for
example:
the
on-board
equipment, the trackside equipment (RBCIBalise), the driver。
5.3.2.3
States
States are situations of an ETCS subsystem with a specific set Of available functions
and
a
specific set of events that
start or terminate the state.
A
state remains
active as long as the conditions to trigger the transition to a succeeding state are not
completely satisfied。
Note 1: one mode of operation may include several states for the on-board equipment
Note 2: A new state is only created, 讦 the behaviour of the system differs from another
one
Possession

location information)
Or

Procedure Start of mission
5.4.1
Introduction
5.4.1.1
The driver may have to start a mission:
a) Once the train is awake, OR
b) Once shunting movements are finished, OR
Once a mission is ended, OR
d) Once a slave engine becomes a leading engine。
5.4.1.2
The common point of all these situations is that the
ERTMSIETCS on-board is in
Stand-By mode
but the Start of Mission will be different; since some data
may be
already stored on-board, depending on the previous situation。
5.4.1.3
Once the ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment is in Stand-By mode, the start of mission
is not the only possibility, the engine may become remote controlled (i.e. the on-board
switches to Sleeping mode):
5.4.2
Status Of data stored in the ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment
5.4.2.1
At the beginning of the Start of Mission procedure; the data required may be in one of
three states:
a) "Valid" (the stored value is known to be correct)
b)
'Invalid" (the stored value may be wrong)
C) "Unknown'
(no stored value available)
5.4.2.2
This
refers
to
the following
data:
Driver ID,
ERTMSIETCS
level,
RBC
IDlphone
number, Train Data, Train Running Number, Train Position (see 3.6.1.3).
5.4.2.3
Note 1:
The status of data in relation to the previous and the actual mode is described
in chapter 4, section "What happens to stored information when entering a mode".
5.4.2.4
Note 2: The change of status of data in course of the procedure is shown in the table
in section 5.4.3.3.

Entryin Shunting with Order from Trackside
5.7.1
General Requirements
5.7.1.1
This procedure is used to allow the entry of a train into a shunting area。
5.7.1.2
Note:
The shunting
area
possibly including
3
"safety envelope",
can
be already
occupied by shunting units, not controlled by the trackside.
It is therefore possible that
the train shall enter into the shunting area in OS mode.
The switch to OS is performed
according to the relevant procedure.
5.7.1.3
The order to switch to SH mode shall be given by means of a mode profile; optionally
with
8 list Of balises groups,
Which the train can pass when the ERTMSIETCS
On
board equipment is in shunting mode.
5.7.1.4
The switch to shunting, i the transition to shunting Was ordered by trackside; requires
a driver
acknowledgement; according to the specifications below。
5.7.1.5
When the ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment has switched to Shunting mode; End of
Mission, according to chapter 5.5.2.3, is performed.
5.7.2
Shunting is requested for the current location (from modes different from
Stand Byand Post Trip)
5.7.2.1
In a level
1area, orat the border from a level 0 to a level
1area, the beginning of the
shunting area can be the location Where a balise group is installed. In level 2/3 it is
possible to send an ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment the order to switch to shunting
at the current location.
5.7.2.2
Shunting is requested for the current location
means that; according to the
mode
profile received the max safe front end of the train is at orin advance of the location for
which switching to SH mode is requested.
5.7.2.3
The ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment shall switch immediately to SH mode and a
request for acknowledgement shall be displayed to the driver (refer to SRS chapter 4,
transitions between modes).
5.7.2.4
If the driver does not acknowledge within the driver acknowledgement time (refer to
Appendix A3.1) after the change to SH
mode;
the service brake command shall be
triggered. The command shall be released as soon as the driver acknowledges (unless
the command Was triggered also for other reasons)
5.7.3
Shunting is requested for a further location
5.7.3.1
An order to switch to SH at a further location can be sent
8) in a level 1area by a balise group,

request for acknowledgement shall be displayed to the driver, when the following two
conditions are fulfilled:
a) the
distance
between
the estimated front end
Of the train
and the beginning of
shunting area is shorter than a Value; contained in the mode profile
b) the speed is lower than the Shunting
mode speed limit (National Value;
Or Value
in the mode profile)
5.7.3.3
Once the request for acknowledgement is displayed, i shall not be taken back, even if
the above conditions are no more fulfilled (e.9., the train accelerates).
5.7.3.4
Until the ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment has switched to SH mode, according to
the mode profile; the beginning of the shunting area shall be considered either as the
EOA (keeping the SvL given by the MA) or as both the EOA and SvL (instead of the
EOA and SvL given by the MA), with no release speed.
5.7.3.5
When
the
driver   acknowledges;

Procedure Override
5.8.1
Introduction
5.8.1.1
In specific degraded situations (for example in the case of a failed signal, failed track
circuit, failed point...), railways allow a train to pass its EOA。
5.8.1.2
For ERTMSIETCS, passing an EOA can be required in degraded situations, e.9.
In level 2/3,xa train is stopped Without MA in a location Where radio is unavailable
(e.9. after having received an emergency message, orafter a train trip).
In level 2/3, xa train is stopped at the border between two adjacent RBCs (e.9. the
interface between RBCs is unavailable).
In level 2/3,
讦
3
train is stopped after having passed the border between two
adjacent RBCs (e.9. the connection to the Accepting RBC cannot be established).
In level 2/3, 讦 the RBC is unable to give a permission to run (e.9. lost connection
With the interlocking)
In level
1 ,
讦
a Signal cannot show
a
proceed aspect (e.9., signal failure,
route
cannot be set)
In level 1, i a train is stopped Without MA (e.9. after the MA has been shortened
due to a time-out):
5.8.1.3
In level OINTC areas, passing
a
signal at danger is only a
national procedure。
The
ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment is not involved in this procedure, since it does not
supervise the train movements.
5.8.1.4
In ERTMS equipped areas (level
1 ,
2
Or 3),
locations where the train shall stop are
supervised by the ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment. Receiving
an order from the
signalman to pass the EOA, the driver must then be able to inhibit this supervision。
5.8.1.4.1
Note: The driver must not use the "Override" procedure unless authorised by trackside
personnel. This authorisation is covered by operational procedures。
5.8.1.5
I
an
EOA
must
be passed
between
announcement and
execution
of
the
level
transition from an unfitted area (level 0) or from an area fitted With a National System
(level NTC) to an ERTMS equipped area (level 1,2,3), the signalman gives the order
to the driver to select "override"
5.8.1.6
Note: Passing the EOA by using this procedure the driver is fully responsible for the
train driving.
Therefore Staff Responsible
mode is entered
When the driver selects
woVerride'=
5.8.1.7
In addition the procedure allows to avoid a train trip When passing a balise group:
a) transmitting "stop in SR mode"
b) not contained in the list of expected balises in SR mode

reaches the beginning of the On Sight area or, at the latest, When the train reaches the
beginning of the On Sight area。
5.9.1.2
An acknowledgement for running in On Sight mode shall be requested from the driver。
The conditions of the acknowledgement are specified below.
5.9.2
On Sight is requested for current location (from modes different from
Stand By and Post Trip)
5.9.2.1
In a level
area, the beginning of the On Sight area can be the balise (group) that
gives the
Mode Profile。
When the train passes the balise group
and receives this
information;
the ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment shall immediately switch to On

5.9.6.1
General rule
5.9.6.1.1
The ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment exits the On Sight mode When the min safe
front end of the train passes the end of the On Sight area.
5.9.6.2
First case: The On Sight area ends at the EOA of the current MA
5.9.6.2.1
This occurs When the end of the On Sight area that is given by the Mode Profile has
the same location as the EOA of the related MA.
5.9.6.2.2
In this case; the train must receive a new Movement Authority to be able to exit the On
Sight area。
5.9.6.2.3
Note: In an On Sight area there is no guarantee for the RBC that the track in front of
the supervised train is free。
Therefore, i the next block section is free, the RBC has
nevertheless to ensure that there is no trainlvehicle between the train and the end of
the On Sight area。
This information
can be given to the RBC by the signalman or any other trackside means (outside
scope of ERTMSIETCS), Or
can be inquired by the RBC by means of the following mechanism: the RBC sends
3
"track
ahead
free"
request
Which
the
ERTMS/
ETCS
on-board
equipment
displays to the driver. If the driver confirms that the track is free up to the end of the

section,
the

Will
transmit
this
information to the RBC.

Change of Train Orientation
5.12.1
Introduction
5.12.1.1
The scope Of this procedure is the supervision Of a train Where the driver controls the
train from the cab in the front of the train with the direction controller in FORWARD
position。
5.12.1.2
This implies that when the driver has to change the orientation of the train, he has to
change the driving cab。
5.12.1.3
The scope of this procedure is NOT shunting
movements, during
Which the driver
changes the running direction of the train Without leaving the cab;
by changing the
position of the direction controller from FORWARD to REVERSE。
5.12.1.4
The scope of this procedure is NOT the backwards movement that is allowed in Post
Trip orin Reversing mode。
5.12.2
The driver uses the same engine (a mission is on-going)
5.12.2.1
The situation is the following: The driver closes the desk A and leaves the cab Aof the
leading engine of the train, to go to cab Band open desk Bof this same engine.
5.12.2.2
Desk Aand desk Bare connected to the same ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment。
5.12.2.3
When
the
driver closes
the
desk
A,
the
ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment shall
immediately go to Stand-By mode; Which is considered as an end of mission (see "End
Of Mission" procedure)
5.12.2.4
When the driver opens the desk B, the "Start of Mission" procedure is triggered.
5.12.2.5
When the driver closes

desk and opens the other one of the same engine;
the
ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment shall be able to calculate the
new train position
data (train front position, train orientation), by use of the previous data。
5.12.3
The driver leaves the engine to go to another one
5.12.3.1
The described situation is the following:
The train has two engines (engine
A
and
engine B. The engine A is the leading engine. The engine Bis a slave engine。
Each
engine has its own ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment。
a) If engine Bis remote controlled, its ETCS on-board equipment is in Sleeping mode。
Note: The mode is entered When on-board equipment detects the presence of the
"remote control" signal。

Definition for splitting: The "train to be split" is the train at standstill, waiting for being
split. The "front train after splitting" refers to the front part of the train before splitting,
the "new train after splitting" , refers to the other
5.14.1.2
Definitions for joining: The "train to be joined" is the train at standstill , waiting for being
joined. The "joining train" is the train performing the joining operation。
5.14.2
Procedure "Splitting"
5.14.2.1
Step
The electrical and mechanical links between the two trains must be removed
(this is a national operational procedure; out of the scope of the SRS)
5.14.2.1.1
Note: If splitting requires moving the two train parts apart from each other for a small
distance, this can be done even in SB mode
5.14.2.2
Step 2a
If the ERTMSIETCS onboard equipment Which
Was supervising the train
before splitting
has
not performed
an
end of
mission for splitting, the
driver
must
modify the Train Data such that it fits with the
new train composition after splitting。
For level 2 or 3, the new train data is sent to the RBC (see SRS chapter 3
Data Entry
Modification Process)
5.14.2.3
Step 2b
If an ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment of the "new train after splitting'
WaS

计
will Switch to SB
mode once the remote control signal is not
received
any
more
(refer

released when the driver
acknowledges, except x brakes are also applied for another
reason(s)
5.19.2.5
Note: Once in Limited Supervision mode, the speed supervision is such that the train
speed
cannot

Components of ERTMSIETCS Language
7.3.1 Introduction
7.3.1.1
The ERTMSIETCS language is used in transmitting information over the radio, balise
and loop airgaps。
7.3.1.2
The ERTMSIETCS language is based on variables, packets, messages and telegrams
(variables and packets are described in this section, While telegrams and messages
are described in chapter 8)
7.3.1.3
Note: A number of variables contain Values which have to be assigned. Some of these
Values have to be unique to ensure that the system functions properly。
A centralised
handling
Of
this
assignment
is
therefore
required
(nationally
Or
internationally;
depending on the variable)。
The variables concerned have been marked。
Values
included in this document for these variables are therefore not to be used without prior
Verification of their Validity. See SUBSET-054 for further details。
7.3.2Definition of Variables
7.3.2.1
Variables shall be
used to encode single data
Values。
Variables cannot be split in
minor units. The Whole variable has one type (meaning).
7.3.2.2
Variables
may
have special values
which
are related to the basic meaning of the
Variable.
7.3.2.3
Special values have always the highest values in a variable (eg. 11..111
"unknown")
7.3.2.4
Spare values shall be located between the normal and special values in the variable
range
7.3.2.5
Names of variables are unique。
A
Variable is used in context With the meaning
35
described in the variable definition. Variables with different meanings have different
names。
7.3.2.6
AIl variable definitions shall be independent of the transport media over Which
are
used, x used in more than one media。
7.3.2.7
Signed values shall be encoded as 2's complement.
7.3.2.8
One bit variables (Boolean) shall always use 0 for false and
for true
7.3.2.9
Offsets for numerical values shall be avoided (0 shall be used for 0,
1
for 1, etc )
except where justified。
7.3.2.10
When transmitting over the different transmission media, the most significant bit shall
be transmitted first。
7.3.2.11
AII Variables have one of the following prefixes:

7.3.3Definition of Packets
7.3.3.1
Packets
are
multiple variables grouped into
3
Single unit,
with
a
defined internal
structure.
7.3.3.2
This structure consists of a packet header with:
Track to
Train:
3
unique packet number;
the length of the packet in bits; the
orientation information;
optionally the distance scale and
an information section
containing a defined set of variables. The packet structure is as follows:
Number
NID_PACKET
Packet identifier
Direction
DIR
Specifies
the   Validity direction
of transmitted data
Length
PACKET
Number of bits in the packet
Scale
SCALE
Specifies Which distance scale
is
Used
for
all
distance
information within the packet。
There is no Q_SCALE variable
in packets which do not contain
distance information.
Information
Well defined set(s) of variables。
Train to Track: a unique packet number, the length of the packet in bits, optionally
the distance scale and an information section containing a defined set of variables。
The packet structure is as follows:
Number
NIDPACKET
Packet identifier
Length
PACKET
Number of bits in the packet
Scale
SCALE
Specifies Which distance scale
is
Used
all
distance
information within the packet。

EEIG ERTMS USERS GROUP
There is no Q_SCALE variable
in packets which do not contain
distance information.
Information
Well defined set(s) of variables。
7.3.3.3
The packet definition does not change When transmitted over different transmission
media。
7.3.3.4
AII currently not defined packet identifiers
are reserved for future
USe
and shall be
considered as invalid values (i.e. like spare Values ). Exception: reception of information
only differing by Y
with regards to the highest system version number X supported by
on-board (refer to section 3.17.3.11). All future packet definitions shall follow the above
defined structure。
7.3.3.5
Exception: Packet 0 "Virtual Balise Cover marker and Packet 255:
End of Telegram'
do not follow the above defined structure。
7.3.3.6
N_ITER specifies the number of iterations of a
Variable
Or group of variables Which
follow。
7.3.3.7
If N_ITERis 0 then no variables follow.
7.3.3.8
Two nested levels of iterations can exist。
7.3.3.9
If, depending on the value of a previous qualifier variable in the packet;
a Variable is
optional, it is written indented in the packet definition
7.3.3.10

Introduction
8.3.1
Scope and Purpose
8.3.1.1
This chapter defines the format and content of messages necessary for ERTMSIETCS
functions。
8.3.1.2
Concerning the transmission media, this chapter does not cover considerations such
as medium-specific Use constraints (e.9. distance between track-circuit and balise.. ),
35
Well
as functions (e.9.
detection of balise reference;
time
and
location stamp,
identifying type of receiving balise;
Management, Releasinglmaintaining a
radio
connection. . . ) and performance of the transmission media。
8.3.2
Definitions
8.3.2.1
Transmission
media
considered
hereafter
are standard
ERTMSIETCS transmission
media used for ETCS (Eurobalise; Euroradio and Euroloop).
8.3.2.2
message includes user data (application level) and protocol data (depending on the
transmission medium).
8.3.2.3
Eurobalise message is the information sent by a balise group (i.e。
the message is
composed of one or several telegrams, sorted by balise number in the group (telegram
from
balise
number
first),
each telegram
js
transmitted
by
a
Eurobalise).
A
Eurobalise telegram
contains
one
header
and
an
identified
and
coherent
Set
Of
Packets_
