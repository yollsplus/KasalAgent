Introduction
1.3.1.1
Train control is an important part of any railway operations management system. In the
past a number of different Automatic Train Control (ATC) systems have evolved in
different
countries
at
different
times。
These   systems
are
incompatible
and
not
interoperable with each other. Only a few of these systems are used in more than one
country, and even in those cases there have been differences in detailed development
which have resulted in incompatible and not interoperable versions。
1.3.1.2
Many railways anticipate
a
significant increase
in
density
Of train
traffic
and
are
rethinking their infrastructure strategy, to accommodate high levels of traffic, in Which
ATC systems play
an important part。
AIsO
many railways
would
like to introduce
standardised systems
to
reduce system
COsts.
In
order
to
establish international
standardisation of ATC systems, the following document specifies the European Rail
Traffic Management SystemlEuropean Train Control System (ERTMSIETCS).
1.4
Advantages of an International Interoperable System
1.4.1.1
The advantages expected by the railways can be summarised as:
Cross border interoperability.
Improvement of the safety of national and international train traffic。
Improvement of international passengers and freight train traffic management。
Shorter headway on heavily trafficked lines; by driving
on moving block; enabling
exploitation of maximum track capacity。
The possibility of step-by-step introduction of the new technology.
Enabling Pan-European competition between the manufacturers of ERTMSIETCS
components. Strengthening the position of the European railway industry on the
World market.
Enabling
preconditions
for
future
harmonisation
in
other
areas
Of
rail
traffic
management。
1.5
About this Document
1.5.1.1
The purpose Of this document is to specify the unified European Train Control System
(ETCS) from a technical
Ofview。
1.5.1.2
Some parts of the system are only specified to allow a migration from existing train
control systems to ETCS (e.9. STMs) over a transition period.
might be removed
in a future edition of the standard.
1.5.1.3
To reach technical interoperability it is necessary not only that telegrams are generated
and
understood according to
Well
specified
rUles
but also that

Due to the nature of the required functions, the ERTMSIETCS system Will have to be
partly on the trackside and partly on board the trains。
2.4.1.2
This defines two subsystems, the on-board subsystem and the trackside subsystem。

The environment of ERTMSIETCS system is composed of:
a
the train, which will then be considered in the train interface specification;
b) the driver, which Will then be considered via the driver interface specification;
c) other onboard interfaces (see architecture drawing in 2.5.3),
d) external
trackside  systems (interlockings,

The balises will be
organised in groups, each balise transmitting a telegram and the
combination of all telegrams defining the message sent by the balise group。

Levels and transitions
2.6.1
Introduction
2.6.1.1
The different ERTMSIETCS application levels (short: levels) are a Way to express the
possible operating relationships between track and train. Level definitions are related
to the trackside equipment used,
to the
Way trackside information reaches the
On-
board units and to Which functions are processed in the trackside and in the on-board
equipment respectively.
2.6.1.2
Different levels have been defined to allow each individual railway administration to
Select
the
appropriate
ERTMSIETCS
application
trackside,
according
to
their
strategies,
to
their
trackside
infrastructure
and
to
the
required
performance。
Furthermore;
the
different  application
levels  permit
the   interfacing
of
individual
signalling systems and train control systems to ERTMSIETCS.
2.6.1.3
For the purpose of a consistent specification a level 0 has been defined. This level is
used for operation on non-equipped (unfitted) lines
Or on lines equipped
With train
control system(s) but operation under their supervision is currently not possible。
2.6.2
Definitions
2.6.2.1
train equipped with ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment always co-operates with the
ERTMSIETCS trackside equipment in a defined ERTMSIETCS level。
2.6.2.2
AIItransitions between levels are performed according to well-specified rules。
2.6.2.3
ERTMSIETCS can be configured to operate in one of the following application levels:
ERTMSIETCS Level 0 (train equipped With ERTMSIETCS operating on a line not
equipped with any train control system (ERTMSIETCS or national system) or on a
line equipped
With
ERTMSIETCS
andlor national system(s) but operation under
their supervision is currently not possible)
ERTMSIETCS
Level NTC (train equipped
with ERTMSIETCS operating
on a line
equipped with a national system)
ERTMSIETCS Application Level
With or without infill transmission (train equipped
with ERTMSIETCS operating
On
3
line equipped with Eurobalises and optionally
Euroloop or Radio infill)
ERTMSIETCS Application Level 2 (train equipped with ERTMSIETCS operating on
3
line
controlled by
3
Radio
Block
Centre
and equipped
with
Eurobalises
and
Euroradio) with train position and train integrity proving performed by the trackside
ERTMSIETCS Application Level 3 (similar to level 2 but with train position and train
integrity supervision based on information received from the train)

It is possible to superimpose several application levels in parallel on the same track, for
example to
rUn
trains  without train integrity
device in
level 2
and in parallel trains
equipped with train integrity device in level 3_
Other examples might be a station Which
is Shared by trains arriving over level
and level 2 lines (junctions) or parallel operation
of a national system with ERTMSIETCS. Mixed levels are supported。

Full train data has to be entered in order not to have to stop a train at a
level transition position and to supervise maximum train speed。
2.6.4.1.9
A combination of national systems can be regarded as one NTC level。
2.6.4.1.10
Depending
on the functionality and the configuration of the specific national system
installed onboard, the ERTMSIETCS Onboard system may need to be interfaced to it,
in order to perform the transitions fromlto the national system andlor in order to give
access to ERTMSIETCS Onboard resources (e.9.
DMI). This can be achieved through
a device called an STM (Specific Transmission Module) using a standardised interface.

2.6.5.1.2
Movement authorities are generated trackside
and
are transmitted to the train
Via
Eurobalises。

lineside
signal clears;
an approaching
train
can
not receive
this
information until it passes the Eurobalise group at that signal. The driver therefore has
to observe the lineside signal to know When to proceed。
The train has then to
be
permitted
to approach
the stopping location
below
a
maximum permitted
release
speed。
2.6.5.1.8
Additional Eurobalises can be placed between distant and main signals to transmit infill
information, the train will receive new information before reaching the signal。
2.6.5.1.9
Note: Lineside signals are required in level
applications, except 讦 semi-continuous
infill is provided。
2.6.5.1.10
Semi-continuous infill can be provided using Euroloop or radio infill. In this case; the
on-board system will be able to show new information to the driver as soon as i is
available and even at standstill.
2.6.5.1.11
Euroloop or radio infill can improve the safety of a level
1
System as they allow the
operation Without release speed。

Introduction
3.3.1
Scope and purpose
3.3.1.1
The chapter 3, Principles; specifies the system principles of ETCSIERTMS。
These
principles apply to on-board and trackside subsystems.
3.3.1.2
The principles define the operational and technical behaviour of the system in general
and functional terms。
3.3.1.3
The
chapter
is
divided
into
subchapters。
In
each
subchapter
normally
Several
requirements
are defined.
Each requirement is identified with
3
unique identification
number。
3.3.1.4
Notes, Justifications and Examples are only informative and shall not be regarded as
requirements:
3.4
Balise configuration and linking
3.4.1
Balise Configurations
Balise Group Definition
3.4.1.1
balise group shall consist of between one and eight balises。
3.4.1.2
In every balise shall at least be stored:
a) The internal number (from
to 8) of the balise
b) The number of balises inside the group
The balise group identity.
3.4.1.3
The internal number of the balise describes the relative position of the balise in the
grOUP.
3.4.2
Balise Co-ordinate System
3.4.2.1.1
Every balise group has its own co-ordinate system。
3.4.2.1.2
The orientation of the co-ordinate system of a balise group (i.e.
nominal Or reverse
direction) is identified as balise group orientation.
3.4.2.2
Balise groups composed of two or more balises
3.4.2.2.1
The origin
of the co-ordinate system for each
balise group is given by the
balise
number
(called location reference) in the balise group.
3.4.2.2.2
The
nominal direction of each balise group is defined by increasing internal balise
numbers.

report based on two balise groups reporting the train position in reference to the LRBG
and the "previous LRBG", ifany。
3.4.2.3.3.1.1
Note: Receiving this type of position report advises the RBC of the need to assign a
co-ordinate system to this single balise group。

Balise Information Types and Usage
3.4.3.1
In
level
1 ,
all information to
the on-board system is given from
balise groups
Or
additionally from
EUROLOOPS
Or
Radio Infill
Units (see section 3.9).
In level 2/3,
balise groups are mostly used for location information。
3.4.3.2
balise may contain directional information, i.e. valid either for nominal or for reverse
direction;
Or
may
contain
information
Valid
for
both
directions.
In
level
1,
this
information can be of the following type (please refer to section 3.8.5):
a) Non-infill
b) Intentionally deleted
Infill.
3.4.3.2.1
Intentionally deleted.
3.4.3.2.2
Note: Infill information is referring to the location reference of an announced
balise
group.

Some information shall be read also in sleeping mode and when no linking information
is
available
(see
Chapter
4

Such
information
is
transmitted by balises, and 讦 the information is directional, balise groups consisting of
at least two balises shall be Used.
3.4.4
Linking
3.4.4.1
Introduction
3.4.4.1.1
Aim of linking:
To determine
Whether
3
balise group has been missed
Or
not found within the
expectation Window (see section 3.4.4.4) and take the appropriate action。
To assign a co-ordinate system to balise groups consisting of a single balise。
To correct the confidence interval due to odometer inaccuracy (see section 3.6.4).
3.4.4.1.2
balise group is linked when its linking information (see section 3.4.4.2) is known in
advance.
3.4.4.1.2.1
Note: In
cases Where a
balise group contains repositioning information, the term
linked also applies since the balise group is announced , marked as linked and contains
repositioning information marked accordingly.
3.4.4.2
Content of linking information
3.4.4.2.1
Linking information shall be composed of:
a) The identity of the linked balise group.
b) Where the location reference of the group has to be found.

3.4.4.4.2.1
When linking information is used on-board and the expected balise group is referred
in the linking information with a balise group with ID
unknown"
a balise group marked
as linked shall only be taken into account f:
a) the on-board equipment can determine the orientation of the linked balise group by
information from
te
balise group itself (therefore excluding
for example single
balise groups), AND
b) the balise group
contains repositioning information valid for the train orientation;
AND
the balise group is crossed with the direction announced in the linking information.
3.4.4.4.3
The on-board equipment shall accept a balise group marked as linked and included in
the linking information (i.e. the balise giving the location reference) from
When the max safe front end of the train has passed the first possible location of
the balise group
Until
the min safe front end of the train has passed the last possible location of the
balise group
taking the offset between the front of the train and the balise antenna into account。
3.4.4.4.3.1
Note: The first possible location and the last possible location of the balise group
are defined by the linking distance and the location accuracy.
3.4.4.4.3.2
Note: The interval between the outer limits to accept the balise group defines the
expectation Window。
3.4.4.4.4
In case of a balise group containing repositioning information , the first possible location
shall start from the previously linked balise group。

3.4.4.4.6
The ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment shall stop expecting a balise group and shall
expect the next one announced in the linking information (讦 any) when:
a) the balise group is found inside its expectation Window
b) a linking consistency error is found, see 3.16.2.3.1
3.4.4.4.6.1

3.6.1.3
The Train Position information defines the position of the train front in relation to a
balise group, Which is called LRBG (the Last Relevant Balise Group). It includes:
The estimated train front end position, defined by the estimated distance between
the LRBG and the front end of the train
The train position confidence interval (see 3.6.4)
Directional train position information in reference to the balise group orientation
(see 3.4.2, also Figure 14) of the LRBG, regarding:
the position of the train front end (nominal or reverse side of the LRBG)
the train orientation
the train running direction

Movement authority
3.8.1
Characteristics ofa MA
3.8.1.1
The following characteristics can be used in a Movement Authority (see Figure 17:
Structure of an MA):
a) The End of Movement Authority is the location to Which the train is authorised to
moVe
b) When
the Target Speed at the
End
Of
Movement Authority is Zero, the
End of
Movement Authority is called EOA (End of Authority); when the target speed is not
Zero, i is called the LOA (Limit of Authority). This non Zero target speed can be time
limited.
I
no overlap exists, the Danger Point is a location beyond the
End of Movement
Authority that
Can
be reached by the front end of the train without
3
risk for
3
hazardous situation.
d) The end of an overlap (if used in the existing interlocking system) is a location
beyond the Danger Point that can be reached by the front end of the train Without a
risk for a
hazardous Situation.
This additional distance is only Valid for a
defined
time.
e) A release speed is a speed limit under Which the train is allowed to run in the vicinity
Of the
End
of Movement Authority, when the target speed is
Zero.
One release
speed can be associated With the Danger Point, and another one with the overlap。
Release speed can also be calculated on-board the train (see section 3.13.9.4).
The MA can be split into several sections, The last one is called End Section.
first time-out value can be attached to each section. This value will be used for
the revocation of the associated route When the train has not entered into it yet. It is
called the Section time-out。
In addition, a second time-out value can be attached to the End Section of the
MA.
This second time-out Will be used for the revocation of the last section when i
is occupied by the train; it is called the End Section time-out。
3.8.1.2
The values of the time-outs possibly given in an
MA shall take into account the time
elapsed from the start of validity of information to the sending of the message.
3.8.1.3
Note: A Danger Point can be (not exhaustive list):
the entry
of an occupied block section (if the line is operated according to
fixed block principles)
the position of the safe rear end of a train (讦 the line is operated according to
moving block principles)

Switch, positioned for a
route; conflicting with the current
direction

train  (both

Of
operation)
3.8.1.4
Note: Traditionally the overlap is a piece of track (beyond the danger point), that is put
at disposal of a train, to guarantee a
non hazardous situation, also in case the driver
should misjudge the stopping distance for the train. In ERTMSIETCS the overlap can
be used to improve the efficiency of the braking supervision。
3.8.1.5
Note: Time-out Values can be given in the MA to cope with the following situations
depending on the interlocking operations;
i.e. the timers on-board will only reflect the
situation trackside and when expired (on-board) the actions taken are restrictive:
a) Section time-out or time-out for the speed at the LOA: When a signalman requests
a route release of a part of a route not yet entered by the approaching train。
b) End Section time-out: When
the train
has entered the last
of
3
route
the
automatic route release can be delayed to make sure that the train has come to a
standstill before any switches inside the route can be moved.
Time-out for an overlap: When the train has entered the last part of a
route, the
overlap associated with the route remains valid for a certain time to make sure that
the train
has successfully stopped before its
End of Movement Authority。
If the
overlap is
still unoccupied
When
the
timer expires the interlocking
revokes the
overlap。
3.8.1.6
Note: If the trackside equipment does not have enough information to give the distance
to the End of Movement Authority with a target speed equal to Zero, a target speed
higher than zero can be given (LOA,
Limit of Authority)。
It is the responsibility of the
trackside to ensure that the safe distance beyond the LOA is long enough to brake the
train from the target speed to a
stand still without any hazardous situation。
It is the
responsibility of the on-board equipment to apply the brakes 讦 no new information is
received when the Limit of Authority is passed.
3.8.2
MA request to the RBC
3.8.2.1
It shall be possible for the on-board equipment to request a
new Movement Authority

3.8.2.2
The parameters for requesting a new MA shall be given by the RBC.
3.8.2.3
In level 2/3, the following possibilities shall be available:
a) A

running at the warning speed (see section 3.13.11 for details):
b) A defined time before the Section timer (not the End Section timer, not the Overlap
timer) for any section of the MA expires, or before the LOA speed timer expires。

3.8.3.7.1
Justification: The balise group is not necessarily placed at the same location as the
Signal and thus an infill message (which includes the same information as the balise
group at the main signal) could change the location of the EOA to a position closer to
the train.

Justification:
in
this
CaSe
the
train
is
already beyond
the

start location;
therefore i is impossible to determine When that location
Was crossed and SO What
share of the time-out value has elapsed since the crossing event. The safe assumption
is to consider that the tme-out value has been exceeded and therefore that the End
Section will soon be released by the Interlocking.

In case an End Section timer is already running when the on-board receives a new MA

Section Time Outs
3.8.4.2.1
The on-board shall start a Section timer for each section:
a) For Level 2: at the Value of the time stamp of the message including the MA.
b) For Level 1: at the time of passage over the first encountered balise of the balise
group giving the MA.
3.8.4.2.1.1
Justification for b): This is to ensure that the timer is always started before or at the
same time
as the related variable information is
received。
ThUs the tmer start is
independent of in Which balise the variable information is given。
3.8.4.2.2
When

Justification for b): This is to ensure that the timer is always started before or at the
same time

Thus the timer start is
independent of in Which balise the variable information is given。
3.8.4.3.2
When the LOA speed timer value becomes greater than the time-out value given by
trackside,
the speed associated With the LOA
shall be set to Zero (i.e。
the Limit of
Authority becomes an End of Authority and the SvL is defined on-board according to
3.8.4.5).
Refer to appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of location based information
stored on-board, Which shall be deleted accordingly。
3.8.4.4
Time-out of Overlap
3.8.4.4.1
The Overlap timer shall be started on-board when the train passes the Overlap timer
start location given
by
trackside
with
its
max
Safe front
end。
The
tmer
shall
be
considered as started even xf a time-out value "infinite" is given。
3.8.4.4.2
When the Overlap timer value becomes greater than
the time-out Value given by
trackside, the following shall apply:
3) the overlap information
Shall
be
deleted
and
the Supervised
Location
Shall
be
determined in accordance with 3.8.4.5.
Refer to appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive
list
of

On-board,
Which
shall
be
deleted
accordingly.
b) the release speed associated With the Overlap shall be deleted
讦 any, a non zero target speed value at the End of Movement Authority shall be set
to zero (i.e.an LOA at the End of Movement Authority becomes an EOA).
3.8.4.4.3
If the train comes to a standstill after the Overlap timer has been started, the on-board
shall consider that the Overlap timer value became greater than its time-out value and
shall apply 3.8.4.4.2.
3.8.4.4.4
In case
no Overlap timer is running When the on-board receives
3
new MA with
an
Overlap timer start location in rear of the max safe front end of the train, the on-board
shall consider that the Overlap timer value became greater than its time-out value and
shall apply 3.8.4.4.2.
3.8.4.4.4.1
Justification:
in this
Case
the
train
is
already beyond

location;
therefore i is impossible to determine when that location
Was crossed and So What
share of the time-out value has elapsed since the crossing event. The safe assumption
is to
consider that the

Value
has been exceeded
and therefore
that the
Overlap will soon be released by the Interlocking.

the value received with the new MA.
3.8.4.4.5.1
Justification: this allows repetition of the
MA
Via RBC (e.9. acknowledgment of
current MA was lost) without unintentionally affecting the Overlap timer。
3.8.4.5
Supervised Location
3.8.4.5.1
The Supervised Location (SvL ) shall be defined on-board as:
a) the end of overlap (if any and before time-out).
b) if not, the Danger Point (if any):
if not, the End Of Authority.
3.8.4.5.2
As long as a Limit of Authority is supervised, no SvL shall be defined on-board.
3.8.4.6
Inffill MA (level

3.8.4.6.1
An MA given by an infill device is called an infill MA。
3.8.4.6.2
An infill MA shall be evaluated on-board only x the on-board equipment is in FS orLS
mode.
3.8.4.6.3
The infill information shall include the identity of the balise group at the next main
signal i.e。
the identity of the balise group giving the information that is transmitted in
advance by the infill device.
3.8.4.6.4
An infill MA shall be evaluated on-board only 讦 the linking information, regarding the
main signal balise group to Which it refers, is available.
3.8.4.6.5
The on-board shall start a Section timer for each section beyond the next main signal:
a) When the infill information is received from a balise group at the time of passing the
first encountered balise of the infill balise group.
b) When the infill information is received from a loop at the time of receiving the loop
message。
When the infill information is received from a radio infill unit at the Value of the time
stamp of the radio infill message including the MA.

Definition of Static Speed Restriction
3.11.2.1
Static Speed Restrictions are imposed by the trackside infrastructure, the train
characteristics, the signalling and the mode of the on-board equipment。
3.11.2.2
There are eleven categories of Static Speed Restrictions:
a) Static Speed Profile (SSP)
b) Axle load Speed Profile (ASP)
C)
Temporary Speed Restrictions (TSR)
d) Maximum Train Speed
e) Signalling related speed restriction (only level 1)
f)
Mode related Speed Restriction.

Static Speed Profile (SSP)
3.11.3.1.1
The Static Speed Profile (SSP) is a description of the fixed speed restrictions of a
given piece of track. The speed restrictions can be related to e.9. maximum line speed,
curves, points, tunnel profiles, bridges。
3.11.3.1.2
The Static Speed Profile is based on factors, which are both track and train dependent。
The relationship
between
track
and
train
Characteristics
determines
the individual
Static Speed Profile for each train。
3.11.3.1.3
It shall be possible for every element (distance between two discontinuities) of a static
speed profile to define;
讦
a transition to

It shall be possible to transmit several Static Speed Profile Categories; one Basic SSP
category and specific SSP categories related to the international train categories。

Speed and distance monitoring
3.13.1
Introduction
3.13.1.1
The speed and distance monitoring is the supervision of the speed of the train versus
its position,
in
order to
assure that the
train remains
within the given speed and
distance limits.
3.13.1.1.1
Note: The speed and distance monitoring of the on-board can only assure this When
the following necessary conditions are fulfilled:
Brake system of the train functions as specified
wheellrail adhesion is sufficient for the required safe deceleration
Brake characteristics (and other Train related inputs) are correctly entered into the
on-board
3.13.1.2
Note: The ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment triggers brake commands and revokes
them; i
also receive status information 讦 the brakes
are
applied
Or released.
However, it cannot be made responsible i brake control circuits outside the equipment
fail. Also the way the brakes are released by the driver after a revocation of a brake
command is an implementation issue。
3.13.1.3

Conversion Models
3.13.3.1
Introduction
3.13.3.1.1
For trains with variable composition (loco hauled trains), the brake characteristics can
Vary together with the composition of the train. In this case, i is not convenient to pre-
program the brake parameters necessary to calculate the braking curves。
The only
practical way to obtain the correct values for the current train composition is to include
them into the data entry process by the driver. However, i cannot be expected from
the driver to know deceleration values and brake build up tmes。
Conversion models
are
therefore
defined
to
convert
the
parameters
entered
by
the
driver
(brake
percentage and brake position) into the parameters of the corresponding brake model。
3.13.3.1.2
Note: The process for defining the input parameters for the conversion model (brake
percentage
and
brake
position)
is
outside
the
SCODe
Of
the
ERTMSIETCS
specifications。

Note: The overspeed above the maximum train speed Which may occur due to the

For trains not fitting into at least one of those Validity limits, it is still possible to acquire
the brake percentage

Train length compensation
3.13.4.2.1
Assuming that a fictive train front end would be at any location between the current
(actual) train front end location and the SvL , the acceleration due to the gradient shall
be determined using the lowest (taking the sign into account) gradient value given by
the gradient profile between the location of the fictive train front end and the location of
the fictive train rear end (see Figure 35)
3.13.4.3
Rotating mass
3.13.4.3.1
The influence of gradients shall be compensated for the rotating mass of the train (see
Figure 35)
3.13.4.3.1.1
Note: Since the rotating mass works like a flywheel (rotating inertia), the effect of
the gradient is reduced. Assume for instance a (theoretical) train without any rotating
masS,

On
a downhill
gradient from height

AII the energy
added to the train When it goes from H1 to H2 is converted into linear forward motion
This can be observed as an acceleration due to the gradient。
Now assume the same
train With
Of the weight rotating. If this train travels the same distance from H1 to
H2, the same amount of energy is added to the train. But now a part of that energy is
converted into rotational motion and only the remaining part is converted into linear
forward motion.
The latter can be observed as an acceleration which is less than for
the train without rotating mass。
3.13.4.3.1.2
Note: For the influence of the rotating mass on the deceleration due to the brake;

3.13.9.3.5.7.1 Note: the re-Use of the same distance travelled and speed increase between the
Permitted speed supervision limit and the EBD, as for the estimated speed (see Figure
49), leads to an overestimationlunderestimation of the Permitted speed to be displayed
to the driver. This simplification, which avoids the need of an iterated calculation; is
however acceptable and necessary since the error made tends to zero when the train

To avoid Very low values When Tbs is small, a minimum is defined for T_indication,

Release speed supervision limits
3.13.9.4.1
The release speed is a special ceiling speed limit, applicable in the vicinity of the EOA。
The
EBI supervision limit is equal to the release speed。
There is
no
SBl,
W, 尸 |
supervision limit associated to the release
3.13.9.4.2
Note: The release speed may be necessary for two reasons. One is that a train has to
be able to approach the EOA
where the permitted speed reaches zero and might be
too restrictive to permit acceptable driving due to inaccuracy of the measured distance。
The other reason is that in a level
application the train has to be able to overpass the
balise when the signal clears。
For these two reasons a (Iow) release speed may be
given from trackside or may be calculated on board, based on the distance from the
EOA to the Supervised Location.
3.13.9.4.3
With each MA, it shall be possible for the trackside to:
a) Give the value of the release speed directly to the on-board, OR
b) Instruct the on-board to calculate the release speed, OR
Instruct the on-board to Use the national value。
3.13.9.4.4
In case the MA does not identify the variant to be used orin case of LOA,
no release
speed shall be supervised。

Requirements for Target speed monitoring
3.13.10.4.1In target speed monitoring, both the ceiling supervision limits and the braking to target
supervision limits, described in sections 3.13.9.2 and 3.13.9.3,
are Used to determine
the commands to the Train Interface and the supervision statuses displayed to the
driver。
3.13.10.4.2The on-board equipment shall display to the driver the target information (target speed
and distance to target) related to one target at a time: the Most Relevant Displayed
Target (MRDT)。
The MRDT shall be selected amongst the supervised targets Whose
Indication supervision limit is exceeded (i.e。
a condition to trigger a supervision status
with respect to these targets is met, see table 8 and table 9) and shall be determined
according to the following steps:
Step

MRDTo
the target
of
Which
the braking

Permitted  speed
supervision limit (refer to section 3.13.9.3.5), calculated for the current position of
the train, is the lowest one amongst the concerned targets:

Step 1: the on-board equipment shall check whether the MRDT obtained from the
previous step (MRDTo) masks any other target(s) remaining in the list of concerned
targets, Whose target speed is lower than MRDT。:

It shall be
identified using one of the following formulas,
Where both the Indication supervision

are calculated
using the

board equipment shall 90 to the next step。
If none of the remaining targets from the list of concerned targets is masked by
MRDTo or xf there is no other remaining target to check in the list of concerned
targets,
then the
MRDT shall be the target obtained from the previous step (i.e。
MRDTO)

circumstances (especially When several targets are close to each other) i is avoided
that a target is displayed after its Indication supervision limit has been reached.

It is possible to operate a train using more than one engine, each engine being under
the control of a driver。
3.15.2.2
Only the leading engine is responsible for the train movement supervision functions。
3.15.3
Splittingljoining
3.15.3.1
ERTMSIETCS
allows Splitting
and Joining
using
the
normal supervision functions
available (e.9. On-sight, Shunting):
3.15.3.2
Splitting only
refers to the
case that the two resulting trains contain
at least
one
ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment each。
3.15.3.2.1
Note: This must be ensured by operational procedures。
3.15.3.3
ERTMSIETCS
is
not responsible for
providing information
that
3
SplittinglJoining
operation has been correctly completed (technical aspect andlor operational aspect):
3.15.3.4
Justification: ERTMSIETCS is not able to provide this information. Splitting and Joining
requires the fulfilment of operating rules ensuring that a SplittinglJoining operation has
been correctly completed (e.9. physical disconnection):
3.15.4
Reversing of movement direction
3.15.4.1
It shall be possible to send in advance to an on-board equipment information about
areas, Where initiation of reversing of movement direction is possible;
i.e. change the
direction of train movement without changing the train orientation。
3.15.4.1.1
A
new reversing area given from the trackside shall replace the one already available
on-board.
3.15.4.2
Together with start and end of reversing area,
the following supervision information
shall be sent:
a) Maximum distance to run in the direction opposite to the orientation of the reversing
area, the fixed reference location being the end location of the area Where reversing
of movement is permitted with Which the maximum distance information is sent
b) Reversing mode speed limit allowed during reverse movement。

Determination of the operated system version
3.17.2.1
The on-board equipment shall be able to operate With (i.e。
shall support) any of the
ERTMSIETCS system version numbers X included in the envelope of legally operated
system versions, as defined in chapter 6.
3.17.2.1.1
Within one of its supported system version numbers X, the on-board equipment shall
always operate the highest system version number Y
defined in this release of te
SRS, regardless of the system Version number Y transmitted by the trackside.
3.17.2.2
The on-board equipment shall operate with only one system version at a time; ie。
计
Shall behave according to the whole set of requirements applicable to a system version
(refer to chapter 6
in
case the operated system version is older than the last one
introduced in this release of the SRS).
3.17.2.3
The on-board equipment shall determine the operated system version number X,in
relation
to
non-RBC
trackside
constituents;
35
the
System
Version
number
X
transmitted by any balise;
Or RIU, 讦 this system version number Xis higher than
the currently operated one。
3.17.2.4
It shall be possible from balise group to order the on-board equipment to operate a
system version。
3.17.2.5
On receiving the order to operate system version from
balise group, the on-board
equipment shall immediately operate the system version number X given in the order。
After the order is executed, the requirement 3.17.2.3 shall be again applied for any
further received balise telegramlloop message or any further contacted RIU.

Handling of Actions in Specific Situations
A.3.5.1
Regards actions executed in reference to location information received from trackside;
the on-board equipment shall ensure that the action related to a location is neither
reverted,
nor
executed
twice
Situations
to
be
considered
shall
include
reVerse
movement (initiated
by
driver
Or
due
to roll-away)
and
the
sub-sequent forward
movement;
or adjustment of train position on passing
3
new LRBG.
This rule shall
apply to the following actions:
Change of National Values (see 3.18.2)
Request to acknowledge new level , level transition (see SRS chapter 5.10)
Start and stop displaying plain or fixed text messages (see 3.12.3)
Request to acknowledge a mode profile; mode transition due to mode profile (see
3.12.4)
Start and stop accepting radio infill information (see 3.9.3)
Actions related to RBC/RBC handover (see 3.15.1)
Actions related to track condition information (see 3.12.1) with the exception of big
metal masses and non stopping areas
Permission to initiate Reversing mode;ie.
limits of Reversing Area (see 3.15.4)
Start and stop Track Ahead free request to driver (see 3.15.5)
Start and stop calculation of geographical position (see 3.6.6)
Substitute the supervision of the LX start location as the EOAISVL by the inclusion
of the LX speed restriction in the MRSP (see 5.16.2 and 5.16.3)
A.3.5.2
Once the ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment has received
3
balise group message
(i.e. once it has received the last balise telegram of the balise group), the action(s)
resulting from its content shall take into account the train position measured at the time
of reception of this last telegram and shall take precedence on any other action related
to a further location that is reached before the message has been fully processed.
A.3.5.2.1
Example 1: in level 1, the crossing of the EOALOA location with the min safe antenna;
before

Was in rear of the

Standard case
A.3.6.1.1
When the train moves in the direction of its train orientation, storage capacity occupied
by trackside information
no longer used,
ie
the related on-board functionality has
been completed, shall be made available immediately。

value in rear of the min safe rear end position of the train:
location dependent static speed restrictions
ie., SSP, ASP, TSR, LX SR, PBD SR

avoid any false alarms due to Big metal masses in the track。
A.3.6.2.1.2 Note: The distance to intervention of the roll away or reverse movement supervision is
determined by a NationallDefault value。
This is also true for a reverse movement in
Post trip mode. However, following an intervention, the train Will not stop immediately。
In order to keep the on-board functionality simple;
a fixed distance Value was chosen
to define an unambiguous location in rear of the train Where the above information is

It also
makes it possible to release the brakes before a speed reduction, Without having the

moving back again. It might though result in emergency brake intervention if the
driver releases the brakes too early。

this is not a

train frontlrearend.
4.4.6.1.5
Sleeping mode shall be automatically detected on-board via the train interface。
4.4.6.1.6
If possible;
the train must not be stopped due to a safety critical fault in a sleeping
engine。
The ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment should therefore try to memorise the
occurrence Of such fault(s)
Which should
be handled
When the engine leaves the
Sleeping mode。
The ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment should also try to send
an
error information to the RBC.

REVERSING
4.4.18.1
Description
4.4.18.1.1
The Reversing mode allows the driver to change the direction of movement of the train
and drive from the same cab,
ie。
the train orientation remains unchanged. This is
possible only in areas so marked by trackside。
4.4.18.1.2
Note: This mode is used to allow the train to escape from a dangerous situation and to
reach as fast as possible a "safer" location。
4.4.18.1.3
The ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment shall supervise train movements against:
a) a ceiling speed: the Reversing mode speed limit given from trackside
b)a
distance
to
rUn
in
the
direction  opposite to
the
train orientation, given from
trackside. The emergency brake shall be commanded xf overpassing this distance
4.4.18.1.4
After the
release of
3
brake
command  initiated
due
to
an overpassed reversing
distance, and While the reversing distance is still overpassed, the ERTMSIETCS
On
board equipment shall command the emergency brake for any further movement in the
direction opposite to the train orientation.
4.4.18.1.5
The ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment shall display the train speed, the permitted
speed and the remaining distance to run。
4.4.18.1.6
In
case the SBI supervision limit is exceeded (refer to chapter 3
table 5, triggering
condition t4), the ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment shall command the emergency
brake instead of the service brake。
For the revocation of the brake command, refer to
3.13.10.2.4.
4.4.18.1.7
The position reports sent when in reversing
mode shall refer to the location of the
driving cab (as before reversing).
4.4.18.1.8
Note:
The
ERTMSIETCS
onboard
equipment  performs
the
ReVerse
Movement
Protection (as in RV mode; the "normally allowed movement" is backwards, then the
Reverse Movement Protection avoids the train running in forward direction when in RV
mode)
This implies that the given distance to
run in reversing is considered

means: The condition n^4 must be fulfilled to trigger the transition
4.6.1.2
From the mode located in the column
4.6.1.3
To the mode that is indicated by the arrow " >
4.6.1.4
Each transition from a given mode receives a priority order (indicated by
 pX
Xis the
priority order) to avoid a conflict between the different transitions when they occur at
the same time (i.e.in the same clock cycle). P1 has a higher priority than P2。
4.6.1.5
Some transitions have received the same priority order. This has been decided when it
is obvious that these transitions cannot occur at the same time, and So can never lead
to a conflicting situation (for example; the RBC cannot give in the same time a MA for
FS and a MA for OS to a given engine; this is Why the transition "from SR to FS" and
the transition "from SR to OS" have the same priority order).
4.6.1.6
"16,17,18" means "16 or 17 or 18".

DMI depending on modes
4.7.1
Introduction
4.7.1.1
The DMI is an interface that allows the direct exchange of information between the
driver and the ERTMSIETCS onboard equipment. The indirect exchange of information
done via the train interface (e.9.
a drivers action
on the service brake used for the
service brake feedback, openinglclosing the desk) is not part of the DMI.
4.7.1.2
The device(s) used to select
'ERTMSIETCS onboard equipment poweredlunpowered"
is (are) not part of the DMl.
4.7.1.3
The device(s) used to selectlindicate "ERTMSIETCS onboard equipment isolatedlnot
isolated" is (are) part of the DM.
4.7.1.4
Intentionally deleted.
4.7.1.5
Information (input or output) only relevant for National System and not originated by
the ERTMSIETCS on-board is not included in the following section。
4.7.2
DMI Versus Mode Table
4.7.2.1.1
X = active: For a DMI output, this means that the output information shall be shown to
the driver When the ERTMSIETCS onboard equipment is in the mode indicated in the
column.
For a DMI input, this means that it shall be possible for the driver to enter this
information when the ERTMSIETCS onboard equipment is in the mode indicated in the
column).
4.7.2.1.2
A
available: This means that the inputloutput shall become active ONLY if another
condition(s) is (are) fulfilled. This condition(s) are not described here。
4.7.2.1.3
Grey cells: availability and meaning defined by national system。
4.7.2.1.4
NA
Not Applicable: This concerns the modes SF and IS in Which the DMI inputs and
outputs cannot be determined。

Acceptance of received information
4.8.1
Introduction
4.8.1.1
The aim of this chapter is to give an overview Of Which information is accepted or
rejected depending on the state of the on-board (level, mode) and the nature of the
received information (transmission medium, type of information: infill or non-infill):
4.8.1.2
The following sections have to be interpreted by applying the filters as shown in Figure
3
The first filter is detailed in section 4.8.3
Accepted information depending on the
level and transmission media",
the third filter in section 4.8.4
Accepted information
depending on the modes"
4.8.1.3
I
3
message
contains
level
transition information,
any
other information
in
that
message shall be evaluated considering the level transition information.
4.8.1.3.1
Information received in the same message as an immediate level transition order or a
conditional level transition order that causes a level transition shall be evaluated first
considering
the on-board currently operated level,
35
讦
3
level transition
order for
further location had been received (i.e. conditions [1],[2] or [6] of Figure 3, x applied,
Shall be automatically fulfilled). Then, 讦 relevant, it shall be immediately extracted from
the buffer and re-evaluated according to the new selected level。
4.8.1.4
Note:
As
Shown
in Figure
3,
information stored following
an announcement
Of
a
change of level,
is re-checked for acceptance
when
the level
has changed.
This
implies that;
When
the
level changes;
the
mode
js
for
3
Short
moment
Still
unchanged, until the stored information has been processed. The consequence for the
Third Filter is that information needs to be accepted for this short period also in modes
in Which this information is otherwise useless。
4.8.1.5
I
3
message contains infill information, this latter shall be evaluated considering all
other non-infill information in that message.
4.8.1.6
When evaluating trackside information received by radio or when re-evaluating a set of
information
released from
the transition buffer; linking information;
讦
any,
Shall be
evaluated prior to any other location related information.

4.8.2
Assumptions
4.8.2.1
The following tables shall be applied assuming that:
a) the information complies with the system Version checks (see section 3.17.3) and
with the data consistency checks. (see section 3.16)
b) the direction for which the information is valid matches the current train orientation,
or the balise group crossing direction (for SL, PS and SH engines) (see section
3.6.3)
C) In
levels
2/3,
+
is assumed
that
the
"RBC"
information
Which
is
marked
"A
(Accepted) comes from
the supervising
RBC (see
RBCIRBC handover):
忏
this
information is received from the "Accepting'
RBC While the "Handing Over" RBC is
still  responsible;
计
is

and
Acknowledgement

shall
be
immediately
accepted。
Exceptign
2:
The
information "Co-operative shortening
Of
MA'
"Revocation
of
Emergency Stop" and
'LSSMA display toggle onloff order" shall be rejected.
to check exception [4] in 4.8.3, the track description is referred to the LRBG (i.e。
relocation has been performed see 3.6.4.3)
the information from balise is received
While
no reVerse
movement is performed
(see clause 3.14.3.6)
4.8.2.2
Regarding 4.8.2.1
a:
In
Case
3
balise is
missed
Or
3
balise telegram
cannot
be
decoded, the information
'Inhibition of balise group message consistency reaction" is
only used by the on-board equipment to inhibit the service brake reaction, While the
balise group message is rejected. If all the telegrams from a balise group are correctly
read,
the information
'Inhibition
Of
balise group
message consistency reaction",
讦
received, shall be ignored by the on-board equipment. Therefore this information need
not to be referred to in the following tables。
4.8.2.3
In case a balise telegram contains the information VBC marker and a countrylregion
identity that both match a stored VBC, the whole balise telegram is ignored and any
further check in
relation
to this balise telegram is irrelevant (refer to 3.15.9.3 b)。
Otherwise
the
information
VBC
marker,
讦
included
in
a
consistent
balise
group
message, shall always be ignored by the ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment and need
not to be referred to in the following tables。
4.8.2.4
Note: With the exception of the data that is forwarded to a National System through the
STM interface (see 3.15.6 and SUBSET-035), What will happen to the data to be used
by applications outside ERTMSIETCS (e.9.
Whether i is discarded, forwarded to
an
external application, processed by a national function.. ) is outside the scope Of this
specification
and
is assumed
35
not being part
Of
te
ERTMSIETCS
on-board
functionality.

Handling of transition buffer in case of level transition announcement or
RBCIRBC handover
4.8.5.1
Ifan order to switch to level NTC, 1,2 or 3 at a further location has been received, the
ERTMSIETCS onboard equipment shall be able to store in
a transition buffer (see
figure 3, first filter) three sets of information obtained from three filtered messages。
4.8.5.2
I
a
RBC transition order has been received and the Handing Over RBC is still the
supervising
one; the ERTMSIETCS
onboard equipment shall be able to store in
3
transition buffer (see figure 3,
second filter) three sets of information obtained from
three filtered messages from the Accepting RBC.
4.8.5.2.1
Note: the term "set of information" refers to the part of a message being stored in the
transition buffer (i.e. information which is neither accepted
nor rejected immediately)
according
tO
the
conditions
Stated
in
4.8.3.1
[1]
and
[2] (for
level transition)
Or
according to 4.8.2.1c (for RBCIRBC handover).
4.8.5.3
In case three sets of information are already stored in the transition buffer, any new set
to be stored shall replace the oldest one currently stored。
4.8.5.4
The sets of information stored in the transition buffer shall be deleted:
a) in case the level transition order is deleted or overwritten by another level transition
order for a different level, OR
b) in case the RBC transition order is deleted or overwritten by an order to switch to
another Accepting RBC,OR
in
Case
the
communication
session
with
the
RBC
that  provided
the
stored
information is terminated
4.8.5.5
At the same time the level transition is performed or at the same time the Accepting
RBC
becomes the supervising
one;
the sets of information stored in the transition
buffer shall be released and re-evaluated in the sequence
have been received.
4.8.5.6
This sequential re-evaluation of all the released information shall be a prerequisite to
any use by the on-board equipment (e.9.
i Will lead neither to an intermediate change
Of mode
nor to
3
change of information displayed to the driver) and shall obey the
following principles:
a) Starting
from
the
information
currently
used
by
on-board
at the
moment
the
IevellRBC
transition
is
effective;
the
ERTMSIETCS
on-board
equipment
Shall
determine
the
neW
information
for
train  supervision;
by performing sequential
updates from the information released from the transition buffer, if accepted.
b) For each information update related to a re-evaluated set of information, the same
rules
shall apply
35
to information update related
to
new information accepted
outside a IeVellRBC transition context。

The information resulting from
this sequential update shall then be used by the
ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment
4.8.5.7
Accepting re-evaluated Conditional Emergency Stop information according to table
4.8.3 implies
that
the accepted
Conditional Emergency Stop information may
be
accepted
or rejected in a further step (see clause 3.10.2.2) depending
on the
given
stop location.
This decision,
based on the comparison between the min safe front end
position of the train at the time the message was received and the given stop location,
shall be considered part of the evaluation process as it affects the further re-evaluation
of information stored in the transition buffer (see clause 3.10.2.4)
4.8.5.7.1
Note:
For the case of the Unconditional Emergency Stop information accepting the
information according to table 4.8.3 Will always lead to the train being tripped (see
clause 3.10.2.3) When re-evaluation of the transition buffer is completed. Information
accepted during re-evaluation of information stored in the transition buffer can then be
affected on transition to TR mode according to conditions in Table 4.10.
4.8.5.8
Note: The requirement to acknowledge an Emergency Stop information according to
clause 3.10.1.4,i.e., communicating to the RBC if the information has been accepted
(Conditional or Unconditional Emergency Stop) or rejected because the train has
passed the stop location (Conditional Emergency Stop only), applies to the time When
the information is used, immediately after the sequential update has been completed。
Regards acknowledging the reception of an emergency stop message; as for any
other information received from trackside, see clause 3.16.3.5.

Introduction
5.3.1
Scope and Purpose
5.3.1.1
This document defines the procedures that are necessary for interoperability Within the
scope Of ERTMSIETCS。
5.3.1.2
Each procedure is defined by a set of mandatory requirements and, Where convenient;
is illustrated by a flowchart。
5.3.1.3
In case the condition(s) in chapter 4 triggering a
mode transition is(are) fulfilled, this
transition shall be executed even if not shown in the chapter 5 procedures。
5.3.1.3.1
Note: Such a mode transition could lead to exiting a procedure immediately (e.9. cut
Off power of on-board equipment, isolation of on-board equipment).
5.3.1.4
National operation rules (outside of ERTMSIETCS) are
also excluded, but may
be
applied by the railways in addition to the procedures
as long
as interoperability is
retained.
5.3.2
Definitions
5.3.2.1
Procedures
procedure defines the required reaction of the ERTMSIETCS entities (subsystems
and components) to either information exchanged between ERTMSIETCS entities or
events (triggered by external entities or internal events)
The procedures focus on the
required change in status and mode of the described ERTMSIETCS entities。
5.3.2.2
Entities
The procedures define the required system behaviour
On
a
context level;
.
8
the
entities
that
are
used
to
define
the procedures
are
for
example:
the
on-board
equipment, the trackside equipment (RBCIBalise), the driver。
5.3.2.3
States
States are situations of an ETCS subsystem with a specific set Of available functions
and
a
specific set of events that
start or terminate the state.
A
state remains
active as long as the conditions to trigger the transition to a succeeding state are not
completely satisfied。
Note 1: one mode of operation may include several states for the on-board equipment
Note 2: A new state is only created, 讦 the behaviour of the system differs from another
one
Possession
of information (e。

location information)
Or

Procedure Start of mission
5.4.1
Introduction
5.4.1.1
The driver may have to start a mission:
a) Once the train is awake,
OR
b) Once shunting movements are finished, OR
Once a mission is ended, OR
d) Once a slave engine becomes a leading engine。
5.4.1.2
The common point of all these situations is that the
ERTMSIETCS on-board is in
Stand-By mode
but the Start of Mission will be different; since some data
may be
already stored on-board, depending on the previous situation。
5.4.1.3
Once the ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment is in Stand-By mode, the start of mission
is not the only possibility, the engine may become remote controlled (i.e. the on-board
switches to Sleeping mode)
5.4.2
Status Of data stored in the ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment
5.4.2.1
At the beginning of the Start of Mission procedure; the data required may be in one of
three states:
a) "valid" (the stored value is known to be correct)
b)
'Invalid" (the stored value may be wrong)
C) "Unknown'
(no stored value available)
5.4.2.2
This
refers
to
the following
data:
Driver ID,
ERTMSIETCS level,
RBC
IDlphone
number, Train Data, Train Running Number, Train Position (see 3.6.1.3).
5.4.2.3
Note 1:
The status of data in relation to the previous and the actual mode is described
in chapter 4, section "What happens to stored information when entering a mode"
5.4.2.4
Note 2: The change of status of data in course of the procedure is shown in the table
in section 5.4.3.3.

Entryin Shunting with Order from Trackside
5.7.1
General Requirements
5.7.1.1
This procedure is used to allow the entry of a train into a shunting area。
5.7.1.2
Note:
The shunting
area
possibly including
a
"safety envelope"
Can
be already
occupied by shunting units, not controlled by the trackside. It is therefore possible that
the train shall enter into the shunting area in OS mode.
The switch to OS is performed
according to the relevant procedure.
5.7.1.3
The order to switch to SH mode shall be given by means of a mode profile; optionally
with
8 list Of balises groups,
Which the train can pass when the ERTMSIETCS
On
board equipment is in shunting mode.
5.7.1.4
The switch to shunting, 讦 the transition to shunting Was ordered by trackside; requires
a driver
acknowledgement; according to the specifications below。
5.7.1.5
When the ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment has switched to Shunting mode; End of
Mission, according to chapter 5.5.2.3, is performed.
5.7.2
Shunting is requested for the current location (from modes different from
Stand Byand Post Trip)
5.7.2.1
In a level
1area, orat the border from a level 0 to a level
1area, the beginning of the
shunting area can be the location Where a balise group is installed. In level 2/3 it is
possible to send an ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment the order to switch to shunting
at the current location.
5.7.2.2
Shunting is requested for the current location
means that; according to the
mode
profile received the max safe front end of the train is at orin advance of the location for
which switching to SH mode is requested.
5.7.2.3
The ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment shall switch immediately to SH mode and a
request for acknowledgement shall be displayed to the driver (refer to SRS chapter 4
transitions between modes).
5.7.2.4
If the driver does not acknowledge within the driver acknowledgement time (refer to
Appendix A.3.1) after the change to SH mode; the service brake command shall be
triggered. The command shall be released as soon as the driver acknowledges (unless
the command Was triggered also for other reasons)
5.7.3
Shunting is requested for a further location
5.7.3.1
An order to switch to SH at a further location can be sent
a) in a level
1
area by a balise group,

request for acknowledgement shall be displayed to the driver, when the following two
conditions are fulfilled:
a) the
distance
between
the estimated front end
Of the train
and the beginning of
shunting area is shorter than a Value; contained in the mode profile
b) the speed is lower than the Shunting
mode speed limit (National Value;
Or Value
in the mode profile)
5.7.3.3
Once the request for acknowledgement is displayed, i shall not be taken back, even if
the above conditions are no more fulfilled (e.9., the train accelerates).
5.7.3.4
Until the ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment has switched to SH mode, the beginning
of the shunting area shall be considered as the EOA (instead of the EOALOA derived
from the
and the SvL (with no release speed) shall be determined according to the
mode profile either:
a) as the SvL derived from the MA.In case the MA defines an LOA, the SvL shall be
derived as if no LOA had been given。
OR
b) as the beginning of the shunting area.
5.7.3.5
When
the
driver
acknowledges;
the
ERTMSIETCS
on-board
equipment
Shall
immediately switch to SH mode (refer to chapter 4, transitions between modes)
5.7.3.6
If the
max Safe front end
of the train reaches the beginning of the shunting area
according
te
mode
profile
and
the
driver
has
not
acknowledged,
te
ERTMSIETCS
on-board
equipment
shall
switch immediately
to

mode
and
3
request for acknowledgement shall be displayed to the driver (refer to SRS chapter 4
transitions between modes).
5.7.3.7
If,in this case; the driver does not acknowledge within the driver acknowledgement
time (refer to
Appendix
A.3.1)
after
the change to
SH
mode;
the
service
brake
command shall be triggered. The command shall be released as soon as the driver
acknowledges (unless the command was triggered also for other reasons).
5.7.4
Shunting from Stand By or Post Trip mode
5.7.4.1
When performing a SoMor a Train Trip procedure and when the current level is 2 or 3
the ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment can receive a mode profile giving an Shunting
area Which the train has already entered with its max safe front end. In this case, the
ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment shall first require
an acknowledgement from the

inhibit this supervision。
5.8.1.4.1
Note: The driver must not use the "Override" procedure unless authorised by trackside
personnel. This authorisation is covered by operational procedures。

If a signal at danger must be passed between announcement and execution of the
level transition from
an Unfitted

an area fitted with a
National
System (level NTC) to an ERTMS equipped area (level 1,2,3), the signalman gives
the order to the driver to select "override"
5.8.1.6
Note:
By using this procedure the
driver is fully responsible for the
train driving.
Therefore Staff Responsible mode is entered when the driver selects "override".

First case: The On Sight area ends at the EOALOA of the current MA
5.9.6.2.1
This occurs when the end of the On Sight area that is given by the Mode Profile has
the same location as the EOAILOA of the related MA.
5.9.6.2.2
In this case, the train must receive a new Movement Authority to be able to exit the On
Sight area。
5.9.6.2.3
Note: In an On Sight area there is no guarantee for the RBC that the track in front of
the supervised train is free。
Therefore, 讦 the next block section is free;
the RBC has
nevertheless to ensure that there is no trainlvehicle between the train and the end of
the On Sight area. This information
can be given to the RBC by the signalman or any other trackside means (outside

Change of Train Orientation
5.12.1
Introduction
5.12.1.1
The scope Of this procedure is the supervision Of a train Where the driver controls the
train from the cab in the front of the train with the direction controller in FORWARD
position。
5.12.1.2
This implies that when the driver has to change the orientation of the train, he has to
change the driving cab。
5.12.1.3
The scope of this procedure is NOT shunting
movements, during
Which the driver
changes the running direction of the train Without leaving the cab;
by changing the
position of the direction controller from FORWARD to REVERSE。
5.12.1.4
The scope of this procedure is NOT the backwards movement that is allowed in Post
Trip orin Reversing mode。
5.12.2
The driver uses the same engine (a mission is ongoing)
5.12.2.1
The situation is the following: The driver closes the desk A and leaves the cab A of the
leading engine of the train, to go to cab Band open desk Bof this same engine。
5.12.2.2
Desk Aand desk Bare connected to the same ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment。
5.12.2.3
When
the
driver
Closes
the
desk
A
te
ERTMSIETCS
on-board
equipment
immediately goes to Stand-By mode; which is considered as an end of mission (see
"End of Mission" procedure).
5.12.2.4
When the driver opens the desk B, the "Start of Mission" procedure is triggered。
5.12.2.5
When the driver closes
3
desk and opens the other one of the same engine;
the
ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment shall be able to calculate the
new train position
data (train front position, train orientation), by use of the previous data。
5.12.3
The driver leaves the engine to go to another one
5.12.3.1
The described situation is the following:
The train has two engines (engine
A
and
engine B). The engine Ais the leading engine. The engine Bis a slave engine。
Each
engine has its own ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment。
a) If engine Bis remote controlled, its ETCS on-board equipment is in Sleeping mode。
Note: The mode is entered When on-board equipment detects the presence of the
"remote control" signal。

If the engine Bis not remote controlled (Tandem Shunting operation) by the leading
engine and there is no driver who controls the engine; then the on-board equipment
is in Passive Shunting mode。
5.12.3.2
Assumption: The train configuration does not change.
a) When changing the train orientation,
the leading engine

Definitions
5.14.1.1
Definition for splitting: The "train to be split" is the train at standstill, waiting for being
split. The "front train after splitting" refers to the front part of the train before splitting,
the "new train after splitting" , refers to the other
5.14.1.2
Definitions for joining: The "train to be joined" is the train at standstill , waiting for being
joined. The "joining train" is the train performing the joining operation。
5.14.2
Procedure "Splitting"
5.14.2.1
Step
The electrical and mechanical links between the two trains must be removed
(this is a national operational procedure; out of the scope of the SRS)
5.14.2.1.1
Note: If splitting requires moving the two train parts apart from each other for a small
distance, this can be done even in SB mode
5.14.2.2
Step 2a
If the ERTMSIETCS onboard equipment Which
Was supervising the train
before splitting
has
not performed
an
end of
mission
for splitting, the
driver
must
modify the Train Data such that it fits with the
new train composition after splitting。
For level 2 or 3, the new train data is sent to the RBC (see SRS chapter 3
Data Entry
Modification Process)
5.14.2.3
Step 2b
If an ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment of the "new train after splitting'
WaS

For Level 2
Or
3:
The ERTMSIETCS
on-board equipment opens
3
communication
session (if possible) and reports the mode change to the RBC。
5.14.2.4
Step 2c
If an ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment of the "new train after splitting'
WaS
in NL mode before; i Will switch to SB mode once the non leading input signal is not
received any more (refer to SRS chapter 4, transitions between modes and chapter 5
"end of mission" procedure)
5.14.2.5
The driver can then start a new mission With this "new train after splitting" (refer to the
"Start Of Mission'
procedure). In all cases, to start a mission is not the only possibility。
Shunting movements, or not moving the new train at all, are also possible。
5.14.3
Procedure "Joining"
5.14.3.1
Step
1
The
"joining train"
must approach
the

7.3
Components Of ERTMSIETCS Language
7.3.1
Introduction
7.3.1.1
The ERTMSIETCS language is used in transmitting information over the radio, balise
and loop airgaps。
7.3.1.2
The ERTMSIETCS language is based on variables, packets, messages and telegrams
(variables and packets are described in this section, while telegrams and messages
are described in chapter 8)
7.3.1.3
Note: A number of variables contain values Which have to be assigned. Some of these
Values have to be unique to ensure that the system functions properly。
A centralised
handling
Of
this
assignment
is
therefore
required
(nationally
Or
internationally;
depending on the variable)。
The variables concerned have been marked. The values
included in this document for these variables are therefore not to be used without prior
Verification of their Validity. See SUBSET-054 for further details。
7.3.2
Definition of Variables
7.3.2.1
Variables
are used to encode single data Values。
Variables cannot be split in minor
Units.
The Whole variable has one type (meaning).
7.3.2.2
Variables
may
have special values
Which
are related to the basic meaning of the
Variable.
7.3.2.3
Special values have always the highest values in a variable (e.9.32767
runknown" )
7.3.2.4
Spare values are located between the normal and special values in the variable range
7.3.2.5
Names of variables are unique。
A
Variable is used in context with the meaning
35
described in the variable definition. Variables with different meanings have different
names。
7.3.2.6
All variable definitions
are independent of the transport media
over Which they are
Used, 讦 used in more than one media。
7.3.2.7
Signed values shall be encoded as 2's complement。
7.3.2.8
One bit variables (Boolean) always use 0 for false and
for true。
7.3.2.9
Offsets for numerical values are avoided (0 is used for 0,
1 for 1, etc ) except Where
justified.
7.3.2.10
When transmitting over the different transmission media, the most significant bit shall
be transmitted first。
7.3.2.11
AII Variables have one of the following prefixes:

Definition of Packets
7.3.3.1
Packets
are
multiple variables grouped into
3
Single
unit,
with
3
defined
internal
structure.
7.3.3.2
This structure consists of a packet header with:
Track to
Train:
3
unique packet number,
the length
Of the packet in
bits, the
orientation information;
optionally the distance scale and
an information section
containing a defined set of variables. The packet structure is as follows:
Number
NID_PACKET
Packet identifier
Direction
DIR
Specifies
the   Vvalidity direction
of transmitted data
Length
PACKET
Number of bits in the packet
Scale
SCALE
Specifies Which distance scale
is
Used
for
all
distance
information within the packet。
There is no Q_SCALE variable
in packets which do not contain
distance information.
Information
Well defined set(s) of variables。
Train to Track: a unique packet number, the length of the packet in bits, optionally
the distance scale and an information section containing a defined set of variables。
The packet structure is as follows:
Number
NIDPACKET
Packet identifier
Length
PACKET
Number of bits in the packet
Scale
SCALE
Specifies Which distance scale
is
Used
all
distance
information within the packet。

UNISIG
EEIG ERTMS USERS GROUP
There is no Q_SCALE variable
in packets which do not contain
distance information.
Information
Well defined set(s) of variables。
7.3.3.3
The packet definition does not change When transmitted over different transmission
media。
7.3.3.4
AII currently not defined packet identifiers
are reserved for future
USe
and shall be
considered
as invalid values (i.e。
like spare Values) when received by the on-board
equipment. Exception: reception of information only differing by Y with regards to the
highest system version number X supported by on-board (refer to section 3.17.3.11.
7.3.3.5
Exception: Packet 0 "Virtual Balise Cover marker and Packet 255: "End of Telegram"
do not follow the above defined structure。
7.3.3.6
N_ITER specifies the number of iterations of a
Variable or group of variables Which
follow。
7.3.3.7
If N_ITERis 0 then no variables follow.
7.3.3.8
Two nested levels of iterations can exist。
7.3.3.9
If, depending on the value of a previous qualifier variable in the packet, a variable is
optional, i is written indented in the packet definition
7.3.3.10
Row "Transmitted by'
in the description
Of a
packet specifies Which ERTMSIETCS
trackside device (balise; loop, RlU, RBC) can transmit this packet. "Any' means that
the packet can be transmitted by a balise; a loop, an RBC and a RIU。
7.3.3.10.1
Row "Transmitted to" in the description of a packet specifies to Which ERTMSIETCS
trackside device the packet can be transmitted.

Introduction
8.3.1
Scope and Purpose
8.3.1.1
This chapter defines the format and content of messages necessary for ERTMSIETCS
functions。
8.3.1.2
Concerning the transmission media, this chapter does not cover considerations such
as medium-specific Use constraints (e.9. distance between track-circuit and balise. ),
35
Well
as functions (e.9.
detection of balise reference;
time
and
location stamp;
identifying type of receiving balise;
Management, Releasinglmaintaining a
radio
connection. . . ) and performance of the transmission media。
8.3.2
Definitions
8.3.2.1
Transmission
media
considered hereafter
are standard
ERTMSIETCS transmission
media used for ETCS (Eurobalise; Euroradio and Euroloop).
8.3.2.2
message includes user data (application level) and protocol data (depending on the
transmission medium).
8.3.2.3
Eurobalise message is the information sent by a balise group (i.e。
the message is
composed of one or several telegrams, sorted by balise number in the group (telegram
from
balise
number
first),
each telegram
js
transmitted
by
a
Eurobalise).
A
Eurobalise telegram
contains
one
header
and
an
identified
and
coherent
set of

Introduction
9.3.1
Scope and Purpose
9.3.1.1
Chapter 9 lists a classification into categories of all the clauses in the chapters
to 8 of
the SRS.
9.3.1.2
The
purpose
of this chapter is to
ease the
assessment of the compliance of
an
ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment with the SRS。
9.3.1.3
To
that
effect,
this
chapter
comprehensively
identifies
Which
clauses
contain
requirements
allocated
to
the
ERTMSIETCS
on-board
equipment
and
conversely
which
ones
do
not,
either
because they
contain  requirements
allocated
to
the
ERTMSIETCS trackside only or because
are of another type。
9.3.2
Definitions
9.3.2.1
The following categories are used to classify each SRS clause:
3
ERIMSIETCS
Onboard
requirement:
3
Clause
containing requirement(s)
that
must be fulfilled by a SRS compliant ERTMSIETCS on-board
b) ERIMSIETCS
trackside
requirement:
3
Clause
containing requirement(s)
that
must
be
fulfilled
by
a
SRS
compliant
ERTMSIETCS
trackside,
in
CaSe
the
corresponding function is implemented
Definition: a clause that is a necessary prerequisite to the correct interpretation of
requirement(s)
Or
Without
Which
requirement(s)
cannot
be
unambiguously
interpreted
Iormative: a clause that helps the reader to better understand the context or the
justification of requirement(s)
Others: a clause that does not belong to any of the above categories
9.3.2.2
Throughout the SRS, the requirements are identified as sentences using the keyword
"shall
However:
a) In section 9.4, tables are identified as a single entity through a reference based on
the accompanying
ClaUse
number. They can
be classified
35
ERTMSIETCS
On
board andlor trackside requirements even 讦 they do not include the keyword "shall".
b) Elements of the ERTMSIETCS language (radio messages; packets and variables;
see chapters
7and 8)are also described with tables。
The numbered titles (i.e. the
name of the element preceded by a clause number) together with their associated
table are considered as single entities and are classified as both ERTMSIETCS on-
board and trackside requirements, even 讦
do not include the keyword "shall
either。
9.3.2.3
Amongst the categories listed in 9.3.2.1 only the two first ones can be combined,in
Case
3
requirement equally applies to both ERTMSIETCS on-board equipment and
ERTMSIETCS trackside
or in case tWo unambiguously distinguishable on-board and
trackside requirements
are  kept together
in
the
concerned
clause
for readability
