Abstract:  Performance and functional requirements for a communications-based train control 
(CBTC) system are established in this standard. A CBTC system is a continuous, automatic train 
control system utilizing high-resolution train location determination, independent of track circuits; 
continuous, high-capacity, bidirectional train-to-wayside data communications; and train-borne and 
wayside processors capable of implementing automatic train protection (ATP) functions, as well 
as optional automatic train operation (ATO) and automatic train supervision (ATS) functions. In 
addition to CBTC functional requirements, this standard also defines headway criteria, system 
safety criteria, and system availability criteria for a CBTC system. This standard is applicable to the 
full range of transit applications including automated people movers. This standard establishes a 
set of performance and functional requirements necessary for enhancing performance, availability, 
operations, and train protection using a CBTC System.

Copyright © 2025 IEEE. All rights reserved.Introduction
This introduction is not part of IEEE  Std 1474.1-2025, IEEE Standard for Communications-Based Train Control 
(CBTC) Performance and Functional Requirements.
This introduction provides some background on the rationale used to develop this standard. This information 
is meant to aid in the understanding, usage, and applicability of this standard.
Conventional signaling/train control systems rely almost exclusively on track circuits to detect the presence of 
trains. Information on the status of the track ahead is provided to train operators either through wayside signals 
or train-borne cab signals. Ensuring compliance with the signals is achieved through operating procedures, 
wayside automatic train stops, or train-borne supervisory equipment linked to the train’s braking system. 
These conventional systems are effective in providing train protection, but are not particularly efficient 
in maximizing the utilization of the rail transit infrastructure, as a result of a few fundamental limitations, 
specifically, the following:
a) The location of trains can only be determined to the resolution of the track circuits; if any part of a 
track circuit is occupied by a train, the whole track circuit shall be assumed to be occupied by the 
train. Track circuits can be made shorter, but each additional track circuit requires additional wayside 
hardware, so there is an economical and practical limit to the number of track circuits that can be 
provided.
b) The information that can be provided to a train is limited to a small number of wayside signal aspects 
or a small number of speed codes in a cab signal system.
c) For a wayside signal system with automatic train stops but without continuous cab signaling, 
enforcement is intermittent.
Communications-based train control (CBTC) systems overcome these fundamental limitations of conventional 
track circuit-based systems, and therefore, permit more effective utilization of the transit infrastructure. This 
is accomplished, for example, by allowing trains to operate safely at much closer headways, by permitting 
greater flexibility and greater precision in train control, and by providing continuous safe train separation 
assurance and overspeed protection. Additional benefits of CBTC technology include the economical 
support of automatic train operations (both on the mainline and in maintenance yards), improved reliability, 
and reductions in maintenance costs through a reduction in wayside equipment and real-time diagnostic 
information. The basic characteristics of a CBTC system include the following:
— Determination of train location, to a high degree of precision, independent of track circuits.
— A geographically continuous train-to-wayside and wayside-to-train data communications network 
to permit the transfer of significantly more control and status information than is possible with 
conventional systems.
— Wayside and train-borne vital processors to process the train status and control data and provide 
continuous automatic train protection (ATP). Automatic train operation (ATO) and automatic train 
supervision (ATS) functions can also be provided, as required by the particular application.
There are currently no independent standards defining the performance and functional requirements to be 
satisfied by CBTC systems. This standard enhances performance, availability, operations, and train protection, 
and facilitates design, development, deployment and commissioning of new CBTC applications.
This standard provides standards for Communications Based Train Control functionality. It provides a 
consistent approach for design and development of these transit control systems. This revision allows for 
driverless train operation, including automatic people movers.
As technology changes and evolves the architecture and functionality, and subsequently the standards, of 
Communications-Based Train Control require modification. This revision provides the vehicle to modify 
CBTC standards to comply with changing needs in function and safety.

This standard establishes performance and functional requirements for a communications-based train control 
(CBTC) system. It is divided into six clauses. Clause  1 describes the scope and purpose of this standard. 
Clause  2 lists references that are useful in applying this standard. Clause  3 provides definitions that are 
either not found in other standards or have been modified for use with this standard. Clause  4 defines the 
general operating requirements for CBTC systems, including train operating modes to be supported. Clause  5 
defines the performance requirements for CBTC systems, including headway criteria, system safety criteria, 
and system availability criteria. Clause  6 defines the functional requirements for CBTC systems, including 
automatic train protection (ATP) functions, automatic train operation (ATO) functions, and automatic train 
supervision (ATS) functions.

4.1 Characteristics of CBTC systems
The primary characteristics of a CBTC system include the following:
a) High-resolution train location determination, independent of track circuits
b) Continuous, high capacity, bidirectional train-to-wayside low-latency data communications
c) Train-borne and wayside processors performing vital functions
4.2 Categorization of CBTC systems
This standard recognizes that different configurations of CBTC systems are possible, depending on the 
specific application. For example, a CBTC system may provide the following:
a) Automatic train protection (ATP) functions only, with no automatic train operation (ATO) or automatic 
train supervision (ATS) functions
b) ATP functions, as well as certain ATO and/or ATS functions, as required to satisfy the operational 
needs of the specific application
A typical functional block diagram for a CBTC system is given in Annex  B.
4.3 Train Configurations
A CBTC system shall be capable of supporting a variety of train configurations, including the following:
a) Fixed-length unidirectional trains comprised of one or more basic operating units
b) Fixed-length bidirectional trains comprised of one or more basic operating units
c) Variable-length unidirectional trains
d) Variable-length bidirectional trains
A CBTC system shall be capable of supporting a mixed fleet of trains, where specific trains, and/or classes of 
trains, have different performance characteristics.
4.4 Train operating modes
CBTC-equipped trains may be operated by either a single person or a multi-person crew. A CBTC system may 
also be required to support operation of trains without crews.
For operation of trains with crews, the train operator will typically be stationed in the lead car of the train and 
will be responsible for moving the train from station to station. With a multi-person crew, the conductor(s) will 
normally operate from conductor position(s) within the train to operate the train’s doors. A CBTC system shall 
support single-person train operation by combining the conductor and train operator display information on 
the train operator’s display. For multi-person crews, conductor display information shall also be provided on 
separate conductor displays.
For the purposes of this standard, operation of trains without crews includes both unattended and driverless 
train operations. With unattended train operations, there would normally be no crew member onboard the 
train. With driverless train operations, there may be a crew member onboard the train, but normally not in the 
driving cab. This crew member, if present, would normally have no responsibility for operation of the train 
except for failure recovery.

IEEE Standard for Communications-Based Train Control (CBTC) Performance and Functional Requirements
18
Copyright © 2025 IEEE. All rights reserved.CBTC-equipped trains (including CBTC-equipped maintenance vehicles) shall be capable of operating in 
various modes, depending on whether the train is operating in CBTC territory or non-CBTC territory, and 
depending on the operational status of the train-borne and/or wayside CBTC equipment.
Mixed-mode operation shall also be considered a normal operating mode, to the extent specified by the 
authority having jurisdiction. Mixed-mode operation is defined as the simultaneous operation within CBTC 
territory of CBTC-equipped trains and trains that are not equipped with functional train-borne CBTC 
equipment (including maintenance vehicles). Mixed-mode operation may be used in one or more of the 
following ways:
a) A regularly scheduled mode of operation within CBTC territory
b) An infrequent, unscheduled mode of operation within CBTC territory
c) During the transition period only, as a new CBTC system is cut-in
d) As a result of train-borne CBTC equipment failures
4.4.1  Normal train operating modes in CBTC territory
4.4.1.1  CBTC-equipped trains
CBTC-equipped trains operating in CBTC territory shall operate, within ATP limits, under the protection of 
the CBTC system. The train shall be capable of being controlled manually by a train operator or automatically 
by the CBTC system (supervised by the train operator, if present), as specified by the authority having 
jurisdiction. When operating automatically, some functions (such as door operation and train departure 
initiation) may continue to be the responsibility of the train operator and/or conductor(s), if present.
4.4.1.2  Non-CBTC-equipped trains
Trains not equipped with train-borne CBTC equipment and/or trains with inoperative train-borne CBTC 
equipment that are operating in CBTC territory shall operate under the protection of the CBTC system using 
secondary train detection, or a supplementary systems and/or operating procedures, as specified by the 
authority having jurisdiction.
4.4.2  Failure mode train operations in CBTC territory
For light rail, heavy rail, monorail and commuter rail applications operating with crews, it is an operational 
requirement to continue to move trains safely in the event of CBTC equipment and/or data communication 
failures, possibly at reduced operating speeds and/or increased operating headways when compared to normal 
train operations. Consequently, a CBTC system shall be designed to support degraded modes of operation 
in the event of failure and to continue to provide ATP with minimum reliance on adherence to operating 
procedures as specified by authority having jurisdiction.
For fully automated applications operating without crews, the extent to which the CBTC system shall be 
designed to support degraded modes of operation in the event of failure shall be as defined by the authority 
having jurisdiction, and may include an ability to remotely reset train-borne equipment and the ability to 
support automatic push/pull train recovery, as well as the ability to support manual train operations and 
alternative routing strategies.
For all applications, a fallback plan, based on failure analysis and operating procedures, shall identify train 
operating modes that will take advantage of the degraded modes of operation and recovery capabilities of the 
CBTC system. The goal of the plan shall be to eliminate hazards to passengers and staff in accordance with 
5.3, while continuing to provide passenger service.

Copyright © 2025 IEEE. All rights reserved.Specifically, failure mode train operations in CBTC territory shall address those CBTC system failures 
affecting the following:
a) All trains operating within a particular area of control
b) A particular train operating within any area of control
4.4.2.1  CBTC system failures affecting all trains operating within a particular area of control
In the event of a CBTC system failure that affects all CBTC-equipped trains operating within a particular area 
of control within CBTC territory (e.g., wayside CBTC equipment or wayside-to-train data communications 
failure), trains shall have the capability to provide continued safe operations under the control of an operator, 
and the following:
a) With the protection of a supplementary system (if specified by the authority having jurisdiction); or
b) With the train speed limited by the propulsion system; or
c) Through strict adherence to operating procedures (as defined by authority having jurisdiction); or
d) A combination of any or all of items a), b), and c).
When operating in this failure mode, ATP functions that reside within individual train-borne CBTC equipment 
shall continue to function to the extent safety can be assured.
4.4.2.2  CBTC system failures affecting a particular train operating within any area of control
In the event of a CBTC system failure affecting a particular CBTC-equipped train operating within any area 
of control within CBTC territory (e.g., train-borne CBTC equipment failure), that train shall be capable of 
continued safe operations under the control of an operator, and the following:
a) With the protection of a supplementary system (if specified by the authority having jurisdiction); or
b) With the train speed limited by the propulsion system; or
c) Through strict adherence to operating procedures; or
d) A combination of any or all of items a), b), and c).
When operating in this failure mode, ATP functions that reside within wayside CBTC equipment and within 
other train-borne CBTC equipment shall continue to function to the extent safety can be assured.
4.4.3  Normal train operating modes in non-CBTC territory
CBTC equipment installed on trains operating in non-CBTC territory shall include the necessary capabilities 
to support transitions into CBTC territory. In addition, if specified by the authority having jurisdiction, train 
borne CBTC equipment may also perform other ATP functions while operating in non-CBTC territory, such as 
limiting train speed and/or providing zero speed detection.
If specified by the authority having jurisdiction, train-borne CBTC equipment operating in non-CBTC territory 
may also interface with wayside equipment that is not fully compatible with the train-borne CBTC equipment. 
In no case, however, shall the train-borne CBTC equipment provide an indication of standard CBTC operation 
when operating in non-CBTC territory, unless the applicable authority or authorities having jurisdiction 
over the train-borne and wayside equipment have ensured that standard CBTC operation is supported by the 
integrated train-borne and wayside systems.

Copyright © 2025 IEEE. All rights reserved.4.4.4  Failure mode train operations in non-CBTC territory
Except where specified to perform certain ATP functions while operating in non-CBTC territory, failure of the 
train-borne CBTC equipment shall have minimal impact on train operation. The failure shall be indicated to 
the train operator, if present.
4.5 Entering/exiting CBTC territory
4.5.1  Entering into CBTC territory
A CBTC system shall have precise knowledge of the limits of CBTC territory and shall include the capability 
to perform verification checks of the train-borne CBTC equipment prior to entering CBTC territory. The 
checks shall be performed sufficiently in advance of entry into CBTC territory to verify the proper operation 
of the train-borne CBTC equipment (including any wayside CBTC equipment dependencies).
If the verification check is passed, an indication to this effect shall be provided. Under normal circumstances 
and subject to ATP constraints, it shall not be necessary for a train to come to a stop when entering CBTC 
territory unless required for other operational reasons.
In the event that the verification check fails, an indication of the CBTC system failure shall be provided, and 
the train shall be capable of continued safe operations under the control of an operator, and
a) With the protection of a supplementary system (if specified by the authority having jurisdiction); or
b) With the train speed limited by the propulsion system; or
c) Through strict adherence to operating procedures (as defined by authority having jurisdiction); or
d) A combination of any or all of items a), b), and c).
The results of the verification checks shall be displayed on the ATS user interface. For trains operating with 
crews, the results of the verification checks shall also be indicated to the train operator.
4.5.2  Exiting from CBTC territory
For trains operating with crews, prior to exiting CBTC territory, a CBTC system may provide a visual 
indication to the train operator of time and/or distance until the train will be exiting the CBTC territory. When 
known by the CBTC system, the train operator may also receive an indication of the type of train control 
system into which the train will be traversing.
NOTE— Indications to the train operator may not be required if the transition between CBTC territory and non-CBTC 
territory is operationally transparent to the train operator. Under normal circumstances and subject to ATP constraints, it 
is not necessary for a train to come to a stop when exiting CBTC territory unless required for other operational reasons.
4.6 Train operating speeds
A CBTC system shall be capable of meeting the performance and functional requirements of this standard, 
over the full range of possible train operating speeds specified by the authority having jurisdiction.

Copyright © 2025 IEEE. All rights reserved.5. Performance requirements
5.1 CBTC factors contributing to achievable headways
The required design and operating headways (i.e., the minimum and scheduled headways) for both normal 
and reverse directions shall be specified by the authority having jurisdiction. Headway may be specified as 
uninterfered and/or interfered.
In all cases, the design headway shall be constrained by the safe train separation requirements and the safe 
braking model of 6.1.2.1 .
In the case of an uninterfered headway, a train speed profile shall not be affected by a preceding train. All 
trains shall, therefore, perform at the maximum allowed speed, depending on the civil speed limits and the 
acceleration and braking capabilities of the trains themselves. Operation at uninterfered headways facilitates a 
minimum end-to-end trip time for a given set of station dwell times.
Headways may be reduced (at the expense of increased trip times) with an interfered headway where a train 
speed profile is affected by a preceding train such that a following train decelerates on the approach to a station 
and enters the station area at a reduced speed. Interfered headway may also be specified to support multiple 
berthings at a station platform.
The design headway for a particular line and a particular set of vehicles involves many factors that are out- 
side the control of the CBTC system (e.g., track alignment, gradients, civil speed limits, train acceleration and 
braking rates, station dwell times, terminal track configurations, driver reaction times). These factors shall be 
specified by the authority having jurisdiction. These standard addresses only those CBTC factors contributing 
to achievable headways, of which the most significant are the following:
a) Location (both accuracy of measured end-of-train locations and resolution of movement authority 
limits for a given train), including the frequency at which location reports and movement authorities 
are updated.
b) Speed, including both accuracy of speed measurement and resolution of speed limits established for a 
given train at a given location.
c) Communications delays, including nominal and worst-case transmission times of command/status 
messages between wayside and train, and vice versa. (Command/status messages include, for 
example, messages related to movement authority updates and/or location report updates.)
d) CBTC equipment reaction times, including maximum error accumulation, for both wayside and train-
borne equipment, and for various operating modes, as applicable. (CBTC equipment reaction times 
include, for example, the time required to establish new movement authority limits following location 
report updates, the time to establish new movement authority limits through an interlocking, and the 
time to determine a new ATP profile following movement authority update.)
e) CBTC system performance limitations (e.g., the maximum number of trains that can be processed by 
the CBTC system, within a given area of control).
f) CBTC automatic speed regulation algorithm.
Typical values for the CBTC parameters in items a) through e) are given in Annex  C.
5.2 CBTC factors contributing to achievable trip times
Trip time requirements shall be specified by the authority having jurisdiction, consistent with train performance 
and track alignment characteristics.

22
Copyright © 2025 IEEE. All rights reserved.The minimum end-to-end trip times for a defined set of station dwell times results from uninterfered headway 
speed profiles. The CBTC factors contributing to achievable headways, as identified in 5.1, are also factors 
contributing to the minimum achievable trip times.
5.3 System safety requirements
5.3.1  CBTC System Safety Program requirements
A System Safety Program shall be instituted during the CBTC system planning/design phase and shall 
continue throughout the system life cycle. The CBTC System Safety Program shall emphasize the prevention 
of accidents by identifying and resolving hazards in a systematic manner. A CBTC System Safety Program 
Plan (SSPP) shall be developed for each CBTC application. The CBTC SSPP, as a minimum, shall be prepared 
in accordance with the requirements of E.1 of Annex  E.
Implementation of the CBTC SSPP shall specifically recognize configuration management issues, given the 
importance of software and hardware configuration control in maintaining system safety.
5.3.2  CBTC hazard identification and risk assessment process
Hazard analyses shall be employed during the design of a CBTC system to assist in the identification and 
evaluation of potential hazards to assess their likelihood and severity and to document their resolution. As a 
minimum, a preliminary hazard analysis (PHA) shall be conducted for each new CBTC system project. Other 
detailed analyses, including system/subsystem hazard analyses, failure modes, effects and criticality analyses, 
fault tree analyses, and operational and support hazard analyses, shall also be conducted if man- dated by 
the CBTC SSPP. These analyses shall be conducted in accordance with E.2, E.3, E.4, and E.5 of Annex  E or 
equivalent requirements, as approved by the authority having jurisdiction.
All hazards identified through the CBTC System Safety Program shall be assessed in terms of the severity or 
consequence of the hazard and the probability of occurrence. This shall be accomplished in general accordance 
with the criteria outlined in E.6 of Annex  E or the equivalent, as approved by the authority having jurisdiction. 
Risk assessment estimates shall be used as the basis in the decision-making process to determine whether 
individual system or subsystem hazards shall be eliminated, mitigated, or accepted. This process shall include 
full documentation of the hazard resolution activities.
Hazards shall be resolved through a design process that emphasizes the elimination of the hazard. The 
effectiveness of the hazard resolution strategies and countermeasures shall be monitored to determine that no 
new hazards are introduced. In addition, whenever substantive changes are made to the system, analyses shall 
be conducted to identify and resolve any new hazards.
As a minimum, a CBTC system shall address the following critical/catastrophic system hazards through the 
implementation of the ATP functions defined in 6.1:
a) Train-to-train collisions (rear-end, sideswipe, head-on); hazard to be addressed through train 
separation assurance (see 6.1.2 ), rollback protection (see 6.1.4 ), parted train protection (see 6.1.6 ), 
route interlocking protection (see 6.1.11 ), and travel direction reversal interlocks (see 6.1.12 )
b) Train-to-structure collisions; hazard to be addressed through end-of-track protection (see 6.1.5 ) and 
restricted route protection (see 6.1.16 )
c) Train derailments; hazard to be addressed through overspeed protection (see 6.1.3 ), route interlocking 
protection (see 6.1.11 ), and (where specified by the authority having jurisdiction) broken rail detection 
(see 6.1.14 )

23
Copyright © 2025 IEEE. All rights reserved.d) Collisions between trains and highway vehicles (where highway crossing at grade exists within the 
limits of CBTC territory); hazard to be addressed through grade-crossing warning devices that may 
include interfaces to the CBTC system (see 6.1.15 )
e) Hazards to work crews and work trains; hazards to be addressed through CBTC work zone protection 
functions (see 6.1.13 )
f) Hazards to passengers associated with train movement with train doors open; hazards to be addressed 
through interface between the CBTC system and the train door system (where required by the authority 
having jurisdiction) to provide door opening control protection interlocks (see 6.1.8 ), zero speed 
detection (see 6.1.7 ), platform interlocks (see 6.1.9 ) and where applicable, hazards to passengers 
associated with train movement with platform edge doors open.
g) Hazards associated with collisions with objects on the track; hazards to be addressed through interfaces 
between the CBTC system and restricted route protections (where specified by the authority having 
jurisdiction) (see 6.1.16 )
5.3.3  CBTC vital functions
To eliminate or control to a level acceptable to the authority having jurisdiction those hazards judged to be 
unacceptable or undesirable through the risk assessment process of 5.3.2 , a CBTC system shall include, as a 
minimum, the vital functions identified in 6.1.
All vital functions of a CBTC system shall be designed and implemented in accordance with fail-safe 
principles. Documentation of the means used, and proof that fail-safe principles have been met and the mean 
time between hazardous event (MTBHE) requirements of 5.3.4  have been satisfied, shall be required for every 
CBTC system.
Verification that the processor-based portions of a CBTC system meet these minimum system safety 
requirements shall be completed in accordance with IEEE  Std 1483-2000.12
5.3.4  Quantitative CBTC safety performance requirements
For any CBTC system application, the CBTC wayside and train-borne equipment located within any 
contiguous portion of a one-way route that can be traversed by a train traveling at the specified maximum 
authorized speed for one hour or less shall have a total calculated aggregate MTBHE (total of all critical and 
catastrophic hazards) of at least 109 operating hours. This includes the maximum number of other trains that 
can be located in this contiguous portion of a one-way route under the specified peak operating headway. 
System safety documentation shall support these calculations and substantiate the methodology used to arrive 
at the result. For the purposes of MTBHE calculations, a hazardous event shall include, as a minimum, the 
occurrence of any of the specific hazards identified in 5.3.2 .
NOTE— If the end-to-end trip time for a given route is greater than 1  h, the MTBHE requirement for that route would be 
adjusted proportionately. As an illustrative example, if the specified end-to-end trip time (per 5.2) for a given one-way 
route is 2 h, and if the route includes 4 sets of wayside CBTC equipment, and if a maximum of 10 trains can be operating 
on the route at a given time (when operating at the specified peak headway, per 5.1), then the MTBHE of the combined 
4 sets of wayside CBTC equipment and 10 sets of train-borne CBTC equipment on that route would be at least 0.5 × 109 
operating hours.

All conditions necessary for the existence of any permissive state or action shall be verified to be present 
before the permissive state or action is initiated by a CBTC system. The requisite conditions shall be verified 
to be continuously present for the permissive state or action to be maintained.

NOTE— The AREMA Communications and Signals Manual, Part 17.3.3 [B1]13, provides examples of credible hardware 
failures.

Hazard analyses shall consider all credible CBTC hardware failure modes. Justification shall be provided 
for conceivable failure modes that are not considered credible. Each credible CBTC failure mode shall be 
classified as a combination of either self-revealing or non-self-revealing, and the effect shall be considered as 
follows:
a) No credible single point CBTC hardware failure, whether self-revealing or non-self-revealing, shall 
cause an unsafe condition.
b) No credible CBTC hardware failure in combination with one or more non-self-revealing failure shall 
cause an unsafe condition. In the instance of a non-self-revealing failure, a subsequent failure shall not 
be considered independent.
c) The probability of a critical or catastrophic hazard arising as a result of combinations of simultaneous 
independent self-revealing failures shall be considered in the calculated CBTC MTBHE.

CBTC systems and equipment in order to meet or exceed the on-time performance and fleet availability

addressing CBTC equipment failures, a distinction shall be made between the following failure types:
a) Type 1: Those failures, or combination of failures, that impact on-time performance of the transit 
system.
b) Type 2: Those failures, or combination of failures, that do not impact on-time performance of the 
transit system, but do result in some other loss of specified CBTC functionality.
c) Type 3: Those failures that do not impact on-time performance of the transit system or result in a loss 
of any specified CBTC functionality (e.g., because of equipment redundancy).
The CBTC system availability requirement (see 5.4.2 ) shall include consideration of all Type 1 failures, as 
well as the mean time to restore service (MTTRS) for Type 1 failures.
The CBTC system mean time between functional failure (MTBFF) requirement (see 5.4.3 ) shall include 
consideration of all Type 1 and Type 2 failures.
The CBTC system mean time between failure (MTBF) requirement (see 5.4.3 ) shall include consideration of 
all Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3 failures.
While system availability, system MTBFF, and system MTBF predictions traditionally consider only hard- 
ware failures, measurements of achieved system availability, system MTBFF, and system MTBF shall also 
consider software errors (i.e., software fails to perform intended function) as well as hardware failures.
The following general recommended practices apply:
— Components and materials should be selected and appropriate standards of quality control and test 
procedures should be employed to obtain the lowest practical hardware failure rates for individual 
items of CBTC equipment (i.e., maximize the hardware portion of the system MTBF).
— Unless non-redundant equipment is sufficiently reliable to satisfy the overall system availability 
requirements, appropriate levels of equipment redundancy should be employed such that the failure 
of a single component, processor, or device does not render the CBTC system unavailable or an 
operationally-critical function nonoperative (i.e., maximize the system MTBFF).
— A CBTC system should incorporate degraded modes of operation to minimize the operational impacts 
of equipment failures and to permit train movements to continue safely (i.e., maximize system 
availability).
— CBTC system downtime or unavailability of an operationally-critical function should be minimized 
through the use of local and remote diagnostic capabilities and appropriate operating and maintenance 
procedures [i.e., minimize mean time to repair (MTTR)].

Copyright © 2025 IEEE. All rights reserved.5.4.2  System availability requirements
Quantitative CBTC system availability requirements shall be established by the authority having jurisdiction 
with appropriate consideration of the impacts of CBTC system and subsystem failures on the operation of the 
transit system. Typical methods for defining CBTC system availability are provided in Annex  F.
As specified by the authority having jurisdiction, system availability analysis/modeling shall be used to predict 
the system availability for a given CBTC system configuration, based on equipment reliability/ maintainability 
calculations, equipment redundancy provisions, and other defined assumptions.
As specified by the authority having jurisdiction, system availability demonstration tests shall be performed to 
determine actual CBTC system availability over a defined period, to a given confidence level.
5.4.3  Equipment reliability requirements
Quantitative CBTC system and subsystem MTBF and MTBFF requirements shall be established by the 
authority having jurisdiction, consistent with the CBTC system availability requirement of 5.4.2 .
5.4.3.1  Design life
CBTC system shall have a design life of a minimum 30 years.
NOTE— The ability of a CBTC system to remain in operation to the end of its design life is driven largely by long-term 
availability of spare parts and the state of good repair and maintenance plans. Specific requirements with respect to spare 
part availability are defined by the authority having jurisdiction and do not form part of this standard.
5.4.4  Equipment maintainability requirements
A CBTC system shall be designed to minimize required maintenance (predictive, preventive, and corrective) 
by maximizing the system MTBF and by including features that provide for ease of maintenance by 
maintenance personnel.
The mean time to repair/replace a failed piece of in-service CBTC equipment (i.e., first-level repair) shall 
include on-site diagnostics, the replacement of failed components, and the testing of the repaired units, sub- 
system, or system, but shall exclude travel time to the site. A separate MTTR requirement may be defined for 
second-level repair (i.e., shop repair of a failed line replaceable unit).
The first-level MTTR shall be no greater than 30 min. The second-level MTTR, if specified, shall be no greater 
than 2  h.
Achievable repair times is driven by equipment diagnostic provisions and available test equipment, as well as 
the quality of the maintenance manuals and training. A CBTC system shall, therefore, include maintenance and 
diagnostic capabilities to detect and react to CBTC equipment failures. This shall include remote diagnostics 
capabilities as well as local built-in test equipment and other fault displays for trouble- shooting, and the 
timely identification of failed components and functions.
Data logging capabilities shall also be provided in wayside and train-borne CBTC equipment. The logged data 
shall be capable of being analyzed to be able to recreate the sequence of events leading to an incident. This 
allows maintenance personnel to identify the cause of any failure and/or mis-operation of CBTC equipment 
that cannot be identified by the in-built diagnostics of the equipment. The scope and duration of logged CBTC 
events shall be established by the authority having jurisdiction.
A CBTC system design shall include capabilities to permit periodic verification of ATP hardware, software, 
and data, including verification of correct response to interference on the train-to-wayside data link. To the 
extent specified by the authority having jurisdiction, a CBTC system shall also include capabilities to facilitate

Copyright © 2025 IEEE. All rights reserved.modifications (by the user) to CBTC system parameters, track databases, and applications software. The 
supplier of the CBTC system shall identify to the authority having jurisdiction those specific changes to CBTC 
system parameters, track databases, and applications software that have no impact on system safety.
WARNING
Changes made to CBTC system parameters, track databases, and application software, other than those 
identified by the supplier as not impacting safety, can affect safe system operation. Prior to implementing 
any such changes, applicable hazard analyses of 5.3.2  shall be reassessed to verify that the modified system 
will still meet all requirements of this standard including, but not limited to, 5.3.3 , 5.3.4 , and 5.3.5 . Changes 
shall be implemented in accordance with the CBTC SSPP of 5.3.1 .
5.5 Environmental requirements
Train-borne CBTC equipment shall comply with the requirements of IEEE  Std 1478-2013.
Wayside CBTC equipment shall be in accordance with requirements set by authority having jurisdiction.
6. Functional requirements
A CBTC system shall include the capability for providing ATP, ATO, and ATS functions. ATP functions shall 
provide fail-safe protection against collisions, excessive speed, and other hazardous conditions. ATP functions 
shall have precedence over both the ATO and ATS functions. ATO functions shall control basic operations that 
would otherwise be performed by a train operator and shall do so within the protection limits imposed by ATP. 
ATS functions shall provide system status information and the means to monitor and over- ride the automatic 
control for various functions of the system.
The CBTC train-to-wayside communications interface shall be sufficient to support all required ATP, ATO, 
and ATS functions. The data link shall provide continuous geographic coverage within CBTC territory and 
shall support train operations in tunnels, tubes, and cuts, on elevated structures, and at grade. The data link 
shall support bidirectional data transfer and shall exhibit sufficiently low latency to support the defined 
performance requirements. The data link shall include a protocol structure to support safe, timely, and secure 
delivery of train control messages.
6.1 ATP functions
All ATP functions shall be vital functions and shall be designed and implemented in accordance with 5.3. A 
CBTC system shall be capable of providing bidirectional ATP.
6.1.1  Train location/train speed determination
6.1.1.1  CBTC train location/train speed determination
CBTC train location/train speed determination shall be a required ATP function for any CBTC system 
configuration.
A CBTC system shall establish the location, speed, and travel direction of each CBTC-equipped train operating 
in CBTC territory.
CBTC train location determination shall safely and accurately establish the location of both the front and rear 
of the train. The CBTC train location determination function shall provide sufficient train location resolution 
and accuracy to support the performance and safety requirements of this standard. Train location resolution 
and accuracy parameters for typical CBTC systems are included in Annex  C.
IEEE Std 1474.1™-2025
IEEE Standard for Communications-Based Train Control (CBTC) Performance and Functional Requirements
28
Copyright © 2025 IEEE. All rights reserved.The CBTC train location determination function shall be self-initializing and shall automatically detect and 
establish the location and length of each CBTC-equipped train as it enters CBTC territory and on recovery 
from CBTC equipment failures, without requiring manual input of train location or train length data.
When awakening from sleep mode, CBTC equipment shall maintain or vitally re-establish train location.
The CBTC train speed determination function shall provide sufficient speed measurement resolution and 
accuracy to support the performance and safety requirements of this standard. Speed measurement resolution 
and accuracy parameters for typical CBTC systems are included in Annex  C.
A CBTC system shall compensate for the effects of measurement inaccuracies on train location and speed 
determination. Specifically, if the CBTC train location/speed determination function is dependent upon wheel 
rotation, the CBTC system shall correct for position errors induced by the slipping or sliding of wheels and 
shall correct for position errors caused by variation in wheel size due to wear, trueing, or replacement.
6.1.1.2  Secondary train location determination
If specified by the authority having jurisdiction, secondary train detection technology may be used to establish 
if a section of track is occupied by one or more trains, including trains not equipped with train-borne CBTC 
equipment and/or trains with inoperative train-borne CBTC equipment. This may be provided as part of 
supplementary systems or directly input or integrated into the CBTC system. It will not be necessary to 
determine the location of non-CBTC-equipped trains, or trains with inoperative train-borne CBTC equipment, 
to the same accuracy as CBTC-equipped trains.
6.1.2  Safe train separation
Safe train separation shall be a required ATP function for any CBTC system configuration.
Safe train separation shall be provided between all trains operating in CBTC territory, whether or not the trains 
are CBTC equipped.
A CBTC system shall provide safe train separation between CBTC-equipped trains. Safe train separation shall 
be based upon the principle of an instantaneous (brick wall) stop of the preceding train.
For mixed-mode operation (see 4.4), safe train separation shall be provided through supplementary systems 
and/or through strict adherence to operating procedures, as specified by the authority having jurisdiction.
If secondary train location determination is provided (see 6.1.1.2 ), then for a CBTC-equipped train following 
a non-CBTC-equipped train or a train with inoperative train-borne CBTC equipment, a CBTC system shall 
limit the movement authority of the following train to the boundary of the section of track occupied by the 
non-CBTC-equipped or failed train. If specified by the authority having jurisdiction, the CBTC system may 
further limit the movement authority to the route entry point of a route occupied by the non-CBTC-equipped 
train or failed train.
The CBTC safe train separation function shall consist of the following:
a) The calculation of the ATP profile (i.e., the profile of safe speed as a function of train location), derived 
from fixed ATP data (e.g., permanent speed limits) and variable ATP data (e.g., temporary speed limits 
and movement authority limit)
b) The supervision and enforcement of the ATP profile calculated by the CBTC system
The ATP profile shall be governed by a safe braking model (see 6.1.2.1 ) and shall ensure that under no 
circumstances (including failures) will the movement authority limit be exceeded by a CBTC-equipped train.
IEEE Std 1474.1™-2025
IEEE Standard for Communications-Based Train Control (CBTC) Performance and Functional Requirements
29
Copyright © 2025 IEEE. All rights reserved.The movement authority limit shall be the most restrictive of the following:
a) The rear of a CBTC-equipped train ahead (as determined by the CBTC train location function in 
6.1.1.1 ), with allowance for any location uncertainty
b) The boundary of a section of track occupied by a non-CBTC-equipped train or a train with inoperative 
train-borne CBTC equipment (as determined by a secondary train detection system, if provided, per 
6.1.1.2 )
c) The end-of-track (see 6.1.5 )
d) The entrance to an interlocking, when the route is not verified as aligned and locked (see 6.1.11 )
e) The boundary of a section of track with an opposing authorized travel direction or conflicting routing 
established (see 6.1.12 )
f) The boundary of a blocked track (see 6.1.13 )
g) If specified by the authority having jurisdiction, the entrance to a highway grade crossing where 
warning devices are not confirmed to be operating (see 6.1.15 )
h) The entrance to a route that is detected to be unsafe for train movement (see 6.1.16 )
If specified by the authority having jurisdiction, the CBTC safe train separation function shall support 
automatic close-up of trains and automatic coupling and uncoupling of trains in designated areas.
If specified by the authority having jurisdiction, facilities may be provided to bypass the CBTC safe train 
separation function to allow a train, under the control of a train operator, to travel beyond its movement 
authority limit (e.g., at a restricted speed).
If specified by the authority having jurisdiction, facilities may be provided to pull back (i.e., make more 
restrictive) a movement authority limit previously granted to a train. If the train were approaching or braking 
toward the original movement authority limit, the train may be in violation of the new ATP profile. Under 
such circumstances, a CBTC system shall initiate an immediate brake application. The brake application may 
be an immediate emergency brake application or a supervised service brake application, as specified by the 
authority having jurisdiction (see 6.1.3 ).
6.1.2.1  Safe braking model
A safe braking model shall be developed for each CBTC application.
The safe braking model shall, as a minimum, include consideration of the following:
a) Location uncertainty of lead train (including rollback tolerance)
b) Train length
c) Train configuration (see 4.3)
d) Allowable overspeed permitted by the CBTC system
e) Maximum CBTC speed measurement error
f) CBTC system reaction times and latencies
g) Maximum train acceleration rate possible at the time an overspeed condition is detected by the CBTC 
system
h) Worst-case reaction times to disable the propulsion system and apply the emergency brakes following 
detection of an overspeed condition by the CBTC system
i) Guaranteed emergency brake rate (GEBR)
j) Grade
IEEE Std 1474.1™-2025
IEEE Standard for Communications-Based Train Control (CBTC) Performance and Functional Requirements
30
Copyright © 2025 IEEE. All rights reserved.The GEBR shall be the minimum emergency brake rate achieved by a train on level tangent track under the 
range of environmental conditions and worst-case credible latent brake equipment failure modes, which can 
be anticipated to exist for that train in the specific application. The GEBR shall be specified by the authority 
having jurisdiction and shall include consideration of maximum train load, minimum anticipated adhesion 
levels, and maximum design tailwind.
A typical safe braking model is provided in Annex  D.
A CBTC system shall have the capability to support multiple safe braking models to accommodate different 
train acceleration/braking rates for different classes and configurations of trains operating simultaneously 
within CBTC territory and to accommodate automatic close-up and automatic coupling/uncoupling 
capabilities, as specified by the authority having jurisdiction. A CBTC system shall incorporate appropriate 
protection to ensure that the correct safe braking model is applied for a given train at a given location.
6.1.3  Overspeed protection and brake assurance
Overspeed protection shall be a required ATP function for any CBTC system configuration.
In establishing, supervising, and enforcing the ATP profile, as governed by the safe braking model of 6.1.2.1 , a 
CBTC system shall ensure that under no circumstances, including failures, the train’s actual speed exceeds its 
safe speed. The safe speed shall be derived by considering the most restrictive of the following:
a) The permanent speed limits on sections of track within the ATP profile
b) Any temporary speed restrictions on sections of track within the ATP profile
c) Any permanent speed restriction applicable to the particular class or configuration of train
d) Any speed restrictions enforced on the train because of train-borne failure conditions
e) The maximum speed that would allow the train to stop safely prior to the limit of the train’s movement 
authority or to slow down sufficiently to meet appropriate permanent or temporary speed restrictions 
upon entering that section of track
Speed limits and restrictions shall apply when any portion of the train is within the speed limit area. Speed 
limit/speed restriction resolution parameters for typical CBTC systems are included in Annex  C.
Enforcement of the calculated ATP profile shall be achieved by comparing the CBTC-determined train speed 
with the ATP profile speed at the CBTC-determined train location. If the ATP profile speed at that location is 
exceeded, the CBTC system shall initiate an immediate brake application.
The brake application may be an immediate emergency brake application or a supervised service brake 
application, as specified by the authority having jurisdiction. In the latter case, a CBTC system shall monitor 
the achieved brake rate to determine that an acceptable brake rate is achieved within a predetermined 
time frame; if not, it shall immediately apply the emergency brakes. The safe braking model shall include 
appropriate allowances for reaction times associated with this brake assurance function.
6.1.4  Rollback protection
Rollback protection shall be a required ATP function for any CBTC system configuration.
A CBTC system shall monitor actual train travel direction and shall compare measured travel direction with 
the authorized travel direction. Train motion against the authorized travel direction for more than a specified 
rollback tolerance (distance, optional velocity) shall result in the CBTC system initiating an emergency brake 
application. Rollback detection criteria for typical CBTC systems are included in Annex  C.

IEEE Standard for Communications-Based Train Control (CBTC) Performance and Functional Requirements
31
Copyright © 2025 IEEE. All rights reserved.6.1.5  End-of-track protection
End-of-track protection shall be a required ATP function for any CBTC system configuration that permits the 
operation of trains up to, or in close proximity to, an end-of-track terminus.
End-of-track protection shall be incorporated into, or function in conjunction with, overspeed protection to 
prevent trains from over-traveling the end-of-track or, if buffers are specified, to prevent trains from exceeding 
the design limits for impact with an end-of-track buffer. End-of-track protection design shall be based on the 
safe braking model of 6.1.2.1 .
6.1.6  Parted train protection and coupling and uncoupling of trains
Where separate vehicles can be coupled together in a consist of two or more vehicles or units to form a train, a 
CBTC system shall have the capability of detecting and protecting parted trains. Parted train protection shall 
be required regardless of whether the individual vehicles or units are considered to be permanently coupled or 
whether they are routinely uncoupled for maintenance or operational purposes.
A CBTC system shall also support operating requirements for coupling and uncoupling of trains, including 
automatic update of the consist length within the CBTC system.
If specified by the authority having jurisdiction, a CBTC system may assume a fixed, worst-case, maximum 
train length for a given class of trains operating in CBTC territory, with a reliance on operating procedures to 
ensure this maximum train length is not exceeded.
6.1.7  Zero speed detection
Zero speed detection shall be a required ATP function for any CBTC system configuration and shall be in 
accordance with the requirements of 5.10 of IEEE  Std 1475-2012.
Zero speed detection criteria for typical CBTC systems and applications are included in Annex  C.
6.1.8  Train door protection
6.1.8.1  Door opening control protection interlocks
If trains are operated with crews, door open control protection interlocks may be a required ATP function, at the 
option of the authority having jurisdiction. For operation of trains without crews, door open control protection 
interlocks shall be mandatory. These interlocks, if provided, shall be such that the following conditions are 
satisfied prior to enabling the opening of the train doors (and platform doors, if fitted):
a) The train is “properly aligned” at a designated stopping point, where the designated stopping point and 
required tolerances shall be as specified by the authority having jurisdiction.
b) There is a platform (or other location specified by the authority having jurisdiction) on the side of the 
train for which the door opening is allowed.
c) Zero speed is detected, in accordance with 6.1.7 .
d) The train is constrained against motion.
e) For applications where the train length exceeds usable platform length, selective door open enable 
shall prevent enabling doors not aligned with platform.
If specified by the authority having jurisdiction, facilities may be provided for a local manual bypass of the 
preceding door open control protection interlocks, for failure recovery purposes.

If required by the authority having jurisdiction, a CBTC system shall support emergency evacuation in areas 
between stations. Door release shall only be allowed for side with a designated emergency walkway.
6.1.8.3  Uncommanded train door opening
Automatic response to an uncommanded train door opening event may be a required ATP function, at the 
option of the authority having jurisdiction.
This function, if provided, shall continuously monitor the closed and locked status of all passenger doors on 
each car of the train and shall provide a safe reaction if at any time it cannot be confirmed that all passenger 
doors are closed and locked when they are being commanded closed.
The safe reaction to be taken by the CBTC system upon detection of an uncommanded train door opening 
event shall be specified by the authority having jurisdiction.
6.1.9  Platform Interlocks
6.1.9.1  Departure Interlocks
If trains are operated with crews, departure interlocks may be a required ATP function, at the option of the 
authority having jurisdiction.
For operation of trains without crews, departure interlocks shall be mandatory.
These interlocks, where required, shall prevent a stationary train from moving (e.g., by disabling the propulsion 
system and apply brakes) unless all train doors (and platform edge doors, if fitted) are properly closed and 
locked, in accordance with the requirements of 5.14 of IEEE  Std 1475-2012.
If a platform edge door to train door intrusion system is provided for a gap between train and platform edge 
door, in the event of intrusion detected, the CBTC system shall prevent train from departing.
If specified by the authority having jurisdiction, facilities may be provided for a local manual bypass of the 
preceding departure interlocks, for failure recovery purposes.
6.1.9.2  Arrival Interlocks
If trains are operated with crews, arrival interlocks may be a required ATP function, at the option of the 
authority having jurisdiction.
For operation of trains without crews, arrival interlocks shall be mandatory.
These interlocks, where required shall function as follows:
a) If platform edge doors are not closed and locked, train movement into station shall be prevented.
b) If an intrusion system is provided, in the event of intrusion detected, the CBTC system shall prevent 
train from entering station.
c) If specified by the authority having jurisdiction, facilities may be provided for a local manual bypass 
of the preceding arrival interlocks, for failure recovery purposes.

Copyright © 2025 IEEE. All rights reserved.6.1.10Emergency braking
The train’s emergency brake system shall be capable of bringing the train to a stop within the assured stopping 
distance determined by the safe braking model of 6.1.2.1 . Specific criteria for resetting the emergency brakes 
to allow normal operation to resume shall be specified by the authority having jurisdiction. If conditions (as 
determined by ATP) are not correct for train movement, the emergency braking shall remain applied regardless 
of any reset signals or actions, except that facilities may be provided for a local manual bypass of the ATP 
functions for that train to permit manual train operation for failure recovery purposes. Use of such facilities 
shall require strict adherence to operating procedures to provide for the safety of train movements. If correct 
ATP conditions exist after the emergency brakes have been reset, the train shall be permitted to move or 
continue to move; however, if the actual train speed again exceeds the ATP profile speed or a subsequent 
malfunction occurs, emergency braking shall be applied as before.
6.1.11  Route interlocking
A CBTC system shall provide route interlocking functions equivalent to conventional interlocking practice 
to prevent train collisions and derailments. These functions shall include locking of the route in advance of 
the train entering the interlocking (time or approach locking) and once the train is in the interlocking (route 
locking). The switches shall also be locked when the track section containing the switch is occupied by a 
train (detector locking). Locking functions shall also apply to moveable bridges and similar right-of-way 
apparatus. Sectional release (of routes behind a train) may be provided where specified by the authority having 
jurisdiction.
NOTE— The AREMA Communications and Signals Manual, Sections 2 and 16 [B1], provides examples of recommended 
practices for use in interlocking design.
A movement authority shall not be advanced into an interlocking until the appropriate route is set and locked. 
Once a movement authority has been advanced through an interlocking, the affected route shall not be 
released, and conflicting routes cleared unless either the train has traveled through and is verified clear of the 
interlocking or the movement authority is pulled back short of the interlocking and is in effect.
When specified by the authority having jurisdiction, interlocking functions may be provided by separate 
interlocking equipment, which is based on train position established by a secondary train detection subsystem. 
In this case, a CBTC system shall interface to and may modify the conventional interlocking functions based 
on train position established by the CBTC train location determination function, to safely enable the enhanced 
performance capabilities of a CBTC system to be realized.
6.1.11.1  CBTC interfaces to a separate interlocking
If a separate interlocking is specified, a CBTC system shall interface to interlockings as follows:
a) Time or approach locking shall apply, except in the event of a route being canceled for an approaching 
CBTC train (i.e., the movement authority is pulled back short of the interlocking and is in effect). In 
this case, if the train is greater than a safe braking distance from the entrance to the interlocking (as 
determined by the safe braking model of 6.1.2.1 ) or the train stops prior to entering the interlocking, 
the route shall be released without running further time.
b) Traffic locking may be overridden so that CBTC-equipped trains may move in opposing directions 
within their respective movement authorities on the same track at the same time.
c) Wayside signals and their aspects may be provided as specified by the authority having jurisdiction. A 
CBTC system may override the conventional aspects to cause the signal(s) to display CBTC aspect(s) 
only to CBTC-equipped trains.

34
Copyright © 2025 IEEE. All rights reserved.6.1.11.2  Responses to CBTC train location failures
In the event of a failure of the CBTC train location determination function, route locking shall remain in effect 
until the train is proven to be clear of the interlocking by the CBTC system (i.e., the train is subsequently 
determined to be clear of the interlocking limits), or through operating procedures, or a combination of both 
approaches.
In the event of a failure of the CBTC train location determination function in an interlocking where train 
location is also capable of being detected by means of a secondary system, CBTC system overrides of the 
interlocking functions may be released, provided route and other locking functions are maintained by a 
separate interlocking system so as to prevent the movement of a switch in front of and under the train until the 
train is proven to be clear of the interlocking.
6.1.11.3  Response to loss of switch indication
In the event of a loss of switch indication once a movement authority has been issued across a switch, a CBTC 
system shall pull back the movement authority to a point prior to the switch.
6.1.12  Travel direction reversal interlocks
Travel direction reversal interlocks shall be a required ATP function for any CBTC system application 
requiring bidirectional operations, in order to support reversal of train direction at terminal stations and to 
support intermediate turn backs and shuttle modes of operation, for example.
It shall not be possible to extend the movement authority for a train into a section of track for which an opposing 
authorized travel direction has already been established.
A reversal of authorized travel direction within a section of track shall not be possible unless both of the 
following are true:
a) All trains within that section of track are at zero speed and constrained against motion in the original 
authorized travel direction.
b) The movement authorities for all trains outside of that section of track do not extend into the section 
and are constrained from being extended into the section in the original authorized travel direction.
6.1.13  Work zone protection
A CBTC system shall not grant movement authorities to trains to operate into out-of-service (blocked) tracks 
or through switches blocked in other than the required position and shall enforce restricted speeds on approach 
to and through defined work zones (see 6.3.6.4 ). A CBTC system may also include capabilities to preclude 
ATO mode of operation through a work zone.
6.1.14  Broken rail detection
Where specified by the authority having jurisdiction, a CBTC system may interface to an external system for 
purposes of broken rail detection. A CBTC system’s reaction to a detected broken rail shall be as specified by 
the authority having jurisdiction.
6.1.15  Highway grade-crossing warning
Where highway crossings at grade exist within the limits of CBTC territory and where specified by the authority 
having jurisdiction, a CBTC system may interface to grade-crossing warning devices to permit control of such 
devices based on CBTC location reports and to coordinate movement authorities through the crossing based 
IEEE Std 1474.1™-2025

be further defined by the authority having jurisdiction and may include any of the following:
a) Constant (and consistent) warning times, independent of train speed or acceleration/deceleration
b) For trains making station stops prior to crossings, delayed activation of the warning devices until the 
train is ready to depart the station
c) An external subsystem providing status of grade crossing may modify CBTC operation, such as 
movement authority limit
d) When a train clears a crossing in multiple track areas, continued activation of the warning devices if 
the CBTC system predicts a second train will reactivate the devices within a predefined time interval
e) Advance warning for priority control of highway traffic signals or other highway signage, (e.g., as 
described in IEEE  Std 1570-2002)
6.1.16  Restricted route protections
Where specified by the authority having jurisdiction, a CBTC system shall include capabilities to prevent a 
train from entering a route that is unsafe for movement of that type of train due to mechanical, civil, electrical, 
or other predefined temporary or permanent conditions of the train or route, or through interfaces to intrusion 
detection devices, platform edge doors (where fitted), and/or other devices capable of detecting hazards that 
impact route integrity.
6.2 ATO functions

Typical safe braking model
D.1 Introduction
A typical safe braking model for CBTC systems is illustrated in Figure  D.1.
See IEEE  1698-2009 for additional information. [B2]
It should be noted that Figure  D.1 is not drawn to scale but is a simplistic representation to assist in the 
understanding of a typical CBTC safe braking model. It should also be noted that the safe braking model 
outlined here is defined for level tangent track and would need to be adjusted for grades. The safe braking 
parameters may be different depending on covered versus uncovered track.
In Figure  D.1, the emergency brake curve  is the worst-case, open-loop, speed/distance curve a train will 
follow once the ATP has initiated an emergency brake application. This emergency brake curve is always less 
than or equal to the safe speed curve , where safe speed  is defined as the speed above which a critical hazard 
(derailment or collision) could occur.
In this model, safety factors are accounted for in the emergency brake curve, train position uncertainties, and 
other additional measurement tolerances incorporated in the CBTC system design, and there is no requirement 
to add additional safety margins.
The ATP overspeed detection curve  is the speed-distance curve that the ATP subsystem uses to immediately 
initiate an emergency brake application, if the ATP subsystem detects that the measured speed exceeds this 
curve at the measured train location. When the ATP subsystem has initiated an emergency brake application, 
the ATP subsystem is no longer in the control loop, and the train will emergency brake at or below the 
emergency brake curve. The emergency brake curve includes an initial propulsion runaway  period, until 
propulsion is disabled.
The ATP profile curve  is the speed-distance curve that is an ATP overspeed allowance  below the ATP over- 
speed detection curve. The ATP profile is the base curve used by the ATP subsystem.
D.2 Train-borne CBTC response time (A)
In Figure  D.1, it is assumed that the CBTC system will measure the train speed and train location (relative to 
its movement authority limit) and compare the measured speed with the ATP profile speed at that measured 
location, every A seconds (worst case).
In Figure  D.1, point X represents the situation where the CBTC measured speed is just below the ATP over- 
speed detection curve at the ATP measured location, i.e., although the ATP measured speed is above the ATP 
profile, it is still within the ATP overspeed allowance. As such, the CBTC system will not initiate emergency 
braking.
However, because of worst-case speed and location measurement errors (position uncertainty), it is possible 
that the actual speed and actual location of the train could be a point Y .
At this point in time, although the train operator and/or ATO subsystem would normally be attempting to 
bring the train speed down to the ATP profile speed, it is assumed that a failure occurs that results in the train 
accelerating rather than braking.
IEEE Std 1474.1™-2025
IEEE Standard for Communications-Based Train Control (CBTC) Performance and Functional Requirements
46
Copyright © 2025 IEEE. All rights reserved.A seconds later, this situation will be detected by the CBTC system (point Z in Figure  D.1), as the CBTC 
measured speed will now clearly be in excess of the ATP overspeed detection curve, and the CBTC system will 
immediately initiate an open-loop emergency brake application.
The speed at point Z therefore represents the maximum speed that a train can achieve above the ATP profile 
due to CBTC system’s worst-case response times and measurement errors.
At this point, the remaining contributions to the safe braking model are determined by the vehicle characteristics 
only.
D.3 Propulsion disable response time (B)
During this component of the safe braking model (labeled B in Figure  D.1), the train continues to accelerate 
until the train propulsion system has been disabled in response to the CBTC system initiating an emergency 
brake application.
D.4 Coast time (C)
During this component of the safe braking model (labeled C in Figure  D.1), the train is assumed to be coasting 
at the maximum speed achieved as a result of the train accelerating prior to propulsion being disabled. This 
component of the safe braking model ends when emergency braking begins to take effect.
D.5 Emergency brake build-up time (D)
During this component of the safe braking model (labeled D in Figure  D.1), the emergency brake rate will 
build up from zero to at least the GEBR.
D.6 Emergency braking at GEBR (E)
During this component of the safe braking model (labeled E in Figure  D.1), the train continues to decelerate at 
the GEBR until the train comes to zero speed.
NOTE— The components D and E may be integrated into an equivalent single brake curve.
D.7 Position uncertainty
The safe braking model shall include the maximum distance due to measurement inaccuracy by the CBTC 
system for both the leading and following train.

(informative)
Typical approaches to specifying CBTC system availability
F.1 Traditional equipment-based  approach
The traditional approach to defining system availability is the probability that the system is capable of 
operating and performing its intended function at a random point in time, as determined by the system MTBFF 
and MTTRS, as shown in Equation (F.1) :
 CBTC system availability =   system MTBFF  ⁄  (system MTBFF + system MTTRS )    (F.1)
where system MTTRS is the sum of the system MTTR and the mean travel times for maintenance personnel to 
travel to the site of a failure and meantime to detect failure.
With this approach, the authority having jurisdiction would typically specify the following:
a) The quantitative CBTC system availability requirements
b) The average travel times to be assumed for maintenance personnel to travel to the site of a failure
c) The boundaries of the CBTC system covered by the availability requirement
d) The type of CBTC failures to be included in defining the system MTBFF
For a given CBTC system configuration, the predicted CBTC system availability could be determined 
analytically from estimates of subsystem MTBFFs and MTTRs.
Actual CBTC system availability could be determined from measurements of actual in-service system MTBFF 
and MTTRS, with appropriate adjustments for factors that are not included within the specified boundaries of 
the CBTC system.
F.2 Alternative delayed trip-based  approach
An alternative approach is to define CBTC system availability in terms of the system’s contributions to the 
desired on-time performance of the transit system, as shown in Equation (F.2) :
 CBTC   system   availability = 1    −      Σ  w  x   Revenue trips delayed more than   t  x    by CBTC Type failure     ____________________________________________________     Total scheduled revenue trips        (F.2)
where
 Revenue trip   is a scheduled movement of a train, of defined length, from a point of origin to a
   destination,  
  t  x      is a defined delay threshold,  
  w  x      is a weighting factor associated with that delay threshold  
With this approach, CBTC system availability would take into account the delays experienced by passengers. 
As the passenger judges transit system availability on the basis of the wait and travel time variations of the 
service provided, CBTC system failures that result in longer delays are penalized with a greater weighting 
factor than failures that result in shorter delays. In general, delay thresholds would be related to the operating 
headways, as delays at shorter headways impact on-time performance more significantly.
IEEE Std 1474.1™-2025
IEEE Standard for Communications-Based Train Control (CBTC) Performance and Functional Requirements
59
Copyright © 2025 IEEE. All rights reserved.The CBTC system availability requirement may also consider other failure types, to the extent that such failures 
impact fleet availability. For example, even if a train-borne CBTC equipment failure does not immediately 
impact the on-time performance of the transit system, it may subsequently result in missed revenue trips if the 
failure repair time results in the train being unavailable for service.
With this approach, the authority having jurisdiction would typically specify the following:
a) The quantitative CBTC system availability requirements
b) The various delay thresholds and weighting factors
c) The average travel times to be assumed for maintenance personnel to travel to the site of a failure
d) The boundaries of the CBTC system covered by the availability requirements
e) The type of CBTC failures to be included in defining the system availability
For a given CBTC system configuration, the predicted CBTC system availability could be determined through 
computer modeling from estimates of subsystem MTBFFs and MTTRs, and an assumed system operating 
plan.
Actual CBTC system availability could be determined from measurements of actual in-service delays, with 
appropriate adjustments for factors that are not included within the specified boundaries of the CBTC system.
