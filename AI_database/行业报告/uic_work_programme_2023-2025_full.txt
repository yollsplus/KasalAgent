The Region, despite the positive prospects; is

implies
lack of efficiency and involvement of members。
The various actions carried out by the Presidency of the Africa Region and the

have led to the establishment of
new ambition for the region:
In particular; the Covid-lg crisis has enabled Us to meet every two
months for
African Rail Thursdays。
This paradoxical effect of a crisis has allowed us to realise that we have important
tasks ahead OfUs to develop railin Africa, with four majoraxes:
To succeed in the digitalisation of the African railways;
To increase the power of the training actions and the African projects;
Adapting UIC technical specifications to the African context through a rein-

Knowing what the members' and countries' needs are by improving the qual-

Monitoring and establishing railway investment projects in the region;

Sharing best practices, transferring technology, and training,

The recent work programmes were complemented by initiatives on:
Openness towards new members;
Creating new activities in the region
Cooperating with other regions and between members;
Interoperability and connectivity along corridors

the greatest number of UIC members (120 at the time of writing) these being
fairly evenly spread amongst the active;
associate
and affiliate categories of
membership and in every area of the Region。
The railways
in the European
Region have been typically the
most active in
generating ideas for and enabling the funding for the annual programme of
projects. Much of these projects were spawned as
a result Of the publication of
the versions of the Regional Technical Strategy Europe (RTSE) and the Railway
Standardisation Strategy Europe (RSSE)。
There is an appetite amongst the European members for these regional projects
to be expanded to other UIC regions and the Regional members welcome the
idea of the inter-regional exchange platform to decide on priorities in terms of
development, exchange; and common standardisation activities。
UIC has published
Wide range oftechnical documents with the first Leaflet
having been published in 1926. Since its creation in the late 198Os, the European
Standardisation Organisation CEN_CENELEC have been offered the opportunity;
Via a Technical Cooperation Agreement, to have access to these documents for

FORLATINAMERICA
Today the UIC members consist of two associations: the Latin American Railway
Association (ALAF)
with its headquarters in
Buenos Aires, and
the Brazilian
National Association of Passenger Rail Operators (ANPTrilhos).
UIC
Was
able
to
gain insight
into
their
railway's potential for development
through the Visits by the Director-General and the LARA Region coordinator to
multiple Latin American countries;
as Well as meetings With leaders
especially
transport ministers,
to take place in the following countries:
Argentina;
Brazil,
Chile; Paraguay, Uruguay, Colombia and Ecuador。
The meetings in Argentina brought together other potential UIC members such
as Bolivia; Guatemala, and Peru. Certain Central American countries might also
be interested such as EI Salvador; Honduras; Nicaragua; Panama and Costa Rica_
Following these efforts to promote the Association, Chilean railway operator EFE
and JSC, the Argentinian National Agency of Safety Will respectively become an
associate memberand an affiliate member ofUICas of 2023.
large number of
potential projects have been identified where UIC can assist the members ofthe
region in their implementation.
To this end, in addition to maintaining the relationship With current UIC members;
UIC has hired a person in the area to Work on subjects of interest to the region;
and constitute the beginnings ofa UIC office there:
The region's needs are substantial as the national networks are either hardly Or
not at all connected,and there is
a real lack of best practices and standards。

Goals for the 2023
2025 period include:
Developing
Vision 2050 for the Region to foster
the growth ofrailin Latin America;
Creating
a network of experts that could supportan
increasing number of railway projects in the region;
Sharing knowledge from the UIC working groups
and from international standards;

The UIC Middle-East Region comprises around 15 members, spread across almost
all Of the RAME countries, which
are: Turkey; Iran; Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Jordan;
the United Arab Emirates, Afghanistan, Syria,and Israel. This is a Very dynamic
region forthe railway sector, with new high-speed lines and trains, infrastructure;
and services being developed
AlLof the countries in the region have plans for
the years to come
TWO
new members will join this region end 2023: Etihad Rail from United Arab
Emirates and Oman Rail。
Incidentally, transporting goods
between
China and Europe
Via
the southern
corridor, going Via Iran
and Turkey in particular is becoming
more
important。
Despite railways not being developed at the same rate across the board, given
that there are geopolitical, strategic, and financial differences between countries;
UIC has seen a resurgence of activity thanks to the leadership from the Chairand
Vice-Chairs who have given a new lease of life to the region's activities。
The regional roadmap for
the 2023
2025 period follows the considerations
outlined in the Vision 2050 document produced by the Paris and Dubai-based
company IEC and delivered to the November 2022 RAME Regional Assembly in

Despite it being
Very large geographic region;
the

company
(Amtrak);
the
American
Federal
Railroad
Administration
(FRA),
Canada's Railway Association (RAC), the Canadian passenger company VIA-Rail,
California High-Speed Rail Autority (CHSRA)and the Regulatory Agency for Rail
Transport (ARTF; Mexico ). These form the bedrock of the region's structure
Amongst the topics which the region wishes to tackle in 2023 and beyond are:
Standards
understanding the working relationship between the
AARand
UIC publications and developing synergies;
Sustainability
advocating the railways in the region as
significant part of
the reduction of transport carbon emissions;
Stations
developing the station as the welcoming and SMART first point of
contact for the end-user with the network,
Cyber Security
working with other regions to stem the impact from posSi-
ble attacks,
Safety。
Inevitably, as the Region grows its interests; there will be additions made to this
route map. There is a plan for the annual Regional Assembly in March 2023 and
for this to be coupled to a High-Level Exchange Meeting like the ones that have
been arranged in Europe。
