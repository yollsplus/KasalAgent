EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Passenger
traffic
has
Significantly
increased
OVer
the
Iast
few
decades;
straining
existing
technologies and making further capacity increases through traditional methods unfeasible. Current
signalling systems have reached their limits. However;
new alternatives that align with European
objectives
suchas creating a high-capacity, integrated railway network by removing interoperability
barriers; providing full integration solutions; and speeding up innovation
Offer a
Way forward。
ERTMSIETCS Hybrid Level 3 (HL3), currently known as Hybrid Train Detection (HTD), is one of the
implementations
that fulfils these
purposes。
In
the
context of
FP2
R2DATO,
WP37
aims
at
developing migration and deployment strategies to accelerate the implementation of HTD。
In this
deliverable;
We set the requirements specification for the simulations that will be performed by FP1
WP8/9.
To this end,
We provide a methodology for defining the requirements specification to FP1
WP8/9. In particular, we define performance indicators related to capacity and robustness; where
capacity is assessed in simulations Without external delays and robustness in simulations
with
external delays (compared to the undelayed simulations).
This deliverable addresses the basis of the urgent need for railway signalling innovative solutions to
enhance railway capacity and efficiency。
passengers are affected by these constraints, and
the consequences
Of
not addressing
these issues
could
severely impact
the reliability
and
sustainability Of Europe's transportation network. This report seeks case studies in various European
countries to bridge existing gaps and foster consensus on the future direction of railway signalling
technology deployment, particularly focusing on ETCS HTD,
Which offers a balanced solution that
combines
the
benefits
of
modern
train
control technologies
With
the
practicality
and
COst-
effectiveness of using existing infrastructure。
This makes 计
an attractive option for rail operators
looking to enhance their systems without incurring the high costs and complexities associated with
full-scale replacements or
upgrades。
Existing literature
and prior research highlighted the potential benefits and initial successes of
HL3IHTD. However, significant gaps remains, particularly in real-world applicability and performance
under varied conditions. Our approach involves a comprehensive analysis of the state-of-the-art of
ERTMSIETCS, followed by the investigation of various case studies and variables pertaining to the
HTD design. These variables are the size of the Trackside Train Detection (TTD) blocks, the size of
the
Virtual Sub Sections (VSS) and the share
Or types of trains equipped
with
Train Integrity
Monitoring (TIM).
The scope encompasses Various scenarios across fifteen rail lines and networks
in Europe; namely Spain, France; Sweden and the Netherlands. The case studies Vary in terms of
infrastructure; traffic, general assumptions and scenarios. In particular, the level of complexity can
be different depending on the investigated set of performance indicators and scenarios, as Well as
on the market segment. The investigated market segments include high-speed, mainline; regional,
(sub)urban and freight railways. By collaborating with key stakeholders and industry experts, these
specifications Will be simulated on CAF tool (for the Spanish cases) and RailSys tool (for the Dutch;
Swedish and French cases) to model and analyse different performance indicators under various
scenarios, including traffic and infrastructure conditions.
The added value of this deliverable is to check based on these requirements specification in Which
design configurations, scenarios, market segments and cases HTD can be mostly beneficial.
This
would allow to find the scenarios that would significantly reduce headways, allowing for more trains
to operate safely on the same tracks, thus addressing congestion issues effectively。
The
findings
from these test specifications Will underscore the EU's added value in standardising and supporting
advanced rail technologies, promoting a more integrated and efficient European rail network。

Future
Works
within

WP37
Will
include
the
development of the methodology for optimised placement of (virtual) blocks and determining ETCS
HL3 capacity impact analysis based on the FPI
WP8/9 simulations。
In addition, next steps Will
involve evaluating the market acceptance; with a focus on harmonising standards and regulations to
facilitate Widespread adoption. Continuous advancements in technology and simulation models for
various market segments and cases in Europe Will be cruciall in refining the system and ensuring its
readiness for broader implementation。

INTRODUCTION
Throughout Europe; passenger traffic has significantly increased over the last few decades; Which
has led to
a limitation Of the existing technologies to
meet future projected demand. Existing
signalling systems have been exploited to such
an
extent that capacity increase by
means of
conventional methods is no longer possible. However,
new alternatives that fit the overall European
objectives (e.9., to
deliver
3
high-capacity integrated European railway network by eliminating
barriers to interoperability, providing solutions for full integration, and achieving faster uptake and
deployment
of innovation) represent
3
step
ahead
to
tackle
the
abovementioned
limitation:
Digitalisation and automation solutions for rail operation (e.9., Automatic Train Operation (ATO) up
to Grade of Automation (GoA)4, ETCS Hybrid Train Detection and Moving Block and Advanced Safe
Train Positioning (ASTP) among others).
Deliverable 037.3 belongs to FP2 WP37 'ETCS HL3 Deployment Strategies' that aims at developing
migration and deployment strategies to accelerate the application of ETCS Hybrid Level 3, currently
known as Hybrid Train Detection (HTD), which consequently reap the benefits as quickly as possible
and avoids costly investments in new infrastructure as much as possible。
2.1
RELATIONS WITH OTHER FLAGSHIPS, WORK PACKAGES AND DELIVERABLES IN
EUROPE'S RAlL
037.3 relates to FP2 WP15 'Hybrid Level 3 Specification' Whose main objective is to align and
integrate the HTD approach into the future Functional Railway System Architecture defined by the
System Pillar and to apply the defined principles to different kinds of railways. 037.3 also relates to
publicly available documents on ETCS HL3 specifications published by the ERTMS Users Group
(EUG)。
This deliverable is a main input to FP1 WP8 'Development
Simulation and operational feedback for
improved planning'
and
FP1
WP9
'Demonstration
Simulation
and operational feedback for
improved planning' . FP1 WP8/9 will perform the capacity simulations that align with the requirements
specification defined in this deliverable. 037.3 also has dependencies with 037.1 'Standardisation
and deployment' since the requirements specification are crucial when defining standardisation and
deployment. In addition, it relates to 037.2 'Methodology for optimised placement of (virtual) blocks'
since based on the input that will be received from FP1 WP8/9, the method for optimising the design
of blocks will be defined.In a further step, the results from 037.2 and from the capacity studies in
FPI WP8/9 will be used as input for 037.4 'Determining ETCS HL3 capacity impact analysis using
Simulations'.
2.2
OBJECTIVE AND SCOPE
The main objective of this deliverable is to describe the requirements specification for the capacity
simulation studies. In particular, this deliverable aims at providing the performance indicators and
scenarios to be included in FPI WP8 and calculated in FP1 WPg in order to find the right method
for applying HTD in several environments and for various market segments. These Work packages
will perform research on the railway capacity and the number of trains that can be handled, given
several infrastructure designs, timetables and technologies installed on the infrastructure side and

train side of the railway system. The description of the scenarios therefore focuses on finding the
different methods for infrastructure design from a railway capacity perspective. This deliverable sets
the basis for these work packages; that will also perform part of the research on the robustness of
the railway system for disturbances。
This will be done with only deterministic delays. Stochastic
delays are excluded here;
because of the lack of good input data (there are no comparable HTD
systems in operation). In addition, the reproduction of a scenario in a stochastic environment and
the comparison of the results is more difficult (due to the different propagation of knock-on delays
based on input delays):
This deliverable focuses on the simulation specifications that will be sent to EU Rail FP1 WP8/9 for
calculation and simulation. The analysis of the results of WP8/9 will be performed in Deliverables
037.2 and
037.4 and Will there lead to conclusions
On
block layouts and optimal deployment
strategies。

ERTMSIETCS OVERVIEW
The European Railway Traffic Management System (ERTMS), as introduced in the newly published
Technical Specification for Interoperability (CCS TSI 2023/1695), is being implemented all around
Europe to ensure interoperability. ERTMS includes the European Train Control System (ETCS) for
automatic train protection, the first baseline of ATO up to
GOA2, the Global System for Mobile
Communications
for Railways (GSM-R)
and
FRCMS。
Improving
the
Safety
Of
national
and
international train traffic; bringing benefit in terms of Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of the entire
Control Command and Signalling system (CCS), by reducing trackside assets, and increasing
capacity are among the most relevant advantages of ERTMS.
Depending on the application level, ETCS trackside and on-board subsystems are characterized by
specific equipment on both the track and the train, their interaction, and their functions。
The ETCS
levels establish different uses of ERTMS as a train control system [1]:
ETCS Level 1: track-to-train spot communications, where a significant and costly amount of
trackside elements are required to control the movement of the train. Train detection and
train separation
are performed by the trackside equipment of the underlying signalling
system。
ETCS Level 2: continuous communications between the train and the track, which enable a
reduction
in
OPEX and
CAPEX and increase
line
capacity.
Train
detection
and
train
separation can be performed by the Radio Block Centre (in cooperation With the train Which
sends position reports and train integrity information) andlor by other trackside equipment。
ETCS Level 2 is therefore a crucial player in the search for delivering better capacity, reducing costs;
improving flexibility, and increasing reliability of the railway network since dependency on trackside
equipment is minimized.
ETCS Hybrid Level 3 (HL3), currently known as Hybrid Train Detection (HTD) based on the ERTMS
Users Group [2], is one of the ETCS L2 implementations that fulfils these purposes. In the context
of R2DATO,
IP37
aims at developing migration and deployment strategies to accelerate the
implementation of HTD。
HTD is a concept that uses pre-configured fixed virtual blocks for the separation of trains. The virtual
blocks can be used by trains that are able to send integrity confirmation in the position report, While
trackside train detection is still used for the separation of trains Which are not able to send integrity
confirmation.
The trackside train detection is also used for the handling of degraded situations。
The
main advantage
of HTD
is the reduction
of trackside implementation
cost (extending
current
Trackside Train Detection (TTD) blocks), an improved capacity performance (by introducing shorter
blocks ), or a combination of both。
3.1
ETCS HYBRID LEVEL 3/HYBRID TRAIN DETECTION OBJECTIVE
The ERTMS Users Group [2] discuss how ETCS HL3IHTD aims at increasing line capacity and
optimizing the use of existing infrastructure. HTD improves train detection and safety by combining
track-side and on-board
systems. In addition, HTD facilitates a smooth transition from conventional
systems and ensures compatibility. Therefore;
the main goal of HTD is to improve railway system
capacity, safety, and efficiency While reducing costs and enhancing operational flexibility.

Figure 1: Current ERTMS architecture defined in the TSI [3]
Regarding this architecture and the associated functionality of HTD, the following considerations are
made:
In general, the trains Without ETCS but with the National System can be managed in HTD as "ghost
trains" (detected by the TTD but not reporting its location to the trackside). These features are subject
to specific application analyses, as the behaviour of the National System is not harmonised。
The HTD-ready trains are generally expected to be equipped at least With a system providing the
train integrity information to the EVC (OTI-I) and optionally a system providing the safe train length
(OTI-L). Integrated devices providing more than one information are possible. Trains equipped with
ETCS but without OTI-I can be allowed in HTD, but treated as non-integer trains; still having the

HTD performance however giving to the following train a performance analogue to ERTMS Level 2
with only TTD.
The functionality of the system relies in the Hybrid Train Detection Concept. This concept is based
on the following essential componentslfunctionalities:
Positive Train Detection (PTD): PTD relies on information received from the train itself。 It
uses position reports sent by the train, including data such as position, integrity status, and
safe train length. When a train reports "integrity confirmed,
it becomes an "integertrain" . The
trackside
Can
USe
this information
to
determine
the train's location
and manage train
movements. PTD allows for reduced trackside infrastructure since it does not rely solely on
physical sensors (such as track circuits or axle counters).
Trackside Train Detection (TTD): TTD is the conventional method of train detection using
physical sensors installed along the track (e.9., track circuits or axle counters). In the HTD
System, the TTD sections are subdivided into smaller units called Virtual Sub-Sections
(VSSs). Each VSS corresponds to a portion of the TTD section and has its own occupation
status (free, occupied, ambiguous or unknown). TTD information can confirm Whether a train
is or not physically present on a VSS。
Virtual Sub-Sections (VSS): VSSs are the building blocks of the HTD system. They allow for
finer granularity in train separation. Each VSS can be in one of four states (based on trackside
information):
Free: No train is located on the VSS.
Occupied: An integer train is present on the VSS,and no other vehicle is behind i
Ambiguous:
A
train is present, but there might be another non-connected vehicle
behind i。
Unknown: No train is confirmed on the VSS, but its status is uncertain。
VSS states are dynamically updated by means of a VSS state machine;
Which is operated
based
mainly
On
position reports;
TTD information;
the status of the
HTD timers
and
Movement Authority (MA) information.
Train Location: The concept of "train location" defines the trackside view of the portion of
track currently occupied by a connected train. The front end of the train location is determined
by the train's max safe front end position and train detection information. According to the
EUG document on the HTD Principles (published on 16 July 2024), the front end of the train
location is not depending on the integrity status. The train integrity is based on the rear end
of the train location Which is "established" for a train treated as integer or "assumed" for a
train Which is not treated as an integer [2].
Therefore;
the rear end of the train location is
either "established rear end" (for integertrains) or "assumed rear end" (for non-integertrains):
HTD timers: For handling degraded situations, there are two types of timers defined within
the HTD concept:
Waiting timers: they are aimed to avoid unnecessary changes in the state of a VSS
due to the asynchronicity of train position, train integrity and TTD information。
are:
Mute timer: used at the trackside for each connected train to consider after a
defined time that the communication With that train is lost;
Wait integrity timer: used at the trackside for each connected train to consider
after a defined time that the integrity of that train is lost When

Shadow train timer: used to prevent wrongful detection of shadow trains

Propagation timers:
are implemented in the trackside to
avoid unnecessary

to VSS sections for Which there is no immediate
risk that a rail vehicle could be located on them. They are:
disconnect propagation timer: used at the trackside for each track section to
consider after a
defined time that an "unknown" track section should
be
propagated after train disconnection;
ghost train propagation timer: used to prevent the risk of undetected ghost
trains;
integrity loss propagation timer: used at the trackside for each track section to

The introduction of VSS in general does not change the principles of route setting and handling of
MAs since VSSs are treated in the same way as sections with TTD。
HTD is an enhanced train
detection concept too allow an optiomal use of PTD and TTD train detection systems. HTD can be
used in train centric or geographical safety sytems and with conventional signalling systems。
The

METHODOLOGY
This chapter presents the methodology used for defining the requirements specification to
FPI
WP8/9.In particular, in section 4.1 we present the performance indicators for the capacity simulation
studies. In 4.2 We define the set-up of scenarios and variables, followed by the description of the
simulation environments CAF tool and RailSys in 4.3.
4.1
PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
There are several performance indicators to be assessed after executing the simulations. Together,
these performance indicators Will provide a complete overview of the effects of ERTMS HL3IHTD
regarding capacity. These relate to the general terms of capacity and robustness。
The capacity Will
be assessed in simulations Without external delays and the robustness in simulations With external
delays (compared to the undelayed simulation)。
Both require different performance indicators that
are elaborated in Table
and Table 2-
The definitions of the performance indicators for scenarios without external delays are explained in
Table 1.

The scenarios of the Swedish southern mainline and the Dutch SAAL corridor will be assessed
further for the aspect of robustness by letting a train block the other traffic for a set number of
minutes. This gives the insight in how quickly the block layout given a particular traffic pattern helps
to solve the congestion. The definitions of the performance indicators for scenarios with external
delays are explained in Table 2.

SET UP OF SCENARIOS AND VARIABLES
This section describes how the scenarios have been set-up to achieve the aim of this deliverable。
Note that there are several benefits of HTD that will not be the focus of this deliverable. Only research
related to capacity and robustness will be the focus of these case studies as stated in Section 4.1.
For capacity, the headway between two following trains will be computed or the relative capacity
utilisation of a full timetable will be calculated. For robustness calculations, some scenarios will be
set up in Which a train blocks the corridor for a set time period, where the aim is to study the recovery
time, number of affected trains and total delay。
Simulation With stochastic disruptions Will not be included in this stage, for several reasons。
The
input data of real disruptions is not available for future or hypothetical situations analysis, scenarios
are harder to reproduce
or compare and finally this method requires many runs
Which makes
simulation and analysis more time consuming. Overcoming these issues does not outweigh the
benefits, so stochastic analysis is not foreseen in this deliverable. Therefore, all simulations will be
deterministic with no delays or fixed delays in the simulation。
In every scenario, We define a reference situation, using the current or future base information about
the track
and calculating the headway
Or relative capacity utilisation。
After that, and through
variations of the physical blocks and incorporating virtual blocks, according to What is proposed in
each scenario, improvementin capacity will be sought in these cases Where the capacity is the main
objective. When the objective is cost reduction and only keeping equal capacity, we look for keeping
the current headway but changing the physical blocks into VSSs。
These results are used not only in this Work package in tasks T37.3 and T37.5, but also in FP2
WP32。
Each case study described in Chapter 5 includes four

to reference scenario and then build up in order to make the results comparable with only one
variable changed at a time.
The variables are described below.
Forour simulation studies of HTD there are three variables of interest: the lengths of the TTD blocks,
the lengths of the VSSs and the availability of TIMs on trains。
These Variables are defined for each
scenario and depend on the state and aim of each network。
Size Of the TTDblocks [m]:
A
benefit with HTD is the possibility to extend the current TTDs
Without affecting capacity negatively。
This means that for some scenarios Varying the size of
TTD is ofinterest。
SizeOf the VSS [m]: For creating additional capacity with additional blocks it is not necessary
anymore to add axle counters or loops, but it can be done with adding VSSs。
Therefore the
size of VSSs is crucial for the capacity computation.

SIMULATION ENVIRONMENTS
Two simulation environments Will be used in EU Rail FP1 WPg for assessing the case studies of this
work package: the tool of CAF for exploratory research based on the headway of two trains for the
Spanish case studies and RailSys for the French, Swedish and Dutch case studies that involve a
complete timetable and in some cases external delays。
Both simulation environments are briefly
described in Sections 4.3.1and 4.3.2.
4.3.1
CAF tool
The simulations for the Spanish cases will be performed in the CAF tool. It is focussed on calculating
headways. Therefore the tool needs information about the rolling stock and about the technical and
the physical characteristics of the track. The tool is limited to work with two trains at the same time:
the predecessor and its follower. According to this information, it offers the headway between them

solution.
4.3.2
RailSys
The simulation software RailSys is an integrated microscopic planning tool, developed by RMCon
RailSys is
widely used in the railway sector by infrastructure managers; railway undertakings
consulting firms and research institutes [4]. RailSys features native ERTMSIETCS support and

detailed calculations of the ETCS braking curves. Infrastructure and rolling stock are modelled on a
microscopic level,
Which provides sufficiently detailed settings for the modelling
of HTD and
analytical possibilities for the results。
Infrastructure models are needed for all scenarios Which utilise
RailSys. In case of current lines;
existing models Will be used as a basis of the studies. For some scenarios, ERTMSIETCS will need
to be implemented in the models. HTD needs to be designed and applied to all existing models for
the relevant scenarios. It is important that relevant settings are correctly used to achieve a credible
simulation result. Coordination between partners is necessary for this purpose。
For the evaluation of capacity utilisation, the UIC-406 compression method in RailSys will be used。
In RailSys, the interpretation of UIC-406 is based on the compression of sequential timetable train
paths within divided sections [4]. According to the method, RailSys identifies conflicts in the timetable
and moves affected trains exactly unhindered behind the conflicting train. The outcome from the
RailSys computation is the capacity utilisation Which will be generated from specific case studies as
described in Chapter 5

CASE STUDIES AND SCENARIOS
To fulfill the aims of developing migration and deployment strategies to accelerate the application of
ETCS HTD, the several research scenarios have been defined according to the set-up described in
the previous chapter. These scenarios are used for evaluating the requirements specification of HTD.
The lines have been chosen where the main advantages of HTD can be found, both in terms of
reduction of trackside implementation costs and improvement of capacity performance。
The general outline is that the Spanish cases and a Swedish case Will be described and analysed
based on headways。
Thereafter, the French and Swedish cases Will be assessed on capacity by
relative capacity utilisation. Finally another Swedish
case and the Dutch
CaSe
are desribed and
analysed for relative capacity utilisation and robustness aspects。

5.1.2
Traffic
The traffic of the line consists of commuter trains every 7 minutes on both Recoletos and Sol routes,
regional trains every 45 minutes through Recoletos and every 3 hours through Sol. The timetable for
the Atocha commuter lines can be found in [6].
The maximum speed of the trains is 90 kmlh.
5.1.3
General assumptions
AII the trains are equipped with TIMs in the reference scenario。
TIMs conditions are changed for the rest of the simulations as explained in the following section。
5.1.4 Scenarios
For the scenarios to be simulated in this section, two objectives are pursued. On the one hand, the
aim is to achieve an increase in capacity; on the other hand, the aim is to reduce costs. Considering
the following described conditions, the goal is to find a balance between both, cost and capacity.
In order to achieve these objectives, different scenarios are proposed to check, by simulation; 讦
firstly, the defined goals are achieved and, secondly, 讦 the results are Valid.
First, the reference scenario is defined, Which is the current track and traffic status, and will be used
to compare the restof the scenarios to be simulated. In this way, we will obtain an answer on whether
we have improved the defined
regarding the current state.
These
scenarios
are
determined
by
modifying
different
elements:
making
changes
in
the
infrastructure (TTD), modifying the integrity of the rolling stock and incorporating VSSs。
Since the objectives to be achieved for this line are both capacity improvement and cost reduction,
the chosen scenarios are the following:
In relation to traffic and rolling stock, two alternative conditions are defined: the first is that it is
assumed that commuter trains are equipped With TIMs, whereas regional trains are not equipped
with it (Scenarios
1
and 2in Table 4).
The second condition is to consider that all the trains are
equipped With TIMs (Scenarios 3 and 4 Table 4). This way, differences regarding capacity between
those
CaSeS
can be compared,
Where i could be visualized Whether a decrease in capacity is
obtained as a result When not having TIMs equipped。
Regarding TTDs, in the first scenario, the current TTD layout remains with no change. As mentioned,
the cost reduction goalis also pursued, therefore, a case Where TTDs are reduced between stations
to the minimum is defined. By reducing the number of physical TTDs;
3
cost reduction could be
obtained as a result of not installing them when designing a track。
However, xwe only reduce the TTDs, this could be reflected in a decrease in capacity, hence, VSSs
are incorporated. For the length of these, a methodology for optimal VSS lengths for each specific
line should be followed.
However, in the absence of such methodology, it is intended to make an engineering study of the
line; where the most critical sections of the track Will be identified and analyzed. Firstly, a maximum
VSS length (taking into account the TTD maximum size) is implemented, then, a simulation is runned
and a new VSS size decreased by multiples of 25 is simulated. Several iterations are performed

Traffic
Unlike the rest of the commuter network, the C-5 line has similar frequencies to the Madrid Metro
lines。
The traffic consists of commuter trains every 5 minutes during peak hours and every 10 minutes

This is the only case study
Where there is

and capacity increase;
where different

Regarding rolling stock, i is defined a case Where all the trains are equipped with TIMs and another
case Where trains are not equipped with TIMs. This Way, We could compare the two situations in
terms of capacity.
Concerning trackside conditions and in order to get a cost reduction, a condition Where TTDs are

between stations with no change in stations is defined while another condition is defined
where the current TTD layout is maintained.

5.4.2
Traffic
The traffic of the line consists of mixed traffic: freight trains every 1.5 hours, regional trains (200-250
kmlh) every 2 hours and high-speed trains (250-350 kmlh) every 3 hours。
5.4.3 General assumptions
Current trains are equipped with TIMs. For the simulations, passenger trains remain equipped with
i and freight trains Will not
5.4.4 Scenarios
The objective to reach by this simulating experiment is to
an increase in capacity. This is a
mainline with high-speed and freight traffic between Madrid and Torrejon de Velasco。
Concerning rolling stock, passenger trains Will remain all equipped With TIMs as it is more critical
because of punctuality and other possible service problems. Freight trains will not be equipped with
TIMs because it is deemed less critical than for passenger trains; primarily due to punctuality
concerns and their associated impacts。
The TTDs remain as
are now in the reference scenario。
However, VSSs are incorporated in
orderto
an increase in capacity. The VSS lengths will be the ones taken from the methodology
for reaching optimal sizes through iterations by simulating this specific scenario taking into account
the critical sections and the increase in capacity objective。

Infrastructure
The LNOBPL is a
neW
proposed high-speed line in France。
The aim of the project is to improve the
rail connection
between Brittany and Pays de Ia Loire。
Several infrastructure improvements are
proposed, including a
new high-speed line, capacity treatment of critical sections of the existing
infrastructure, and implementation of ERTMSIETCS on the existing lines. Implementing HTD on new
lines oronan existing line is seen as an option。
As the new high-speed line will not have a high capacity requirement, the study will focus on the
existing line that are planned to be equiped with ETCS. These lines have high capacity requirement
35
support mixed trafic (regional, suburban, high-speed and freight trains) The exact relevant
lines of the network where the study will be carried out are still to be determined.
5.9.2
Traffic
The aim the project is to improve the frequency of the suburban, inter-regional
and high-speed links
tolfrom

rail capacity
and
improving journey times;
While  supporting
the
development of rail freight. The traffic is mixed with high-speed train, regional trains, suburban trains
and freight trains running on the sames tracks. The planned timetable for the line Rennes

AIl freight trains running on the network will not be equipped with TIMs for the ETCS HTD scenarios.
Two scenarios for the ETCS HTD will be studied for the high-speed trains
1st
scenario: High-speed trains equipped With TIMs。
2nd scenario: High-speed trains not equipped with TIMs。
There is currently no scheme plan that shows the division of the ETCS block sections for the Britany
and Pays de Ia Loire network. Therefore; asumptions Will be made for the division of ETCS block
sections (around 1.5 km for ETCS L2 and less for ETCS HTD (length to be determined))
5.9.4 Scenarios
The interest of this case study is to determine the capacity effect of ETCS HTD compared to ETCS
level 2
as displayed in Table 12, where different scenarios Will be compared with trains equiped or
not with TIMS.
For the reference scenario, no trains will be equipped with TIMs (only ETCSL2).
For ETCS HTD, we will model a scenario with only the regionallsuburban trains equiped Wih TIMs
and a scenario with either the regionallsuburban trains and the high-speed trains equiped with TIMs。
For all scenarios, freight trains Will not be equipped With TIMs。

that there are high gradients at the start and end of the line;
Which affects the braking curves
depending on down- or
Gradients could also limit the possibility of VSS deployments, as it
Should be possible to stop and accelerate at each VSS。
The current line uses track circuit for TTD。
However; there are plans to change the TTDs to axle counters。
The timeline is not confirmed。
For
the simulation of the line; the length of model should be longer than the 6 km. This is because the
traffic on the connected lines will limit the possible capacity on Citybanan. The infrastructure layouts
of the Stockholm Citybanan case are shown in Figure 10 and Figure 11.

Dwelltime at Stockholm City is limited to 2 min during peak traffic, and

Trains also need to time the stops with platform screen doors; which can lead to extended dwell
times. In some cases, trains need to reverse to align with the screen doors. Adding strain to the
timetable, increasing the need for increasing the capacity, Which HTD can help to alleviate。

General assumptions
For the simulations, i is assumed that all other traffic (non-commuter trains) at lines connecting to
Citybanan are non-integer。
Traffic is assumed to be the same as the current timetable。
5.10.4
Scenarios
As the line has high capacity utilisation today, the performance indicator headway and the UIC-406
compression method are relevant for this case. Capacity is a prioritising criterion on this line as it is
already at its limits. Robustness could be of interest. However; as trains travel on a
much larger
network than Citybanan, the simulated network would need to be extended. Therefore, a simulation
ofthe extended network would be too complex for analysing capacity. The benchmark, i.e. signalling

System used as a starting point, should be ETCS L2,
as the line is planned to be
upgraded to
ERTMS.
The specific scenarios have been
chosen depending
On
shares of trains integrated
with train
integrity . Because all the trains occupying the line have the same train types, it can be assumed that
there will be a migration phase (where some of the train have train integrity), followed by the entire
fleet being upgraded with train integrity.
The specific value of VSS should be selected with the aim
of decreasing the headway. The Citybanan trains are already tightly packed, so the VSS should be
as Short as
possible. The document ERTMSIETCS Hybrid Train Detection: Principles [2] mentions
25 meters as an example of minimum length. However, x there are restrictions with the simulation
tool (e.9., run time of the simulation), a VSS length of up to 100 meters can be accepted。
We
therefore propose the infrastructure and traffic scenarios as presented in Table 13.

5.11.1
Infrastructure
A
greenfield railway project with aim of increasing capacity between Stockholm
and Linkoping。
Connecting to the Western Main Line at the north and to the Southern Main Line in the south。
The
goal of the project is for the line to become operational in 2035. The planning process is currently
ongoing, and the line is planned to be doubletrack with ERTMSIETCS Level 2_
The line will have five
new stations (Vagnharad, Nykoping, Skavsta, Norrkoping and Linkoping) and is planned to allow
train speeds Of 250
kmlh.
The line is part of a
future high-speed line in Sweden, connecting
Stockholm and GothenburglMalmo. Between Norrkoping-Linkoping, the line will run parallel with the
current Southern Main Line (see Figure 13).

General assumptions
Traffic is assumed to be the same as the current timetable.
5.12.4
Scenarios
Performance indicators of specific interest for the Southern Mainline are headway, the UIC-406
compression method and recovery time。
The reason is that capacity and robustness are important
aspects Of this line, as the capacity utilization is high, and the line is prone to disturbances。
The
signalling system ETCS L2 is used as benchmark, as there is an ongoing project to implement
ERTMS on the line.。
The traffic scenarios have been chosen from the assumption that different train types
Will
be
upgraded With train integrity in steps, from easy implementation to complex. For this reason, i is
assumed that railcars Will have working train integrity in a first
followed by locomotive-hauled
passenger, and lastly freight trains. The Value for VSS lengths in this case study should be from the
assumption Of a simple deployment strategy. Meaning, that the VSS lengths have a standardized
length. This is mainly because of two reasons: firstly, i simplifies the simulations in this first step of
studying the deployment strategies; secondly, studying the effect of a standardized length could be
ofinterest as it would save cost for the HTD deployment project.A standardized VSS length, in this
should bein the range of 200
500 meters. The reason for this is that similar values have been
used in earlier studies [12].
The total number of scenarios to be simulated for the Swedish Southern mainline is 16 (four train
integrity scenarios per infrastructure scenario). The scenarios for the implementation of virtual blocks
and the extension of current blocks are reported in Table 16.

5.13THE NETHERLANDS: SAAL-CORRIDOR (SCHIPHOL AIRPORT, AMSTERDAM,
ALMERE, LELYSTAD)
The SAAL-corridor is one of the busiest railway lines in the Netherlands on which a capacity increase
is planned by implementing ETCS L2. From Schiphol airport, the line runs to the intercity station of
Amsterdam Zuid,
then Via Weesp to
Almere and
ends in Lelystad。
The line contains multiple
locations Where traffic merges and diverges to other corridors。
In this section, we describe the infrastructure scenarios and traffic scenarios for the SAAL corridor。
Next, We elaborate on several assumptions thatare relevant for the Netherlands. Finally, we describe
which simulations are to be executed.
5.13.1
Infrastructure
The infrastructure consists of several parts of 4-track。
These sections lie
between Hoofddorp;
Schiphol and Amsterdam Zuid and around Weesp. Furthermore; the stations of Rai, Weesp, Almere
Centrum, Almere Oostvaarders and Lelystad Centrum provide more than 2 platform tracks. The rest
Of the line is all double track。
The reference infrastructure scenario is the base infrastructure
Which a Level 2 design from the
real project is assigned according to design version
2.0
Of February 2024.
We
will Vary two
infrastructure design parameters in order to find the ideal design principle under various conditions
of usage.propose 7 different infrastructure scenarios, based on variations around two parameters to
find the proper design principles for various usage of the:
1.
Number of axle counters
2.
Distance of virtual blocks
3
Based on these two parameters We have created seven infrastructure design scenarios that
Will be described below.
The number of TTD blocks can be varied in 3 gradations:
1.
The base infrastructure on Which a Level 2 design from the real project according to design
version 2.0 of February 2024. This is infra scenario 1-0.
2
The first HTD design, numbered 1-1, is based on the base L2 design of |-0 and assumes a
headway of approximately
1
minute without buffer times still reachable
on the TTD for
degraded situations and behind trains Without TIM。
This leads to a reduction of 50 % axle
counters as a result of the following assumptions:
Physical blocks of
2 km on tracks Without regular freight traffic, given passenger
trains running at
1
40 kmlh
Physical blocks of 0,5
km on tracks with regular freight traffic, given freight trains
running at 100 kmlh
Some shorter physical blocks near stations
No additional virtual blocks
3
The second HTD-design, numbered 14,is the base infrastructure
with only
a minimum
number of axle counters, always near other physical objects (switches and level crossings).

This leads in the worst case to trains running only at station distance in degraded situations
or behind trains without TIM.
The distance of virtual blocks can be varied in 2 gradations:
The
base infrastructure from scenario
1-1
Or
1-4
With additional virtual
blocks to further
optimise capacity。
The virtual blocks
are 200-250
meters
(usually by splitting the
designed TTD-blocks in
2
VSS):
This fits to
a
headway of approximately the timetable
resolution of 6 $ for the shortest and fastest trains. These scenarios get the numbers 1-2 and
15.
The infrastructure from scenarios |-2 and |-5 with additional virtual blocks to further optimise
capacity. The virtual blocks are 100-125 meters apart. This fits to a headway of approximately
half the timetable resolution of 3 $ for the shortest and fastest trains. These scenarios get the
numbers |-3 and 1-6.
This leads to the total of 7 infrastructure scenarios, numbered |-0 to |-6,as shown in Table 18.

area). This leads to infra scenarios |-1and |1-4 having a version on the whole scope of SAAL and on
the scope of only the Flevo line。
These infra scenarios are marked with S and F respectively。

Traffic
The SAAL-corridor contains high density mixed traffic of intercities and regional trains in an hour-
pattern, including two international
and two freight paths。
In Figure
17,
the line plan is
described.
Between Schiphol and Lelystad,
and
between Schiphol and Hilversum;
an
intercity
service runs every 15 minutes. Furthermore; there are 6 Sprinters an hour between
Almere and
Amsterdam Centraal,
4
Sprinters between
Hilversum and Amsterdam Centraal and
2 Sprinters
between Hilversum and Almere. Finally, 4 Sprinter trains run from Amsterdam Zuid to Lelystad that
do not stop at local stations between Weesp and Lelystad.
Freight paths are also part of this corridor and run twice every hour between Amsterdam Bijlmer and
Hilversum. International paths are
of regular intercity traffic on this corridor. One of the four
intercities to Lelystad runs from Brussels, and one of the intercities to Amersfoort continues to Berlin.
In this study, these trains are considered as regular national intercities.
The intercities runin a strict 15-minute interval, While all othertrains are evenly divided in this interval。
This leads to multiple short headways. Between Schiphol and Amsterdam Zuid a train runs every
2.5
3 minutes Without exception。
The most restricting part of the OV-SAAL network is between
Weesp and Almere. This time-distance diagram is visualized in Figure 18, in which the intercities are
Shown in blue。
The local trains from Amsterdam Zuid run non-stop between Weesp and Almere。
Together with all Sprinters, the structure is described from Weesp to Almere as follows: Intercity,
local train from Amsterdam Centraal, local train from Amsterdam Zuid, local train from Amsterdam
Centraal or Hilversum, Intercity. Almost all headways on Weesp and
Almere are planned at 2.5
minutes

General
assumptions
There are several assumptions specific for the Dutch network that are described in this section. AlI
of these are used to increase the applicability for the Dutch system。
The rolling stocks
We
Use for passenger trains are ICNG-13 (Intercity Nieuwe Generatie) for all
intercities in Flevoland and Hilversum, and SNG-10 (Sprinter Nieuwe Generatie) for all local trains
and express trains。
Running time supplements are applied in the timetable, and therefore need to be incorporated in the
simulation
as Well。
The running time supplement is described
as a percentage of the technical
running time。
The OV-SAAL timetable
USes 7% for all intercities, and 6% for all local trains and
express trains。
4
buffer time of 60 seconds is applied to all passenger trains。
This practically means that every
section is occupied 60 seconds after a train has left that specific section. We use this method on all
scenarios. This Value is used in order to have an additional buffer between two trains in the timetable
for the purpose of robustness, when they have to occupy the same infrastructure shortly behind each
other。

The freight paths we consider run from Kijfhoek, through Weesp to Amersfoort and further, in both
directions.
These trains have a length of 720 metres, carry 2400 tonnes and are propelled by one
BR189. Freight trains do not run with a running time supplement and do not use a buffer time。
We consider two types of dwell time。
The first is the dwell tme at small stations. On these, local
trains will dwell for 30 seconds and intercities dwell for 54 seconds. Those are the technical minimum
dwell time based both on realisation data and proces analysis of the dwell procedure。
On larger
stations, a larger value is used based on both realisation data and robustness measures. We use a
list made by ProRail that includes all intercity stations and differs for Sprinters and Intercities。
5.13.4
Scenarios
We propose
7
timetable scenarios
numbered
with
G
to
assess the impact
on capacity and
robustness. The scenarios outlined in Table 19 are based on the areas to simulate specified in Table
18. Scenarios T-1and T-3 are analysed for both the SAAL corridor and the Flevo Line; whereas T-
2 is analysed exclusively for SAAL. Scenarios T-4,T-5,T-6,and T-7 are analysed solely for the
Flevo Line
The combination of the infrastructure scenarios and tmetable scenarios lead to 31
combinations as depicted in Table 19.In all timetable scenarios except for T-3 the assumption is
that all regular passenger trains have a TIM。

The goal of this deliverable is to describe the test specification requirements for ERTMSIETCS
Hybrid Level 3 (HL3), also known as Hybrid Train Detection (HTD), to be considered in EU Rail FP1
WP8 and of which the capacity and robustness effects according to the specified performance
indicators will be calculated in EU Rail FP1
IPg.
The
methodology, case studies and scenarios
have been reviewed by partners from EU Rail FPI WP8, that are
now making preparations to
execute the required scenarios for WPg。
The scenarios are provided for seven Spanish case studies; two case studies in France, three in
Sweden and one in the Netherlands. The Spanish cases cover all five market segments: high-speed,
mainline (mixed traffic), (sub-)urban, regional and freight. They are exploratory of the headway
performance indicator. The insights can be used further in the French; Swedish and Dutch cases;
that cover the high-speed, mainline (mixed traffic) and (sub-)urban market segments。
USe also
relative capacity utilisation as a measure in order to evaluate the capacity from a line and network
perspective. Finally,
cases from Sweden (Southern mainline) and the Netherlands
(SAAL-
corridor) will be used to evaluate HTD-designs for their robustness by adding a deterministic delay
to a single train. This is measured by the performance indicators: recovery time, number of affected
trains and total delay in the system。
The scenarios are built specifically around logical combinations of infrastructure and traffic. In the
infrastructure; the variance lies in the number and positioning of trackside train detection and the
virtual subsections in between. In the traffic the variance is possible in the share and types of trains
that are equipped to fully utilise HTD by having a Train Integrity Monitor on board。
The results of the calculations of EU Rail FP1 WPg will be used in the development and evaluation
of the method for track layout with ETCS HTD, that Will be described in deliverable 37.2 of this work
package.
Another evaluation of the results will be performed in EU Rail FP2 WP32, where different
DATO-concepts are compared.
