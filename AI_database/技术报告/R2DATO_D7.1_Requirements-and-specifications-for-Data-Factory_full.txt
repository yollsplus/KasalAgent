EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Context and Objectives: The European railway industry is undergoing a significant technological
transformation, with many infrastructure managers, railway undertakings and companies aiming for
extensive automation and digitization of rail operations。
This push is geared towards enhancing
capacity and reliability in rail operations。
In this context, the R2DATO project aims to revolutionize the European railway infrastructure through
digitalization and automation, leading up to autonomous train operations.
The surge in automation and digitization necessitates a parallel increase in data generation and
utilization within the rail system. Particularly with regards to fully automated driving (referred to as
automation level 4,
Or GOA4),
the integration of sensors and
cameras is crucial for automatic
response to hazards in the rail environment through artificial intelligence (Al)  Developing Al software
for environmental perception, for instance; demands vast amounts of high-quality data. However, it's
evident that individual rail entities
may struggle to amass sufficient sensor data for adequately
training Al systems for fully automated rail operations。
There is therefore a growing consensus that a Data Factory is essential
an ecosystem that enables
sensor data to be collected, simulated , processed and shared, as well as Al-models to be generated,
certified and implemented in automated rail operations。

Figure 1: Simplified target configuration of the Data Factory
In Germany, Deutsche Bahn has launched the sector initiative Digitale Schiene Deutschland (DSD)
to facilitate this technological transformation and has set up a Data Factory prototype [20] for the
development of GoA4 fully automated driving.
Inthe R2DATO work package WP7 , the further development and expansion of the Data Factory was
driven forward and stakeholder requirements for the system were compiled . This further sharpened
the picture of the target functionalities and system and subsystem architectures were derived.
This document presents the target configuration of the Data Factory and contains the system and
subsystem requirements, as well as the requirements for data quality, annotations and security。

This study is closely related to the HADEA project CEF2 Pan-European Railway Data Factory [4],a
collaborative ecosystem
consisting
of
several individual
Data
Factories  that
enables railway
infrastructure managers and railway companies to collect, process and exchange sensor data
through a standardized infrastructure。
This document therefore presents the architecture of a Data Factory that can be integrated into a
Pan-European Data Factory。
Figure
Shows the simplified target configuration of the Data Factory with the data
from the
Vehicle via the Touchpoint to the Data Centre.
The basic functionalities, Which will be discussed in
more detail later in the document, are described in italics. The physical |T assets and the data are
Sshown in black and the toolchain with the most important platform functionalities is shown in blue.
Vehicle Data Logger: At the vanguard of data acquisition, the Vehicle Data Logger is a designated
to record onboard data on trains; capturing sensor data and crucial operational metrics and to
transfer the data manually or wirelessly to the track-side (Figure 2 and sections 2.5.1,2.5.5,2.7.10).
Data Touchpoint: Strategically placed Data Touchpoints are used for the automatic, wireless and
secure transfer of data from the Vehicle to the Data Centre (see Figure 3 and section 2.7.3).
The
Touchpoints also perform data processing and prioritisation So that only data of high quality and
importance needs to be transmitted。

Moreover, the final state of the Data Factory will include a toolchain, Which is formed from various
subsystems:
The Simulation Platform subsystem, Which generates data for various operational scenarios
and synthetic sensor data; see chapter 2.7.8.
The Data Platform, which is the central subsystem where data is stored, processed and
provided to either other subsystems or users; see chapter 2.7.2.
The ML Platform subsystem, which offers methods to generate model architectures, train
and evaluate
machine learning
models
e.9. for object detectors, predictive analytics
Or
automated decision-making; see chapter 2.7.7.
The Integration Platform, Which ensures provision of compute resources to all subsystems
and an interactive compute environment to the users; see chapter 2.7.4.
The IT System Management, Which monitors the subsystems and monitors the activities to
ensure the integrity and performance of the Data Factory; see chapter 2.7.6.
The System
Access & Security Platform
Which provides functions for identification
and
authentication, use control, System integrity, data confidentiality, restricted data flow, timely
response to events and resource availability; see chapter 2.7.9.
The Accounting Service; which ensures a transparent billing associated to utilization and
resource usage; see chapter 2.7.11.
Interconnect Platform, Which ensures the connection to external IT assets and other Data
Factories and an integration into a Pan-European Data Factory; see chapter 2.7.5
Main
Findings: The development of a Data Factory is about the comprehensive integration of data
and data processing technologies with traditional railway systems. Key components such as sensor
data acquisition With a Vehicle Data Logger, Data Touchpoints, edge components and |T assets in
the Data Centre as Well as a uniform toolchain are to be designed in such a Way that
form a
uniform platform overall.
This platform should in turn be integrated into the concept of the Pan-European Data Factory (PEDF)
[5][15], in which individual Data Factories or individual IT assets of the members are connected to
each other; realised with a high-speed backbone network [8] and implemented by defining common
data standards and interfaces. In the vision, the final expansion stage Will comprise a uniform and
shared toolchain.
This merger is intended to achieve synergy effects that will enable to master the complex tasks of
generating permissible Al functions for automated train operation in accordance with GoA4.
Recommendations for the Future: Building on Deliverable 7.1as a basis, the Data Factory should
be further developed and gradually integrated into the PEDF as described in [13] and [14]. It must
be ensured that the Data Factory remains adaptable and compatible with various railroad systems
and third-party technologies。
In summary, Report 7.1is a testament to the collaborative efforts undertaken within the R2DATO
project to create a data-centric future for rail transportation. It serves as a strategic dossier for the
Successful creation of a data and Al platform for the implementation of functions for GoA4 automated
train operation.

Frame
Single measurement from one sensor like an infrared camera,
Visual camera, lidar, orRADAR.
Frame
frame drop is the event of missing the sensor information for a
specific
in time at Which a message Was
expected
according to the Acquisition Frequency . Frame drops can happen
due to a failure in performing the message;
as Well as any Ioss of
this information on the way to the subsystem expecting the
message。
A Frame
leads to a delta between to consecutive
Frames that is twice as large as expected. Multiple Frame Drops
can OCCUr SUccessively。
Frame metadata
Describes information about a single frame; such as weather
condition, train speed, number or type of detected objects.
Everything that can be derived from existing data (e.9., in data
pipelines) is also called metadata。

Configuration
used and affects the sensor data.
It consists of serial numbers of
sensors and sensoraccessories (such as lenses), the lens
configuration and identifier of other hardware parts used in the
system。
Highest Quality
The highest quality of sensor data is the configuration of the
sensors that delivers all information that the sensor is physically
able to capture and designed to provide to the user. This means;
as an example, When the sensor can capture images with 1Gbit
image depth, choosing 1Gbit means higher quality that choosing
12bit as the 16bit image contains more information in terms of
dynamic range. Parameters that affect that data quality are
among others, the acquisition frequency, the resolution, the point
density (LiDAR); the dynamic range (camera):
As there are usually technical limitations for the system, there is
usually a trade-off to
the highest possible data quality for the
respective use-case given the system's performance.

INTRODUCTION
1.1
ABOUT DELIVERABLE 7.1
This document serves as Deliverable 7.1, titled "Requirements and Specifications on Data Factory"
underpinning the development work carried out in the context of the Shift2Rail initiative. Specifically,
this deliverable fits Within the framework of the Technology Demonstrator (TD) and Work Area (WA)
corresponding to Information Technology Solutions for Train Operation。
The R2DATO project contributes to the broader Shift2Rail objectives by targeting advancements in
rail system automation, pushing forward the boundaries toward fully autonomous train operations。
The work detailed herein contributes to the accomplishment of key objectives set out for TDNAon
Next-Generation Train Control and Communication Systems, achieving a Technology Readiness
Level (TRL) that demonstrates a significant step forward from the conceptual stage to the system
prototyping in operational environments。
Background and Project Contribution: The rail industry is at a pivotal junction, with digitalization
promising to redefine the performance; reliability, and safety standards of rail operations. Within this
evolutionary path, the R2DATO project stands out with its specific contribution to the Shift2Rail
program。
It aims to leverage data-driven methodologies to enhance the control, monitoring, and
predictive capabilities of European rail operations。
Objectives and Aim of this Deliverable: The primary objective of this deliverable is to outline the
requirements and specifications of a Data Factory and the data itself。
The data serves as backbone
for analytics and machine learning to develop
Al functions for GoA4 automated train operation
(ATO).
The Data Factory, particularly in combination With the concept of the Pan-European Data
Factory (PEDF) is envisioned as a central hub for collecting and storing huge amount of data for
Machine Learning tasks, supporting the Shift2Rail's goals of increasing efficiency and advancing
toward autonomous train operation。
Motivation: The setup of the Data Factory is motivated by the need to develop fully automated
driving With Al-functionalities for environment perception, incidence management, localization and
other functionalities。
To achieve this, huge amounts of data needs to be collected , transferred , processed an annotated,
also synthetic data needs to be simulated to generate data of rare railway scenarios. With this data
machine learning is performed to train Al-models and the data also serves for the evaluation and
testing. At the end of the process a platform is needed for certification and homologation of these
functions (see Figure 5).

MAIN PART
2.1
BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS
AND GOALS
To meet the increasing demand for transportation of both passengers and freight, R2DATO will take
the advantages of digitalisation and automation to develop the Next Generation ATO and deliver
scalable Digital and Automatic (up to Autonomous) Train Operation (DATO) capabilities in order to
enhance the capacity of the existing rail networks。
The goal of the Data Factory is to serve as a platform that provides data, in particular sensor data
and simulated synthetic data, as Well as machine learning functionality for training and evaluating
Al-models. In the future, this platform will also stream data to HiL test stands and will provide data
and tools for certification.
The goals of WP7 Data Factory are:
07.1:
Development of the
Data Factory specifications that is compatible with the PEDF
concept and the ongoing expansion of the infrastructure
07.2: Legal assessment of the Data Factory
07.3: Joint simulation of scenarios and production of synthetic sensor data
07.4: Joint collection and annotation of sensor data
07.5: Generation of sensor-based object detectors for perception using machine learning
07.6:
Provision
Of
an
Open-Data-Set consisting
Of
real
Sensor
data
Of
the railway
environment, associated annotations, simulated synthetic data and digital map data
The Data Factory has to be designed in such a way that it can collect and process data from up to
27 countries with different boundary conditions and rules。
We assume that only some RUs, IMs and
rail suppliers Will set up a fully developed Data Factory based on the specifications provided here.
Some stakeholders will probably only implement partial aspects
Or
USe the services of another
stakeholders data factory。
It must also be ensured that existing and planned Data Factories can be linked together in the future
to form a Pan-European Data Factory (PEDF) [4], similar to Gaiax Cartenax [21].
We also assume that once the AI models have reached a certain level of quality, the amount of data
to be collected Will decrease over the years.
The goal of the task 7.1
is to collect the requirements and specifications for the
Data Factory
infrastructure and the toolchain for the purpose of data simulation, engineering,and MLIAI model
training for GoA3/4 operation。
AlsO,
the specifications on the data itself and

2.2
SCENARIO
The basic scenario is built on following Assumptions, Experiences of similar projects and Exclusions
and Legal Considerations。
2.2.1
Assumptions
Up to 60 TB of raw sensor data will be generated per train per
For a basic data collection, the assumption is that at least 2 trains per country will be used。
Data Will be transmitted to a Data Centre or cloud for a subsequent data ingestion, preferably
Wirelessly or through other appropriate methods within the respective country or region。
The
Data Factory's setup (cloud-based, on-premise;
Or
hybrid)
will be determined after
analysing Use cases to find the optimal solution.
It is assumed that the results of the trained machine learning (ML ) models will be utilized for
the perception systems。
For certification and homologation huge amounts of data and a certified common toolchain
are necessary。
2.2.2 Project Setup Based on Experience
Data
Will
be
collected  using specially equipped
trains
with
cameras lidar;
radar
and
localization sensors, with the main data volume coming from high-resolution cameras。
Data will be transmitted into the Data Factory via network infrastructure。
In the initial stage, data annotation will be manual and in later stages semi-automatic.
The training and validation of Al-models will occur within the Data Factory.
The Data Factory will also be responsible for testing Al-models.
Regular monthly releases for training, a practice from the automobile sector, are expected。
Up to 30 training cases may be used in parallel, another insight from the automobile sector.
2.2.3
Exclusions and Legal Considerations
The rules for certification, to be determined by legal authorities, are not included in the work
package WP7 , but it is expected that all data used for training must be stored for future audits。
Operational aspects of the trained ML models and vehicle onboard perception systems are
excluded from the WP but have a significant connection with WP11.
Operational components of the Data Centre and security configuration and operation are
beyond the scope of the WP。

Results of pre projects of the sector were included as far as the Data Factory is concerned. Also, the
WP within R2Dato Was considered.
2.3.1
X2Rail4
X2Rail-4,
part
Of the
Shift2Rail  initiative,
is focused
on developing
advanced signalling
and
automation systems for railways, including specifications for Grade of Automation 314 (GoA3/4). This
project is crucial for integrating Machine Learning (ML ) outcomes from data factories into the train's
perception systems. While train-internal perception systems are outside this Work Package's scope;
the alignment of ML results with X2Rail-4's architecture is essential for seamless integration and
operational efficiency in railway systems. [17]
X2Rail4 delivers the specifications concerning GoA3/4 . Results of the Data Factory ML training must
ft to the architecture mentioned there.
Assumptions:
X2Rail-4 is tasked with developing specifications for Grades of Automation 3 and 4 (G0A3/4)
to
the architecture of train perception systems。
The results from the Data Factory's machine learning (ML ) processes are expected to align
with X2Rail-4's architectural specifications to ensure system compatibility and integration。
Boundaries:
The project does not include vehicle internal perception systems within its Work Package
(WP), delineating the scope of X2Rail-4's responsibilities。
Clear
interfaces
and
logical
infrastructure
alignment
with
X2Rail-4's
standards
are
mandatory,
even though direct involvement with
Vehicle

CEF 2 RailDataFactory
Railways in Europe are actively working on GoA4 automated rail operations. However, this requires
the collection of large amounts of sensor data for Al training
a task that can be challenging for
individual railroads or suppliers。
To tackle this problem, the concept of a pan-European Rail Data
Factory has proven to be a promising solution。
The CEF2 RailDataFactory study [4], envisioned as
a collaborative infrastructure and partner ecosystem, Offers a Way forward for RUs, IMs and railway
suppliers。
This study was carried out and successfully completed in 2023 as a joint effort between DB,
SNCF
and
NS.
Co-funded by the European Health and Digital Executive Agency (HADEA), the study
examined
Various
aspects,
including
technical,
operational,
commercial,
legal
and
strategic
considerations.
The Pan-European Railway Data Factory (PEDF) is conceptualized as a collaborative infrastructure
and ecosystem that integrates data from Various sources to enable fully automated train operation
across Europe [5] by creating a shared infrastructure for extensive sensor data collection, processing
and Al development。

Figure 7: Pan European Data Factory (PEDF) as union of many individual Data Factories
Figure 7 shows the PEDF as an interconnection and association of several individual data factories
orindividual ITassets that are to be connected via a high-speed backbone network [8]. The individual
Data Factories that are part of the PEDF can exist in different expansion stages。
What is important, however, is the definition of common data standards and interfaces, as Well as
the prospective creation of a uniform common toolchain. The basic idea of the PEDF is that each
member retains sovereignty over its data
because the (private) data
does not flow out of the
respective Data Factory . However , the members can use the partners' data to conduct data analyses
or train and evaluate Al models using the uniform toolchain. This construction is similar to Gaiax
Cartenax, see section 2.3.5 and [21].
The strategy for building the PEDF is divided into short, mid and long-term time periods as shown in
Figure 8. Initially, each stakeholder; Whether RU, IM or railway supplier; has its own proprietary
Solutions.
But in the mid-term, the first common standards for data and interfaces should help to

establish data compatibility, so that synergy potentials can be realised in the long-term by greatly
increasing the basic data population for all members [14].
These efforts to create common interfaces and a common, uniform toolchain are to be bundled in
the interface pillar and the toolchain pillar。 These represent working groups and standardisation

CEF2 RailDataFactory study carried out some initial use cases and requirements [5] and are the
basis for the requirements in this document in section 2.7.5.
The building blocks and components elaborated in the CEF2 study [6] are compatible with those in
this document (section 2.7).
The comprehensive
security assessment, the IAM concept and the data management concept
from CEF2 [7] are complementary to the System Access and Security Platform in section 2.7.9 and
the Data Platform in section 2.7.2 presented here.
The CEF2 study also highlighted the bottlenecks for data applications in vehicles [9], carried out a
business case analysis [10] and derived mitigation measures for cyber security risks [11].

2.3.4 Open Sensor Data for Rail
0SDaR23
Publicly available data sets from the railroad sector are Very rare. Therefore; the DB InfraGo AG,
within the sector initiative Digitale Schiene Deutschland (DSD), and the German Centre for Rail
Transport Research (DZSF) at the Federal Railway Authority (EBA) have created the first publicly
available multi-sensor data set, i.e. Open Sensor Data for Rail (OSDaR23) [1][2]. The sensor dataset
annotated as part of the project was recorded in several data collection runs in Hamburg by DSD。
The dataset contains regular railroad environments and scenes from regular operating as Well as
some
special situations and objects (like flames and smoke), Which were posed。

The camera modality comprises 3 medium-resolution, 3 high-resolution color cameras and 3 infrared
cameras. The three color cameras (RGB) cover a total horizontal field-of-view (FOV) of 70, whereby
the FOVs between two color cameras overlap by 105
The three infrared cameras each have a
focal length and cover a total horizontal FOV of 30
With the FOVs of the second infrared camera
overlapping by 1
The medium-resolution, high-resolution and infrared camera have a respective
resolution of 5,
12 and 1.2 megapixel。
The lidar modality comprises 3 long-range lidars,
mid-range lidar and 2 corner lidars。
The three
long-range lidars cover a total horizontal FOX of 16。
With the FOVs of two lidars overlapping by 2
The mid-range lidar has a horizontal FOV of approximately 180。
The corner lidars are mounted in
such a Way that the FOV also extends to the rear and each corner lidar thus covers approximately
270c
Whereby the entire area in front of the vehicle is covered equally by both lidars
The total
resolution of all Lidars in the setup is a maximum of 240.000 points per frame.
The radar modality consists of a long-range radar, Which has a horizontal FOV of 180c
a range
resolution of approximately 18cm and a maximum detection range of 500 meters。
The gas sensor modality has 2 sensors,
1
gas and

The sensor data in this setup Was mapped in a data model, see section 2.5.2. In addition, a strong
focus was placed on data quality. The data quality requirements can be found in section 2.5.4 and
the data recorded in the described sensor setup meets these data quality requirements。
The sensor data of this setup Was then annotated, with great emphasis placed on the quality of the
annotations。
In-depth annotation requirements were developed, Which
are presented in section
2.5.6
The annotation requirements are further developed in various projects together with the German
Centre for Rail Traffic Research (DZSF) of the German Federal Railway Authority (EBA).
Oneof these projects also resulted in the first high-quality multimodal sensor data set from the single-
railway sector OSDaR23, see section 2.3.4.

Ontology
A Sensor data
ontology is a formal description of sensor data to enable data exchange between
multiple applications across different organizations with a common understanding of the structure
and meaning of the information.
The common language provided by a sensor data ontology captures agreements on information and
structure and what this information represents, enabling smart data exchange between applications
and organizations。
Figure 11 shows the connection and hierarchy between the raw sensor data, capability and entity
metadata and the ontology.

Raw Sensor Data
Are the measured values that are generated during the measurements. The data
can be structured, semi-structured or unstructured, uncompressed or compressed.
Capability Metadata
Is the metadata that describes the properties of the raw data. On the one hand,
this is the data structure of a raw data set including nested data structures and, on the other hand
the data types of the measured values。
Entity Metadata
These are specifications of the sensor and the location where the sensor was
installed.
The specifications of

sensor include; for example;
manufacturer ID,
serial number;
measurement accuracies, temperature working range and, for cameras; focal length, bend of the
lens, and so far. The location Where the sensor Was installed is, for example;

Ontology
A
sensor data ontology is a formal description of sensor data to enable data exchange
between multiple applications across different organizations with a common understanding of the
structure and meaning of the information. Ontology is composed of Capability Metadata and Entity
Metadata.
2.5.2.2
Ontology Characteristics
A
ontology is a formal representation and must have some structured form and hast to be machine
readable.
The ontology is an explicit description of a domain and is not like a natural language text
description but is an enumeration of the entities that belong to this domain and how they relate to
each other。
2.5.2.3
RDF and OQL
Ontology Format
The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a
World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) standard
originally designed as a data model for metadata
It has come to be used as a general method for
description and exchange of graph data。
RDF provides
a
variety of syntax notations and data
serialization formats, With Turtle (Terse RDF Triple Language) currently being the most widely used
notation.
The W3C Web
Ontology Language (OWL) is a Semantic Web language designed to represent rich
and complex knowledge about things, groups of things, and relations between things. OWL is a
computational logic-based language such that knowledge expressed in OWL can be exploited by
computer programs, e.9., to verify the consistency of that knowledge or to make implicit knowledge
explicit. OWL documents, known as ontologies, can be published in the World Wide Web and may
refer to or be referred from other OWL ontologies。
2.5.2.4
Generation of Data Factory Sensor Ontologies
From the sensor data described in section 2.5.1 in total 37 ontologies were created for the cameras
(camera, infrared camera and 56 camera), Lidars, Localization sensors (GNSS and IMU);
Gas-
Particle sensors and diagnosis data (Robot). Figure 12 shows the five steps how to derive a graphical
representation of the Ontology RDF model from the sensor data.

2.5.5
Data Quality Requirements
The Data Factory provides sensor data for the development and validation of machine learning
applications. In order to provide sensor data in a sufficient quality, the incoming sensor data already
need to fulfil a set of quality criteria。
These criteria can only be satisfied by the onboard system that
produces the sensor data。
The following Data Quality Requirements
are therefore targeting the
onboard system that generates the sensor data and refer to it as the system under consideration
(SuC).
The requirements are structured thematically; starting With the requirement targeting the
sensor configuration. These requirements ensure that the configuration of the onboard system with
its sensors is known for each
in time。
The second section about data integrity ensures the
integrity of the sensor data in the whole chain from the sensors to the Data Factory. That means that
the sensor data is not being modified or corrupted while being stored ortransferred. The data content
section assures that all available sensor information is attached to the sensor data. The next three
sections target the multi-modal use of the sensor data and allows the synchronisation of multiple
modalities。
This includes requirements regarding time stamping, frequency and calibration of the
sensor data. The last two section target the ego-motion of the train. The GNSS and IMU information
section defines the required information to determine the position and motion of the train。
The ego
motion compensation section defines requirements that allow to correct or minimize artefacts in the
sensor data that are introduced by the motion of the train during the acquisition of sensor data.
2.5.5.1
Sensor Configuration
The SuC shall provide the sensor data in the Highest_Quality that is technically possible
without violating the system's performance requirements。
Rationale: The data shall be used for the development of GoA4 train operation. One
of the main Use cases is the environmental perception With its multiple tasks. In order
to fulfil the requirements of these tasks, an overall high data quality is required.A goal
is the creation of multi-modal sensor datasets。
This requires highly synchronised
Sensor data with
3
precise calibration and sensor data that allows to detect and
recognise objects as good as possible。
The SuC shall provide the sensor configuration and parameters for each Sensor_Frame。
Rationale: The sensor configuration and parameters shall be provided so that each
Sensor
Frame
can be associated
with the respective sensors configuration and
parameters。
This is required in order to be able to evaluate sensor configurations and
compare different configuration. In addition, it helps to evaluate artefacts in the sensor
data based on the configuration. For example, the rolling shutter effects depends on
the exposure time。
In order to track down errors, the serial numbers and software
versions need to be known.
The SuC shall provide the Hardware_Configuration for each Sensor_Frame.
Rationale: Knowing the hardware configuration of the system is essential to detect
misconfigured
Or
faulty
hardware
components。
Especially
for
the
hardware
configuration i is not necessary to physically attach i to each Sensor
Framebut
instead make transparent which Sensor_
Frame are recorded with which hardware.
The SuC shall provide the Software_Versions for each Sensor_
Frame.
Rationale: Knowing the software version of each software component in the system
is necessary to track down issues in specific versions of the software thatare detected

When evaluating the quality of the sensor data. Similar to the hardware version it is
not necessary to physically attach the software versions to each Sensor_
Frame but
instead make transparent Which Sensor_
Frame are recorded with Which software
Versions.
The SuC shall provide the Sensor_Parameters for each Sensor
Frame.
Rationale: Knowing the sensor parameters for each Sensor_Frameis necessary to
compare the sensor parameters at different environment conditions and evaluate the
effects of different sensor parameters on the data quality. For example, the exposure
time can influence the rolling shutter artefacts of a camera。
2.5.5.2
Data Integrity
The
SUC
Shall provide
the
unmodified
Sensor_Data_Streams
to
the
Data_Logger for
recording。
Rationale: The Sensor
Frame shall not be modified by any subsystem in order to
avoid that other Systems only having data in reduced quality. For certification of the
System it is necessary to ensure that the data is not being modified. This includes that
all Sensor
Frame are forwarded to the Data_Logger and no information is removed
from the data.
The SuC shall publish the Acquisition_Timestamp that is provided by the sensor。
Rationale: The goal is to know the acquisition timestamp when the Sensor_Frame is
physically
being
captured
by
the
Sensor。
This
requires
to
have
3
precisely
synchronised sensor and that the timestamp provided by the sensor is not overridden
with the timestamp when the sensor arrives at the driver or any other subsystem。
The SuC shall allow to verify the authenticity and integrity of each Sensor_Frame。
Rationale: It shall be possible to verify that the message is not being modified. This
Verification shall be possible at each stage in the system and in the Data Factory。
Therefore; the SuC needs to add information to each message (or provide another
method) that allows to verify the integrity and authentication of each Sensor_
Frame.
There might be sensors that do not support adding these information within the
sensor. In these cases the information should be added at the earliest possible stage
and
resource demands
and computation
time may need to
be considered and
weighted with the benefits of support an authenticity and integrity verification at that
stage。
2.5.5.3
Data Content
The SuC
Shall attach
all information
to
each
Sensor
Frame
that
are
provided by
the
manufacturer's sensor driver。
Rationale: The Data_Logger shall be able to record all sensor information that is
available in the system unless technically infeasible。
This means, that each sensor
information that is available in the system shall arrive at the Data_Logger。
The SuC shall make processed Sensor_
Data_Stream available to the Data_Logger
讦 the
processing adds information to the Sensor_Data_Stream。

Rationale: In case sensor data is processed to improve its quality or to add additional
information, the system shall be designed to enable the Data_Logger to record the
processed as well as the unprocessed data streams, i technically feasible。
2.5.5.4
Time Stamping
The SuC shall stamp all Sensor_Frames With the Acquisition_Timestamp.
Rationale: In order to precisely fuse frames that are recorded at the same
3 similar
point in time, the physical acquisition time is required. Sensor fusion Will likely be
3
concept for the environmental perception in GoA4 train operation and is required
for multi-modal data annotation.
The SuC shall provide a definition of What part of the sensor's actual physical acquisition
process the Acquisition_Timestamp is referring too.
Rationale:
Different
SensOrS
have
different
means
of
acquisition。
In
practice;
acquisition can have multiple possible reference or "anchor" points in tme, each of
Which might be equally appropriate; as long as it is clearly defined, Which one is used.
Examples: For global shutter cameras, possible references are start time of exposure
or end time of exposure. For rolling shutter cameras, this shall additionally include the
line of reference, as different lines of a rolling shutter sensor are exposed at different
times. It shall also include the line time,ie.
the time delta between the exposure start
Of successive lines。
The SuC shall provide the Reference_
Time for the system。
Rationale: It is important to have the same understanding of time in the system in
order to fuse Sensor_
Frames from different sensors to a Sensor
MFrame using the
acquisition time。
The SuC shall provide the Reference_
Time in UTC.
Rationale: Avoid
seconds errors in the data by configuring all systems to Use
UTC instead of the atomic time.
The SuC shall make the Reference_
Time available within 3Os after system boot is completed。
Rationale: To allow all systems to synchronise their time Within GOs after system boot
completed, the reference time has be available in advance。
The SuC shall provide timing signals for clock synchronisation in the system。
Rationale: The reference clocks has to provide a time synchronisation service with a
protocol. The most common one is PTP.
The SUC shall ensure clocks deviate less than
ms from the Reference_Time.
Rationale: This is necessary to allow precise stamping of acquisition times and an
accurate fusion of sensors. Common protocols such as PTP allow an accuracy up to
less than a microsecond.
The SuC shall ensure clocks
are
Synchronised to the Reference_
Time
within GOs after
system boot is completed。
Rationale: As one of the tasks in Data Factory is to ensure that the driving path is free
before the train starts moving, the data While the train is still on the parking position

is Of interest. In order to capture and use this data, the reference time in the system
shall be available within GOs after the system boot is completed。
The Acquisition_Timestamp shall deviate less than
ms from the physical acquisition time
Ofthe sensor。
Rationale: In order to allow a precise fusion Of sensor data, the acquisition timestamp
Shall be as close as possible to the physical acquisition timestamp。
The physical
acquisition time is the reference time in the the system at the
in time When the
hardware in the sensor registers the object. Common protocols such as PTP allow an
accuracy up to less than a microsecond. With a speed of 1ookmlh, the train moves
around 3cm per millisecond.
2.5.5.5
Frequency & Synchronisation
The SuC shall ensure a stable and constant Acquisition_Frequency for each sensor。
Rationale: A stable and constant acquisition frequency is required to reliably produce
synchronised sensor data that can be fused.
The
SuC
shall
ensure
that
te
Acquisition_Timestamps
between
tWO
consecutive
Sensor
Frames have
3
maximum
deviation of 5%
Or 2.5ms;
Whatever is lower to the
expected delta Which is calculated based on the target frequency (delta
1/f).
Rationale: This requirement defines the upper bounds for the requirement above by
providing concrete values for What is the lower bound for a
stable and constant
acquisition frequency. In the extreme (on sensoris -2.5 ms and the other one is +2.5
ms) this leads to an offset of Sms within a Sensor
MFrame. With a speed of 1o0kmlh
this will lead to an offset of 15cm in the Worst case
The SuC shall ensure that each Perception_Sensor uses an Acquisition_Frequency that is
an integer multiple of the Perception_Sensor With the lowest Acquisition_Frequency.
Rationale: This in mandatory in order to have multiple synchronised sensors with a
stable and constant acquisition frequency.
The
SuC
shall
ensUre
that
the
maximum
percentage
Of
Frame_Drops
per
Sensor
Data_Stream is lower than one per thousand (1/1000)
Rationale: This requirement tolerates one frame drop at a
maximum occurrence of
once every 1000 frames.
The SuC shall ensure an Acquisition_Frequency of the Perception_Sensors of at least 10
Hz。
Rationale: A frequency of 10 Hz allows to reevaluate the situation every 10Oms and
therefore 10 times a second。 It is necessary to increase the accuracy of tracking
algorithms by limiting the distance the train and objects move between two frames。
The SuC shall ensure an Acquisition_Frequency for the Coupled_Localisation of at least 50
H。
Rationale: A high update frequency of the coupled localisation is important to
the
most
accurate egomotion
information
fOr
each
Sensor
frame。
As
the coupled
localisation
consists of multiple modalities;
such
35
GNSS,

localisation,
not all modalities need to have
an update frequency of 50 Hz。

possible to update the position at 50 Hz using the IMU measurements and correct the
drift using GNSS position updates at a lower frequency.
The SuC shall trigger the acquisition of the Perception_Sensors synchronously.
Rationale:
In
order
to
fUSe
Sensor
modalities
and
Create
multi-modal
frames
(Sensor_MFrames), all Perception_Sensors have to capture their data at the same
in time. For technical reasons, there might be sensor modalities that benefit from
3
slightly shift the acquisition time of these sensors to avoid artefacts (distortions);
such as, e.9. multiple RADARs. When having a setup with multiple RADAR sensors
i is common to trigger the central RADAR together with the other perception sensors
and shift the left and right RADARs slightly in terms of acquisition time to reduce
distortion by the FMCW ramp。
The SuC shall allow a maximum difference between the Acquisition_Timestamps ofthe same
Sensor_MFrame of less than 5 ms for each Perception_Sensor。
Rationale: When the train or objects are in motion, a large time offset of the acquisition
time of different sensor modalities of the same Sensor_MFrame will introduce errors
in the sensor fusion. With a speed of 10Okmlh this Will lead to an offset of 1Scm in the
Worst Case。
This requirement implies that all synchronously triggered sensors have
to trigger within a time period of 5 ms。
2.5.5.6
Sensor Calibration
The SuC shall provide precise calibration information for each sensor。
Rationale: In order to fuse the output of different sensors; a precise calibration is
necessary. In the context of the Data Factory this is for example necessary to create
multi-modal sensor dataset:
The SuC shall provide the extrinsic calibration for each sensor。
Rationale: The extrinsic calibration parameters are required to
3
precise overall
calibration.
The SuC shall provide the extrinsic calibration With an accuracy of at least
Cm foreach
translational axis。
Rationale: From the experience of different projects this is a good lower bound. This
measurement accuracy is easily achievable and limits the effort during annotation.
The SuC shall provide the extrinsic calibration with an accuracy of at least 0.2。 for each
rotational axis.
Rationale: From the experience of different projects this is
3
good lower bound。
Rotational inaccuracy leads to an increasing positional error with increasing distance
from the train. This measurement accuracy is easily achievable and limits the effort
during annotation. Calculation for error With 0.2::
10Om
tan(0.2。)
0,35m Which is
already a lot of offset for multi-modal annotation.
The SuC shall provide the intrinsic calibration for each sensor that uses intrinsic calibration
parameters。
Rationale: The intrinsic calibration parameters are required to get a precise overall
calibration.

2.5.5.7
GNSSand IMU Information
The SuC shall provide precise GNSS and IMU information for a specified reference point。
Rationale: The position of the train is required for various use cases. In terms of data
annotation it is required to match the position of the train on the digital map. Precise
IMU information is required to perform egomotion compensation。
GNSS and IMU
information are used to generate metadata to search for specific scenarios such as
the train being at a specific area (geofence), the train drives belowlabovelwithin
3
specific speed or accelerates belowlabovelwith a specific threshold。
The SuC shall provide the GNSS position in WGS84 with the following values and units。

data with the digital
GNSS precision will be limited within tunnels and it shall be
determined if map matched localisation can compensate in those situations or if the
precision can be worse in areas with limited GNSS connection.
2.5.5.8
Ego-Motion Compensation
The SuC shall provide ego-motion compensated or ego-motion compensable sensor data
using the provided Egomotion information。
Rationale: In order to use the sensor data for annotation and object fusion tasks, the
LiDAR point clouds likely
need
to
be ego-motion compensated。 Therefore;
the
information to perform this compensation must be available.

The SuC shall provide the Acquisition_Timestamp for each point within the
cloud.
Rationale: This is often implemented by providing the offset of each point to the
acquisition timestamp
of
the
point cloud。
It
is necessary
to
apply ego-motion
compensation to
clouds and avoid objects that are stretched in driving direction
Of the train.

Perception_Sensor。
Rationale:
In
Order
to
have
an
accurate  egomotion
estimation
for egomotion
compensation of the LiDAR point clouds. The egomotion shall either be measured at
the positions of the LiDARs
Or
measured
at
3
reference position that allows to
calculate the egomotion at the positions of the LiDARs with a comparable precision
by providing the necessary transformation information.
The SuC shall reduce the rolling shutter effect for cameras With a rolling shutter to a minimal
level。
Rationale: The rolling shutter effect introduces distortion (curvature) of objects. This
reduces the precision of sensor fusion and increases the difficulty and effort for data
annotation.
It
also introduces risks for matching objects to the digital
map
and
detecting changes in the environment compared to the digital map。
The SuC shall ensure that the curvature of objects is less than 25
for speeds up to 100 kmlh
compared to the object recorded with a steady train。
Rationale: A big distortion of objects makes it difficult to fuse objects between different
sensors as the appearance and geometries of this objects differ. The example image
(Figure 1
in the document below) shows the effects ofan angle of 4.5。 The distortion
Of the rolling shutter effect is always a trade-off with the exposure time.
It might be
necessary to exceed the distortion limit in situations of low light。

Compliance
Compliance; refers to adhering to laws, regulations, and policies that apply to data. For Data Factory,
this means meeting the requirements of GDPRand other data protection regulations. Compliance
ensures that the Data Factory operates legally and ethically, respecting the privacy and rights of
individuals. Regular auditing and reporting are part of this, ensuring that the system continually
meets these external standards
In order to maintain a suitable balance of interest between data processing entities and data owners,
GDPR implements a negotiation-based approach Which aims at including all relevant interests by
different stakeholder groups into a compromise solution fitting for all of them。
In order to do so in the context of GoA4 development in the rail sector, these groups firstly have to
be identified。

the legitimate interests of
a
railway undertaking
developing GoA4 trains has to be done:
Analysis of people affected: Relevant groups are
rail customers (e.9. on platforms)
rail service employees (in the trackbed or on platforms)
3rd party individuals, e.9. people in the general public being visible while a train passes on a
track next to them. This also refers to e.9. parked cars of which the license plate could be
visible by a camera on the train.
Risk analysis for people affected:
The
data protection
risk for individuals
can generally
be
considered
IOW.
The potential risks associated
with the processing of personal data; such
35
discrimination, identity theft, financial losses, and reputational damage; can be entirely or at least
largely excluded here. Effects of processing the relevant data on the affected individuals are minimal
overall。
From the perspective of the affected individuals, the content and significance of the camera images,
insofaras any personal data can be recognized on them, are minimal in relation to the actual purpose
Of processing these images using algorithms and thus their conversion into a
machine-readable
environmental representation。
This is especially valid for cameras attached to the front of trains because these cover a limited area
surrounding the
Vehicle,
there are
n0
audio recordings
Or live transmissions of the
data
The
recordings are thus limited in scope and functionality to What is necessary for creating environmental
representations, obstacle detection, and collision avoidance.
Access to the stored data must be kept strictly limited to a few authorized individuals and is controlled
with an access authorization concept within the implemented technical and organizational measures
(see below). An identification of individuals in the data is not necessary for GOA4 development and
should thus be excluded during data processing.
Data containing personal content must generally
be deleted after the end ofthe development (achieving the purpose of development). However, some
data might have to be kept for safety auditslsafety argumentation according to the respective norms.
Balance of interests between stakeholders:
Rail customers and people on a platform or other railway areas are usually already subject
to video surveillance
measures to
ensure their safety。
are informed by respective
posters or signs and accept these recordings as a part of their travel. The video surveillance
recordings are mostly long-term recordings, potentially live-viewed and cover the Whole area
of a train station or railway area。
It can thus be concluded that an additional (very shortl)
recording by camera
on a train passing a platform does not constitute a huge change or
additional risk for a customer。
Individuals in the trackbed can be considered employees of a rail company or a contractor
because due to safety requirements, areas around tracks are not public and may not be
accessed by 3rd party individuals. Therefore, the focus on data protection needs here can be
seen with this employeelemployer relationship in mind. It is thus important to integrate all

relevant committees (e.9. workers' council, labour unions etc. ) in the definition of a suitable
data protection process to ensure compliance and acceptance.
While it can e.9. be assumed that persons working in a track bed have an inherent interest
that an automated GoA4 train is able to detect them and brake accordingly, another point in
this discussion could be the employers duty of care to ensure a safe and riskless work
environment. Considering these arguments (and many
more depending on the specific
implementation of a projectl) on the table; it can be assumed that a
suitable solution in
compliance with GDPR
can be
negotiated between the stakeholder groups of a railway
undertaking company。
It
could e.9.
be
3
solution
to only anonymize employees of the
company in certain areas While the data from other areas remains unchanged or to limit the
data usage in other Ways。
However;
these considerations cannot be done generally but only Within the scope of a
specific project and development。
3rd party individuals could be affected by recordings when the train runs close to public areas
such as roads, level crossings etc. It can again be assumed that on the one hand, public area
are often subject to Video surveillance measures and also the recording on-board the train
will most likely only be very short and not capturing a longer trajectory or path of a person。
Also e.9一
license plates visible in public areas are a common thing and are not considered
an additional risk 讦
appear on a video
recording. Limiting access to the data and not
using it for identification of individuals is a natural requirement here Which should not interfere
with the needs for development of a GoA4 train。
On
te
other hand, railway undertakings (and their research
&
development partners)
interested in GoA4 development also have legitimate interests to develop such systems. In
order to extend their business and make it sustainable for the future; they have a legitimate
interest to focus on new technologies and implement them for their business. These needs
can be assumed to be aggravated e.9. by the climate crisis and related interest to focus on
climate-friendly traffic technologies or also by a lack of train drivers that e.9.
DB expects for
the future
The general public is also expected to benefit from the development of GoA4 trains as e.9一
an increased level of service; higher punctuality and
more
advantages are expected with
GOA4 automation of railways as Well as an overall
technology development in Europe Which
is favourable for further future developments. All the aforementioned points are expected to
constitute Very important interests in favour of developing GoA4 technologies。
Expected technicallorganisation measures to be taken according to GDPR: While the exact
measures to be taken for ensuring a suitable balance of interest regarding privacy must be defined
according to a specific project need,
We Want to outline at least a few general remarks in this
document:
Persons affected must be informed about potential video recordings. This can e.9. happen
using respective signs or posters once people enter an area in Which the recording could
take place and must meet the respective GPRD requirements。
Generally, i has to be said that the occurrence of obstacles around rail tracks appears rare
during atrain ride as trains are one ofthe safest measures of transport. The events of interest
during the processing are thus sparse and require larger times of recording, but on the other

hand, much data can also be deleted after processing if it is identified to be less relevant。
Therefore, a suitable selection and prioritization procedure is recommended as it can support
the removal of irrelevant data and only data containing interesting events can be kept。
It should be noted that only a triggerless, indiscriminatory recording enables the recording of
data for detection of obstacles during operation. If the scope is restricted, for example through
anonymization
Or limitation of the range
Or the field of view of the cameras, there is
3
significant risk that the obstacle detection will be limited in its development and later may not
reliably detect people in certain situations and trigger an automated emergency braking.
Anonymization of data is generally not possible。
An anonymization would adversely affect
the training and evaluation of algorithms for the detection and classification of persons and
objects, compromising the achievement of the development goals。
The reasons for this are:
Reduced image quality: Anonymization techniques often involve blurring or pixelating
parts of images containing personal information, Which can affect image quality.
This
impairment can impact the ability of image recognition and object detection algorithms
to
accurately
recognize
and
analyze
visual
features,
leading
to
suboptimal
performance。
Loss of context:
Anonymization techniques
Can
remove
Or
alter context-related
information in images。
Example techniques include removing objects or parts of
objects (e.9., blackening faces)。
Furthermore;
the
environment surrounding
the
objects might also be altered。
This loss of context can affect the ability of image
recognition algorithms to correctly understand and interpret the visual data。
Possible
bias
and generalization problems:
Anonymization
Can
Create
bias that
affects the ability of image recognition algorithms to generalize from training data to
real-world scenarios.
For example; 讦 certain facial features are consistently covered,
the algorithm may struggle to recognize or classify individuals With similarly covered
features。
Replacing personal data is problematic because; for instance; "replacement faces"
must  represent
3
realistic
image
Of
all
recorded
individuals.
This
includes
characteristics such as gender, skin colour, and age. However, evaluating precisely
these
characteristics
requires
processing  special categories
of personal
data
according to Article 9 of the GDPR。
Although
a
general
anonymization
is
not
feasible,
in
the
specific
project
setting,
anonymization should of course be implemented where possible。
Storing of data should be done With the homologation procedure in mind. Although there is
not yet a clear path on homologation of GoA4 systems, it is likely that regulation will require
all data used during the development to be stored for future reference or audits in case of
potential safety issues. The data to be stored for such longer times must be selected carefully
and the process must be accompanied by data protection experts to ensure compliance to
both technical norms and GDPR
With these measures taken and a careful, considerate approach implemented together with close
collaboration by data protection experts and authorities, we conclude that the development of GoA4

2.6.2 System Security Requirements
In the context of the R2DATO project, the security of the system and its datais paramountin ensuring
the integrity and reliability of the Data Factory。
The System Security Requirements are designed to
safeguard both the system and its data against a myriad of threats emanating from the environment。
These threats can be both intentional, such as hacking or theft, and accidental, such as malfunctions
ornatural disasters。
The System Security segment is dedicated to outlining the necessary defences and protocols to
maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system and its data. These elements are
crucial in mitigating the risk of operational disruptions, financial losses, and potential safety impacts
on stakeholders. Our approach is aligned with best practices and standards, including the adoption
of an Information Security Management System (ISMS) in accordance with ISO 27001 [18] and a
risk-based security management strategy guided by ISO 27002 [19] controls。
Furthermore, considering the Data Factory's pivotal role in developing algorithms for future railway
systems;
We integrate security principles from the IEC 62443 [20] standard,
Which focuses
on
industrial automation and control systems。 This section elucidates
our commitment to technical
security measures While assuming operational security is managed by the Data Factory operator,
Who also provides essential security services such as asset management and network security.
The System Security Requirements are structured to address Various aspects Of security, aiming to
ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system and its data。
Here is an overview
of the structure based on the details provided:
2.6.2.1
Technical Security Measures
Identity and Access Management: Ensuring only authorized users can access the system。
Privileged Access Management: Special controls for users with elevated access rights。
Data Confidentiality: Protecting data from unauthorized access and disclosure。
System Integrity: Ensuring data and system functionality are not improperly modified。
System Availability: Ensuring the system is accessible and usable when needed。
System Hardening: Implementing measures to reduce system vulnerabilities。
Asset and Patch Management: Keeping software updated and managing hardware assets。
Backup and Restore: Ensuring data can be recovered in the event of Ioss or corruption.
Logging and Monitoring: Keeping records of system activities for security analysis。

2.6.2.2
General non-functional system security requirements
The following three requirements consider the three primary goals of security confidentiality, integrity
and availability.
The general approach to ensure security within a system is to ensure that a loss of
these goals is avoided based
On a
risk management approach。
Especially that means that
an
acceptable level of risk has to be defined and that all risks do not exceed this risk level。
The Data Factory shall ensure that the risk of a loss of confidentiality is acceptable according to
internal and external regulations。
Confidentiality is one of the primary goals of security and risks have to be acceptable。
The Data Factory shall ensure that the risk of a lost of integrity is acceptable according to internal
and external regulations。
Integrity is one of the primary goals of security and risks have to be acceptable
The Data Factory shall ensure that the risk of a lost of availability is acceptable according to internal
and external regulations。
Availability is one of the primary
of security and risks have to be acceptable
2.6.2.3

Data Transfer and Simulation:
Data Touchpoint: Transfer Data: At this point, the acquired data is offloaded from the
train (vehicle) and transferred into the Data Centre。
The data touchpoint acts as a
gateway, facilitating the data's movement from
the train to the
system's internal
processes。
Simulation Platform: Generate Data for Specific Scenarios: Another way to feed data
into the data factory is via the simulation platform. Using this platform it is possible to
generate synthetic data by executing non-regular situations。
Interconnect Platform: Request Data: Using the Interconnect platform it is possible
to bring additional data into the
Data Factory; but this platform also enables the
exchange (importlexport) of data by connecting other IT systems and data sources。
Data Consolidation and Processing:
Data Platform: Store; Process, and Provide Data: As a central hub, the data platform
receives input from the
actual train
data,
the simulated
data
and the externally
connected data sources. The data is persisted here. The datais also prepared in such
a Way that the required data quality and information is available for the ML models to
be trained
Machine Learning Integration:
ML Platform: Provide Machine Learning Models: The ML platform comes into play by
using the prepared data to make it available for machine learning. Functions are also
provided within the platform to re-train and improve existing ML models. This phase
is crucial for determining the quality and performance of the ML model.
Output:
Trained ML Model: As a result of the ML platform, a specific algorithm or a trained ML
model leaves this platform, Which has been trained and developed for a specific
application。
2.7.1.2
Data Flow Summary
The entire process starts with data acquisition from the train, ensuring a fresh and relevant
dataset。
The Vehicle Data management is conducted through a Vehicle data logger that channels the
data to a touchpoint。
The simulation platform enhances the dataset with Synthetic data, While the interconnect
platform introduces external IT assets into the mix。
The combined streams of real , Synthetic; and external data will be flow at the data platform。
The data is comprehensively prepared and processed on the data platform in order to make
i available for machine learning.
The ML platform is where ML Models and algorithms are provided and trained and re-trained
and making use of the processed data。
The output of the Data Platform is a trained machine learning model that can be tested and
applied to real-world scenarios。

Training machine learning models demands a substantial amount of data. To select the most suitable
data for a given application, efficient data management is indispensable.
The Data Platform delivers
the essential functionalities for this purpose within the Data Factory. These encompass ingesting;
processing, managing, curating, visualising, and annotating data as well as providing data to other
subsystems。
Upon the arrival of new data at the Data Factory, the data ingestion process verifies file integrity
and content, transforming the data into suitable formats for storage. Subsequently, data processing
pipelines are triggered to extract and generate metadata。
This metadata enriches the unstructured
sensor data, making i more manageable and searchable。
Users can explore stored data using a data catalogue and employ queries to find relevant samples
for their
applications:
These samples can then be
organised into datasets for machine learning and
software Validation. The Data Platform also governs data policies and rules that are enforced by the
data curation engine, such as access restrictions, data anonymisation, and data deletion。
Furthermore,
计
facilitates
both
manual
and
automated labelling
Of
Sensor
data
and provides
visualizations alongside annotations. Serving as the central repository for data, the Data Platform
ensures seamless access to its data for other subsystems。

2.7.8 Simulation Platform
Central to the Simulation Platform is the Asset Manager, which ensures that 30 assets are not only
created, updated,and deleted
as necessary but also that their data and integrity
are rigorously
Validated,
and
permissions   strictly
controlled.
This
meticulous
oversight
enables
accurate
representation and consistent quality in the simulation environment。
In parallel, the Scenario Sampler subsystem is engaged in the meticulous preparation, versioning;
archiving, and parameter setting for scenarios。
This process is vital for the development of diverse
and
realistic simulation
scenarios;
Which
are
essential for testing
and   refining
Data Factory
operations。
Moreover, the Generator is the driving force behind synthetic data creation。 It is responsible for
simulating scenarios and recording the resulting synthetic data streams. It also conducts checks and
stores this synthetic data, playing a crucial role in expanding the breadth and depth of data available
for simulations。
To ensure the reliability and accuracy of the simulations, the Validator is tasked with the validation
of both digital twins and 30 assets. This ensures that the simulated environments and objects closely
mirror their real-world counterparts。
Additionally, the Digital Twins Manager oversees the creation and importation of digital twins into the
Simulation
Platform.
This function
is integral
to maintaining
an
updated
and
accurate digital
representation of physical assets within the simulation。
The Simulation Platform's integration with the wider Data Factory environment is pivotal, providing
Critical
data
that feeds
into
the operational decision-making
process; driving innovation,
and
enhancing the overall functionality of the Data Factory.

Sensorindependent attributes (scopes Obiect and Frame)
The requirements defined as children are independent of the sensor modalities. They have to
be assigned with the same attribute value for each sensor modality.
The attributes with scope Object shall be assigned to all annotations of a real-world object and
shall be consistent across all annotations (time and space).
The attributes with scope Frame shall be assigned to all annotations of a real-world object and
Shall be consistent across all annotations within a multi-modal frame.
The scope of each attribute is defined within the attribute's requirement。
