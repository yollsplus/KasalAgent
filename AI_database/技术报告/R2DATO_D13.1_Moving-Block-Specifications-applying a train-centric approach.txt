 Interne  2 INTRODUCTION  
This document introduces the Deliverable 13.1 which consists of three parts corresponding to tasks 
within the work package. Those parts are shortly described below.  
2.1 TASK 13.1:  SYSTEM DEFINITION  
The objective of this Task (13.1) is to define the signalling system, called Moving Block System, in 
particular the system objectives, capabilities, boundaries, functions, operational requirements and 
assumptions in order to cooperate with the Moving Block concept and constitut es the first part of the 
Deliverable 13.1.  
2.2 TASK 13.2:  MOVING BLOCK SPECIFICATION – REQUIREMENTS , ENGINEERING , 
AND OPERATIONAL RULES   
Based on the System Definition the purpose of this task is to analyse the impact of the System Pillar 
on System Requirements and to develop a Moving Block Specification. The work on the Moving 
Block Specification is organized in an iterative and incrementa l fashion in five releases. The first 
three releases are planned for WP13 and releases 4 and 5 are planned for WP14. The contents of 
each release are defined in collaboration with the stakeholders (e.g. prototype developers and the 
demonstrators WP). Each release leads to an intermediate and reviewed version of the Moving Block 
Specification.  
2.3 TASK 13.3:  MOVING BLOCK SAFETY ANALYSIS  
The subject of this task was the safety analysis for the “Moving Block System” (MBS) that has been 
specified in Tasks 13.1 and 13.2.  To move a step beyond what was previously done in S2R (e.g., 
in-depth analysis of relevant operational scenarios) a novel method – called System Theoretic 
Process Analysis (STPA) - was applied to the matter. This STPA focuses on “unsafe control actions” 
in control and feedback loops within complex systems. An advantage over previous methods is the 
potential to identify emerge nt risks stemming from the interaction between those (sub)systems, 
which are often overlooked.

 Interne  WORK PACKAGE GLOSSARY  
Note: Some of those terms are currently also defined in the Glossary of other documents (e.g., 
System Specification, Safety Analysis) of D13.1. Therefore, as long as there is no separate Glossary 
document available, care must be taken to keep the definitio ns synchronised.  
Term  Definition  
Area of Control  The Area of Control  is the topologically limited extent and the 
infrastructural Trackside Assets  in this geographical extent. The term is 
used here for defining the technical and operational responsibility of one 
MBS.  
Domain Data  The Domain Data refers to use case specific configuration data for the 
MBS to define the specific application. These can be broadly classified 
as Map Data, Segment Profiles, and Parameter Data. As a part of 
configuration process, the MBS needs Domain Data.   Potential updates 
of Domain Data will be realised by a centralised provisioning process incl. 
synchronous activation of the new data version.  
Operational Plan  The Operational Plan  is the result of the planning process performed by 
the planning system (TMS). It describes either a planned Operational 
Movement, Operational Restriction or Operational Warning Measure 
through a temporal sequence of Operational Events to be implemented 
by underlying subsystems in the Area of Control . 
Operational State  The Operational State  consists of train -related information (e.g., 
permissions, authorisations or train position) and track -related 
information (e.g., state of Trackside Asset s). 
System Capability  A System Capability  is a service an actor requires from the system to fulfil 
its business goals. System capabilities  are realised by exploiting one or 
multiple functions, usually in a chain of functions. Syst em capabilities  in 
terms of this document are very similar to use cases and the theory 
behind it.  
Train -centric  A train -centric approach from a trackside point of view focuses on the 
train as the true business object. A train object is derived by a train -centric 
signalling system using the currently available sensor information from 
the train and the trackside. This  allows the safety logic of train -centric 
signalling system to operate on the train objects instead on the auxiliary 
information ‘occupancy’ only as today in conventional block -centric 
signalling systems.  
Trackside Asset  Trackside Asset s are elements on or near the track which are used to 
monitor (using sensors) and/or control (using actuators) the movement 
of vehicles through the railway network. to provide a safe route through 
the railway network. They can be switchable or non -switchab le and are 
controlled by the actors Trackside Asset Control and Supervision.

FP2-T13_1 -D-GTD -005-07 Page 7 of 28 06/06/2025  
 
 Interne  Usage Restriction 
Area  A Usage Restriction Area  (URA) limits or constraints operation on a part 
within the Area of Control . URAs can be created according to an 
Operational Plan  (e.g. for enabling construction works) or in response to 
an incident (e.g. as a mitigation measure). There are various limitations 
possible for a URA, e.g. speed restriction , full track closure  or 
deactivate automatic operation .

 Interne  2 SYSTEM OBJECTIVE  
2.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEM UNDER CONSIDERATION  
The Moving Block System (MBS) is based on a train-centric approach using Full Moving block 
principles with the overall objective to engineer high capacity, low cost, high reliability signalling 
systems. The MBS is defined as a single system, without enforcing the conventional separation of 
Radio Blo ck Centre (RBC) and interlocking (IXL). The MBS is based on ETCS cab signalling without 
lineside signals. It uses a more generic and simplified safety logic by abandoning the traditional block 
concept mainly relying on signals.  By emphasising the safety l ogic, the dependency on country 
specific operational processes is reduced.  
The Moving Block System builds on the Functional Railway System Architecture defined by the 
System Pillar and the Moving Block specification defined in Shift2Rail [4] and RCA initiative [3]. 
Depending on the requirements and needs, the MBS can operate with in an environment where TTD 
equipment is installed but also within an environment where TTD equipment is not installed. The 
rationale for considering TTD is to support migration, recovery from degraded situations, and to 
facilitate sensor fusion principles  to foster different localisation inputs.  
2.1.1  System capabilities  
The fundamental objectives of the MBS are to ensure safe train movement and prevent railway 
accidents. They can be split into the following system capabilities:    
• MBS manages communication sessions with Trackside Asset s (TA) via specified interfaces 
within its Area of Control  (AoC).  
• MBS manages communication sessions with trains via specified interfaces within its AoC and 
adjacent areas where trains are supposed to establish or terminate a communication session.  
• MBS controls all TAs within its AoC.  
• MBS manages the current trackside state and determines the state of the track from 
information given during runtime by trains and TAs within its AoC.  
• MBS manages all track path allocations for all trains and vehicles within its AoC. This contains 
an adequate and risk -based protection of requested pieces of track for an intentional train 
movement.  
• MBS issues authorisations for train movements based on requested and accepted track path 
allocations.  
• MBS supervises trains and TAs to prevent railway accidents. This includes especially any 
collision, derailment or over -speeding.  
• MBS stores an up -to-date, reliable and consistent current Operational State  and provides 
this Operational State  to systems connected to MBS.  
• MBS manages Domain Data changes e.g., by introducing new parts of the track.

FP2-T13_1 -D-GTD -005-07 Page 13 of 28 06/06/2025  
 
 Interne  • MBS manages Usage Restriction Areas (URA) and ensures that any URA limitations or 
constraints are considered for operation .  
• MBS handles a safe transition of train movement from and to adjacent systems.  
The system is providing Moving Block operation but it needs to be understood that its application is 
more generic. As it authorises a movement to an arbitrary (operationally sensible) location which 
might or might not be the rear end of the preceding train , it is in its core moving block agnostic, as 
the on -board unit is. Thus, the MBS is capable of supporting fixed block, virtual fixed block and 
moving block operation. It depends on the requesting Plan Execution (PE) system which operation 
is actually perf ormed.  
2.2 LONG TERM OPERATING STRATEGY AND CONDITIONS  
MBS shall offer increased operational flexibility (e.g., by enabling train movements from anywhere 
to anywhere, not using pre -defined paths) allowing for both the minimisation of manual operation by 
the dispatcher/operator and enabling faster recovery from  degraded and emergency situations.  
The long -term operating strategy of the MBS in combination with the interfacing systems revolves 
around a high grade of operational automation. In the case of deviations from normal operation, the 
higher level of automation facilitates the choice of flexib le, operational alternatives as well as the 
reduction of risks associated with human errors by providing improved technical assistance (e.g., for 
construction workers, maintenance staff, operators).  
All in all, MBS should contribute to the increase in capacity by utilising shorter headways enabled by 
the more efficient use of the infrastructure, the use of information of the running trains and the more 
precise occupancy information through the combination of information sources (e.g., axle counters, 
track circuits, Train Position Reports).  
2.3 SYSTEM LIFE -TIME CONSIDERATIONS  
System life -time is understood as system life -cycle within this system definition. MBS is foreseen 
with a modular functional approach. Regarding this approach several life -cycle considerations have 
to be considered:  
MBS life -cycle is independent from life -cycles of surrounding systems. Any changes in PE, Digital 
Register (DR) or Trackside Asset Control and Supervision (TACS) do not affect MBS as long as 
interfaces used are unchanged. Due to generic safety logic, MBS l ife-cycle is independent from life -
cycle of Domain Data  provided by DR. Changes in infrastructure and TAs only affects the Domain 
Data of the  MBS without change the software of the MBS. MBS requirements lifecycle is envisioned 
independent from hardware co mponents and their operating systems.  
The only dependency is given by the MBS functional lifecycle itself.  
2.4 LOGISTIC CONSIDERATIONS  
The MBS  as described within this system definition is not a physical product. At this stage of 
development, logistic considerations are not necessary.

 Interne  3 SYSTEM BOUNDARIES  
This section defines the environment and boundaries of the Moving Block System  (MBS)  by defining 
the interfaces and interactions with other technological systems, the environment, humans and other 
railway duty holders.  
As there is no target CCS reference architecture available yet, this chapter is based on the 
assumptions consolidated in WP13. It is expected that the interfaces or details of the interface is 
subject to change based on the evolvement of the target CCS ref erence architecture.  
An overview is shown in the following figure with the mentioned technological systems, environment, 
humans and other railway duty holders further described in the following subchapters.

 Interne  3.1 INTERFACES AND INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER TECHNOLOGICAL SYSTEM  
This chapter defines the interfaces and interactions between the MBS  and other technological 
systems. For each technological system a description, the cardinality (from one MBS instance) and 
the applicable standard (if any) to be used for the corresponding interface is provided.  
3.1.1  Adjacent System  
Attribute  Content  
Name  Adjacent System  
Description  An Adjacent System can be either radio -based ETCS related neighbouring system 
or a neighbouring system not related to radio -based ETCS.  
A radio -based ETCS related neighbouring system can be either another MBS or a 
neighbouring Radio Block Centre (RBC)  and an IXL . The interface to such a  
neighbouring system allows trains to pass the border to/from a neighbouring Level 
2 area without changing the driver responsibility and the cab -signalling.  
A neighbouring system not related to radio based ETCS is an IXL. The interface to 
such a neighbouring system  allows trains to pass the border to/from an area not 
equipped with Level 2. The cab -signalling is replaced by optical signals.  
Cardinality  n 
Interface  The interface to a radio -based ETCS related neighbouring system is based on the 
existing ETCS specifications [1], namely Subset -039 and Subset -098.  
For the interface to a neighbouring IXL system it is recommended, but not 
mandatory, to use the SCI -ILS interface as published in EULYNX [2].  
Notes:  
- Interfaces to neighbouring IXL systems depend on the supported interface 
capabilities of the IXL and have to be adapted, e.g., by using adapter 
solutions.  
- An interface to an adjacent MBS may also require enhancements to the 
existing ETCS specifications.  
3.1.2  Diagnostics System  
Attribute  Content  
Name  Diagnostics System  
Description  Diagnostics is, as in any system, a fundamental feature. .   
  Contract No. HE – 101102001  
  
 
 
FP2-T13_1 -D-GTD -005-07 Page 16 of 28 06/06/2025  
 
 Interne  Cardinality  1 
Interface  For the target architecture this interface may base on the SDI interface 
specification published in EULYNX [2]. This will be finally defined by the System 
Pillar.  
3.1.3  Digital Register  
Attribute  Content  
Name  Digital Register  
Description  The Digital Register  (DR)  provides reliable (meaning complete, accurate, current, 
and consistent, verified and validated), interoperable and accessible infrastructure 
information as a critical enabler for safety -related and non -safety -related functions. 
The Digital Register includ es static infrastructure information (static speed profile, 
gradients, cant, etc.) and configuration data, which are approved after engineering 
process.  The interface between the D R and the M BS is used to update the data in 
the M BS. 
Cardinality  1 
Interface  The interface between the DR and the MBS is not standardised yet. It will be 
defined in coordination with WP27 considering both the data model and the 
handling of parameter/configuration data as defined by System Pillar Domain 
TCCS (SD1, SD3).  
3.1.4  ETCS on -board  
Attribute  Content  
Name  ETCS on -board  
Description  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board  (OBU)  equipment is a computer -based system that 
supervises the movement of the train to which it belongs, on basis of information 
exchanged with the MBS.  
Cardinality  n 
Interface  The interface to the OBU is based on existing ETCS specifications [1], namely 
Subset -026, Subset -037.  
3.1.5  Operator Panel

FP2-T13_1 -D-GTD -005-07 Page 17 of 28 06/06/2025  
 
 Interne  Name  Operator Panel  
Description  The Operator Panel is used to perform manual interaction with MBS.  
Cardinality  1 
Interface  The interface between the Operator Panel and the MBS is not standardised yet. It 
will be defined considering the principles described in RCA and the work of X2Rail -
5 Moving Block WP.  
3.1.6  Plan Execution  
Attribute  Content  
Name  Plan Execution  
Description  The Plan Execution (PE) requests the setting of field elements and the submission 
of authorisation for train movements e.g., according to Operational Plan  from TMS 
(TMS is out of scope).  
The MBS provides the Operational State  to the PE.  
Cardinality  1 
Interface  The interface between the PE and the MBS is not standardised yet. It will be 
defined considering the principles described in RCA and the work of X2Rail -5 
Moving Block WP.  
3.1.7  Security Service  
Attribute  Content  
Name  Security Service  
Description  The Security Service summarises all technological systems that are necessary to 
manage and provide the cryptographic artefacts (e.g., keys or certificates) to 
ensure the confidentiality, authenticity and integrity (Information Security Triad) of 
the commun ication between  
- the MBS and the OBUs and  
- the MBS and an Adjacent System either being a neighbouring RBC/IXL or 
another MBS and  
- The MBS and the Trackside Assets.

FP2-T13_1 -D-GTD -005-07 Page 18 of 28 06/06/2025  
 
 Interne  Notes:  
- This list is not exhaustive. In future there may be other interfaces which 
require securing the communication using cryptographic artefacts from the 
Security Service.  
- For some interfaces only, a subset of the Information Security Triad is 
applied, e.g., for the communication between MBS and the OBUs it is only 
necessary to ensure the authenticity and integrity.  
Cardinality  1 
Interface  For managing the authentication keys between MBS and OBUs, neighbouring RBC 
or another MBS, the interface to the Security Service is based on the existing 
ETCS specifications [1], namely Subset -114, Subset -137 and Subset -146. 
For managing the cryptographic artefacts between MBS and the Trackside Assets, 
the SSI interface specification as published in EULYNX [2] may be used. This will 
be finally defined by the System Pillar.  
3.1.8  Trackside Asset Control and Supervision  
Attribute  Content  
Name  Trackside Asset Control and Supervision  
Description  The Trackside Asset Control and Supervision (TACS) reports the state of the 
Trackside Asset s (TAs). The MBS mainly uses this interface to trigger setting the 
state of a TA, e.g., moving a point, and to receive status information from TAs (e.g., 
occupancy information from TTD)  
The interface also includes safety relevant maintenance issues, e.g., resetting an 
axle counter.  
Cardinality  n 
Interface  For the target architecture this interface bases on the specification published in 
EULYNX [2]. For migration phase other interfaces, even proprietary ones, are 
possible.  
3.2 INTERFACES AND INTERACTIONS WITH PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT  
The MBS  as described within this system definition is not a physical product. Therefore, at this stage 
of development, no interfaces and interactions with physical environment are necessary.   
The MBS has to be used in a common railways’ environment and therefore the system environmental 
conditions for railways applications as defined by EN50125 and EN50121 have to be considered 
whereas:

FP2-T13_1 -D-GTD -005-07 Page 19 of 28 06/06/2025  
 
 Interne  - the scope of the standards EN50125 covers the definitions and ranges of the following 
parameters: Altitude, temperature, humidity, air movement, rain, snow and hail, ice, solar 
radiation, lightning and pollution and  
- the standard EN50121 describes the characteristics of the railway system which affect 
electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) behaviour.   
3.3 INTERFACES AND INTERACTIONS WITH HUMANS  
The MBS as described within this system definition is not a physical product. Therefore, at this stage 
of development, no interfaces and interactions with humans are necessary and foreseen.  
When using the MBS in a common railways' environment in future, an interface to a Maintenance 
Staff via Diagnostic System may be necessary.  
For test purposes additional interactions with humans may be necessary as required by testing staff, 
e.g., test interfaces, additional data capture needs, etc.  
3.4 INTERFACES AND INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER RAILWAY DUTY HOLDERS  
The MBS  as described within this system definition is not a physical product. Therefore, at this stage 
of development, no interfaces and interactions with other railway duty holders are necessary and 
foreseen. If there are requirements of other duty holders (e.g. , railway undertakings), they will be 
fulfilled using the existing interfaces to the actors as described above.  
When using the MBS in a common railways' environment in future, an interface to other railway duty 
holders may be necessary. This needs to be covered in specific projects.

 Interne  4 SYSTEM FUNCTIONS AND ELEMENTS  
The system functions, derived from the system capabilities in chapter 2.1.1  are outlined in the 
System Specification [6] whereas the System Specification comprehensively defines and elaborates 
on each system function by detailing its purpose, behaviour, inputs, outputs, and any dependencies 
and constraints.

 Interne  5 SCOPE OF OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS INFLUENCING THE 
SYSTEM  
5.1 CONSTRAINTS IMPOSED BY EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE  
The existing infrastructure today has the following characteristics that can impose constraints to the 
system:  
- Wide range of application of baselines and system versions  
- Different application of L1, L1 with infill, L1 with loops, L2 with light signals, L2 only, etc.  
- Highly specialised to fit to "traditional" country -specific rules  
- Implement national laws that are sometimes indirectly related to rail traffic, e.g., laws for 
public roads that affect the use of level crossings  
In conclusion, to avoid Moving Block System (MBS)  dialects (e.g., in ETCS today), operational 
harmonisation is necessary. This would drastically minimise the need for adjustments to MBS on a 
national level.  
Nevertheless, considering that the MBS will be integrated into existing railway infrastructure, MBS 
shall be able to receive necessary information from these legacy systems to be able to ensure safe 
movements inside its Area of Control  (AoC). A major interface that needs to be established is the 
interfaces for adjacent interlockings and RBCs to ensure a safe handover. The integration of legacy 
Traffic Management Systems (TMS), control systems and object controllers have to be analysed a s 
well for migration purposes. Therefore, requirements have to be identified and exported to these 
systems so that adapter solutions can be developed to connect them to MBS. MBS itself shall ideally 
only communicate to another MBS and the systems specified in the target Traffi c CS architecture 
defined by the System Pillar. Legacy systems have to be adapted in order to communicate with MBS.  
Note: The interface for handover to and from a legacy system  (see also chapter 3.1.1 ) is out of scope 
for R2DATO Phase 1 and will thus be excluded in the following subchapters. The scope of R2DATO 
Phase 2 is not yet specified.  
5.2 SYSTEM OPERATING CONDITIONS AND CONSTRAINTS  
 The following operating constrains apply to MBS:  
- Operation with national ATP is not possible  
- No light signalling is supported (with the potential exception of transition areas).  
There are several operating conditions that apply to MBS:  
- MBS supports ETCS Level  2. Flexible migration of fleets concerning the ETCS equipment 
have to be considered, e.g., handling of different ETCS versions, functions and non -equipped 
trains.  
- Trains that deliver their train integrity and safe train length information to MBS as well as 
trains that do not send this information have to be supported.  
- The aim is a minimum or no manual interaction between driver and signaller.  
  Contract No. HE – 101102001  
  
 
 
FP2-T13_1 -D-GTD -005-07 Page 22 of 28 06/06/2025  
 
 Interne  - All movements inside the AoC of MBS are supervised. Furthermore, the logical handling of 
all movements is the same, meaning that there is no distinction between shunting routes and 
train routes anymore. The setting and protection of any kind of train/vehic le movement 
(scheduled or not) is executed with the same set of functions that only change parameters 
according to the intended movement on the track. However, this does not mean, that the 
operational process of shunting (e.g., in the mode SH or SM) will n ot be necessary or is 
planned to be eliminated. Only the technical implementation in MBS is referred to in this 
operational condition.  
- MBS is applicable for different types of railways lines (regional, low density, urban, main line, 
high speed).  
- The loading and activation of Domain Data  to MBS is possible during MBS’ runtime. Thus, 
MBS shall be independent from Domain Data  update and change lifecycles.  
5.3 SYSTEM MAINTENANCE CONDITIONS  
The maintenance strategy provides the use of IT deployment strategies like continuous integration 
based on reliable automatic configuration and test procedures. This enables a faster adaptation of 
the infrastructure to operational needs than today. This in cludes the update of infrastructure data, 
e.g., topology data update without restarting MBS, as well as other configuration data. MBS should 
support the development of easily maintainable solutions e.g., with a feasible degree of modularity, 
thus reducing the maintenance effort for the staff e.g., changing the configuration of the system, 
installing updates, etc.  
Note: The physical aspects of maintenance are out of scope for now, thus e.g., changing of 
hardware, cabling etc. is not considered.  
Regarding the interface with actor Maintenance Staff, the necessity of an HMI has to be analysed 
further during system specification. This interface will exclude some maintenance functionalities like 
the activation of Domain Data  as this is coordinated by the interfacing system Digital Register.  
5.4 LOGISTIC SUPPORT CONSIDERATIONS  
Physical architecture of the system is out of scope. Thus, no considerations about logistic support.  
5.5 REVIEW OF PAST EXPERIENCE DATA FOR SIMILAR SYSTEMS  
The general experience with a substantial subset of today's interlockings (IXL) is that there is no 
standardised interface to it which causes a lot of project engineering and development effort in 
interfacing systems. Oftentimes, the interfacing systems, l ike for example the control system, needs 
detailed knowledge about the behaviour of the IXL to properly command it. Every change of the IXL’s 
baseline leads to changes of all interfacing systems as they have to support new/changed 
functionalities. High coo rdination effort to align the rollout and migration of all the affected railway 
systems, e.g., control system, Radio Block Centre (RBC), TMS and track worker safety systems, is 
needed. This is not only costly and prone to compatibility issues, but also sig nificantly prolongs 
project durations.  
A more specific example is the operation with ETCS. Due to the fact that the OPE TSI has a lot of 
non-harmonised rules, major differences remain in the implementation of the same operational 
processes in different countries. This is due to the freedom of c hoice and application of the trackside 
  Contract No. HE – 101102001  
  
 
 
FP2-T13_1 -D-GTD -005-07 Page 23 of 28 06/06/2025  
 
 Interne  (e.g., whether or not to “stop if in SR” balise, whether or not to apply packet 88, whether or not to 
apply reference balises, the start of mission procedure used). Additionally, differences arise from the 
use of different class B systems. But even if the application of the TSI is chosen (i.e., ETCS), there 
appear to be differences in the implementation and rules of operational processes. Also, this 
“loophole” to use NTC/STM when implementing ETCS ultimately delays the rollout and operation 
with ETCS. An ex ample for this can be seen in the complex integration projects, e.g., for Abellio with 
3 national ATPs and ETCS integrated on -board.   
The integration of ETCS also depends on the used interlocking. For example, when entering an 
occupied track. Today, this is sometimes done in mode OS, sometimes done in SR or even in SH. 
In most cases, the difference is due to differences in the functional ity of the interlocking which is 
used. Also, with relatively modern interlockings, which can support OS, SR or SH is implemented 
nonetheless.  
Note: EULYNX [ 2] is excluded from consideration here because there are no implementations of 
this standard yet in operation.  
5.6 INFLUENCE ON OPERATIONAL AND MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL , PASSENGERS 
AND PUBLIC  
There is no influence on passengers and public expected besides safety by design.  
As the new system MBS needs to be maintained throughout its lifecycle, new maintenance 
procedures and protocols are to be expected. From a hardware perspective, MBS components shall 
be able to run on a new safe computing platform (standardised by the Syste m Pillar). The deployment 
on existing legacy hardware through e.g., emulation, can be analysed in a later specification level.  
The MBS is expected to influence the operational procedures and conditions at least regarding the 
available automated assistance for operational personnel, new procedures for Level 2 operation in 
compliance with the ETCS Specifications  [1] and for entering an occupied track. Therefore, it has to 
be specified how MBS is supporting and managing operation and what is needed on the operational 
side of things. The operational procedures to handle MBS shall not include business “logic” but be 
based on necessary i ssues, not on national particularities/sensitivities.   
Note: The definition of the exact operational procedures is out of scope, because this is within the 
scope of operational harmonisation in the System Pillar.  
In order to use the MBS, training as well as operating manuals have to be provided to the railway 
staff.  
5.7 DESCRIPTION OF OPERATING PROCEDURES  
The operation of MBS requires operating procedures as well as maintenance procedures. Similar to 
EULYNX, there is an “operating mode” and “maintenance mode” of the system envisioned. If the 
system enters “maintenance mode”, procedures for system installati on, loading of new software data 
and configurations can proceed. The maintenance mode as well the start of the procedures can be 
activated either manually by e.g., actor Maintenance Staff, or automatically by an external actor e.g., 
Plan Execution (PE) for  planned maintenance. The transition to the “operating mode” of the system 
is only possible after a successful system test activating the changes made to the system during 
maintenance. Either MBS does the system test autonomously or/and in interaction with  local staff

 Interne  that ensures that no one is endangered by the system activation e.g., by checking and confirming 
that no obstacles are in the area affected by the system update.  
5.8 MODES OF OPERATION  
Modes of operation in the following three major categories according to the TSI OPE  [5] are covered 
by the system:  
- Normal operation  
- Degraded operation  
- Handling of emergency situations  
Several use cases that are part of the listed modes of operation have to be handled by the MBS.  
Firstly, the downgrade from normal situations to degraded situations have to be covered by MBS. 
For this consideration, degraded situations can be defined as “the system with limited functionality”. 
Then, the recovery procedure to normal operation needs to  be handled by MBS, with or without 
interaction with interfacing systems.  
Furthermore, the recovery from emergency situations to operation in degraded situations has to be 
handled by MBS. For example, the loss of train integrity monitoring on -board might trigger an 
emergency reaction first. After the train integrity is assessed once more, the train can continue in 
degraded situations with localisation by Trackside Train Detection (TTD) .  
As a general principle, the handling of degraded situation shall be automated as much as possible. 
This means that the operator shall intervene when a degraded situation can’t be handled by rules 
(interplay between PE and MBS). In order to ensure safety, the human ability to judge and assess a 
situation is needed either by technical means or through legal obligation.

 Interne  6 ASSUMPTIONS AND EXISTING SAFETY MEASURES  
6.1 ASSUMPTIONS  
This chapter contains assumptions related to external systems or actors interacting with the Moving 
Block System  (MBS)  or related to input from external systems that are not covered somewhere else 
yet (e.g., in the corresponding standard).  
Identifier  Allocation  Assumption  
G1 General  Virtual Coupling is out of scope.  
Justification: Virtual Coupling is not part of the Grant Agreement of 
WP1 3.  
T1 Train  If a train is equipped with a TIMS and this trains confirms its train 
integrity, then the MBS can trust the train for:  
- Train Length – Received in Validated Train Data as 
L_TRAIN, which is the maximum length of the train in rear of 
the engine, counted from the front end of the engine 
considering the active cab, and considering the coupling play 
and/or any other uncertainties in the length information . 
- Train Position Reports – including Q_LENGTH, L_TRAININT  
This is consistent with the approach in the ETCS Specifications [1] : 
- On-Board can only confirm Train Integrity to Trackside if the 
train length can be treated as SIL4.  
Justification: This means that the train length and information from 
the train position reports (e.g., train integrity information) can be 
used by the MBS to release track behind the train, and for length 
calculations during splitting and joining.  
Note: This implies that the MBS won’t trust the train for the Train 
Length if the train has never confirmed its train integrity (e.g. 
because the train is not equipped with a TIMS)  
T2 Train  In case of joining or splitting of trains, this causes the external Train 
Integrity Monitoring System (TIMS) devices (in each train) to report 
loss of train integrity.  
As long as MBS has not acknowledged the new train data (incl. train 
length), the train integrity is not confirmed again by the train(s).  
Justification: The safe train length is not valid anymore when trains 
physically join or split.

 Interne  GLOSSARY  
Note: Some of those terms are currently also defined in the Glossary of other documents (e.g., 
System Definition, Safety Analysis) of WP13. Therefore, as long as there is no separate Glossary 
document available, care must be taken to keep the definitions s ynchronised.  
Term  Definition  
Allocation Section  Allocation Section s express  gauge clearance conflicts between different 
tracks.  
For example, Allocation Sections  are associated to the representation of 
switchable Track Assets and further track connections like diamond 
crossings.  
The Allocation Sections  are used in terms of granting a Movement 
Permission request as condition for clearance in a certain area.  
 
See also /FlankProtection/  
Area of Control (AoC)  The Area of Control is the topologically limited extent used here for 
defining the technical and operational responsibility of one instance of 
MBS.  
Domain Data  The Domain Data  refers to use case specific configuration data for the 
MBS to define the specific application. These can be broadly classified 
as Map Data, Segment Profiles, and Parameter Data. As a part of 
configuration process, the MBS needs Domain Data . Potential updates 
of Domain Data  will be realised by a centralised provisioning process incl. 
synchronous activation of the new data version.  
Source: /SD1DM/  
Domain Object  A Domain Object  is an abstract object for which a Domain (e.g. Moving 
Block System) has the main responsibility. There might be other Domains 
who are consumers of this object as well. In general, it is based on or 
linked to the Domain Data . 
Drive Protection 
Section (DPS)  A Drive Protection Section  is a linear contiguous stretch of track with a 
driveability (passage possible yes/no) state.  
 
A Drive Protection Section  (DPS) represents a Track Edge Section  that 
can be brought to different driveability states to ensure the driveability or 
safety of a track route. As such, it is an abstraction for any location on the 
railway network that may adopt different states due to Switchable 
Trackside Asset (e.g. point s or level crossings).

 Interne  MBS Operational 
State  MBS Operational State  is the collection of all of Domain Objects  
instantiated by the MBS to manage its operations and supervise the train 
movements.  
This includes:  
• Train Objects,  
• Unresolved Trackbound Objects,  
• Trackside Asset Objects,  
• Movement Permission,  
• Etc...  
MBS is operational  MBS is operational  when it is in a state allowing the MBS to perform its 
fundamental function ensuring safe train movement and preventing 
railway accidents, incidents... From now on, communication sessions to 
the external systems (e.g., OBU, PE, etc.) can be established and  
supervised.  
Movement Permission  The Movement Permission defines the part of the track that is reserved 
for the movement of a train.  
It includes:  
- Movement Permission Extent  
- Risk Buffer  
- Risk Path  
- Requested Maximum Speed  
- ETCS Movement Mode  
- List of DPS Groups that must not be used as flank protection measure  
Movement Permission 
Extent  A Movement Permission Extent  is a linear contiguous stretch of track that 
is reserved for the movement of a train. The Movement Permission  is 
translated to an authorisation (e.g. Movement Authority) according to the  
/ETCS/  - SUBSET -026 that is transmitted to the train.  
The Movement Permission Extent is part of the Movement Permission.  
Source: RCA  
Non-switchable 
Trackside Asset  A Non-switchable Trackside Asse t is a Trackside Asset which provides 
information to the MBS (e.g. Trackside Train Detection ) but cannot be 
controlled to a particular state.  
Position is ambiguous  The position information contained in a Train Position Report (Position 
Report or SoM Position Report with status valid) can be considered as 
ambiguous in case MBS is not able to safely locate the train within the 
track layout. Since the Train Position Rep ort only contains a (directed) 
distance to the LRBG, MBS might not be able to locate the train on the 
correct position in the track layout, e.g. in case of a zig -zag movement

 Interne  (see Hazard 0003 in /ETCS/  - SUBSET -113) or when there is a facing 
pair of points between the LRBG and the position of the train.  
Risk Buffer  The Risk Buffer  is a linear contiguous stretch of track that serves as the 
overrun protection and in the event of a rollback of a chased train. It is 
part of a Movement Permission . 
A Risk Buffer  exists if there is a Danger Point or a safe margin (project 
specific) greater than zero.  
Source: RCA  
Risk Path  A Risk Path  is one potential path (a linear contiguous stretch of track) by 
which a non -permitted vehicle movement could result in a flank collision 
with a vehicle moving along the Movement Permission Extent . 
A Movement Permission can contain zero or more Risk Paths . 
Source: RCA  
Switchable Trackside 
Asset  A Switchable Trackside Asset  is a Trackside Asset  which enables (e.g. 
points, derailers, movable bridges, gates) or allows (e.g. light signals at 
border, level crossings) the continuation of movement beyond this asset 
when this latter is controlled to particular state.  
Topology Data  See entry for Domain Data  
Track Edge (TE)  Track Edge  is a linear object that defines an uninterrupted stretch of a 
railway track without divergence or convergence. A Track Edge  is defined 
along the centre line of the 2D or 3D track alignment and has a finite 
length.  
The Track Edges  have an implicit direction (from start to end).  
The start/end of Track Edge  shall correspond to the location of a simple 
point, or any form of end of track.  
Source: RCA, /SD1DM/  
Track Edge Point 
(TEP)  A Track Edge Point is a spot location on a Track Edge . 
Example usage: balise location  
Source: RCA, /SD1DM/  
Track Edge Section 
(TES)  A Track Edge Section  is a linear extent between two Track Edge Point s 
on (the same) Track Edge  and can be directed.  
Example usage: Track properties like gradient, SSP, DPS

 Interne  Trackside Asset (TA))  Trackside Asset s are elements on or near the track which are used to 
monitor (using sensors) and/or control (using actuators) the movement of 
vehicles through the railway network. They can be switchable or non -
switchable and are controlled by the actors  Trackside Asset Control and 
Supervision  (TACS).  
See also Switchable Trackside Asse t and Non-switchable Trackside 
Asset  definition.  
Trackside Asset 
Control and 
Supervision (TACS)  The Trackside Asset Control and Supervision  (TACS) is a subsystem 
supervising and controlling Trackside Asset s. 
Trackside Train 
Detection (Section)  Trackside Train Detection is a system which determines the occupancy 
status of TTD sections. TTD section may be a Track Circuit or an Axle 
Counting system.  
EULYNX synonym: Track Vacancy Proving Section (TVPS)  
Train Location  Train Location  is the MBS interpretation of the unambiguous location of 
the train, based on Train Position Reports, Validated Train Data and other 
inputs if available, e.g. TTD. Train Location  is a linear contiguous stretch 
of track that has a front and a rear.  
X2R5 source: Train Location  
RCA source: rMOB extent  
Train Object  Train Object  is the object needed by the MBS to manage the connected 
trains currently performing their mission.  
Note: This Train Object  could nevertheless correspond to a train not (yet) 
localised by MBS.  
If a Train Object is referenced as a geometric extent, the extent is the 
extent of the Train Location.  
RCA source: (rMOB)  
Train Position Report  The term Train Position Report  refers to either Position Report packet 
(packet number 0) or Position Report based on two balise groups packet 
(packet number 1) according to /ETCS/  - SUBSET -026, chapter 7 .  
Unresolved 
Trackbound Object  Unresolved Trackbound Object is the  object needed by the MBS to 
manage a contiguous track area where track vacancy is not proven and 
cannot be linked to any connected train ( Train Object ).

 Interne  1 INTRODUCTION  
The task 13.2 “Moving Block Specification – Requirements, engineering and operational rules” within 
the WP13 of the project FP2 – R2DATO has got the objective to develop a Moving Block 
Specification.  
As a result of this task, the present document specifies the Moving Block System, as firstly defined 
in the Moving Block System Definition (document /SysDef/ ). 
This specification focuses on the functional requirements. Non -functional requirements are 
considered in a later release of this document . 
This document is related to the following work packages:  
- WP13: Task 13.3: Moving Block Safety Analysis  
- WP14: Moving Block ETCS Level 3 – Prototype development & Analysis  
- WP44 -45: Moving Block ETCS L3 Demonstrator – Specification

2 SCOPE OF WORK  
The scope of release 3 of the System Specification is limited as follows1: 
Capability:  
• Start up the system  
• Load Domain Data  at start -up  
• Control the Trackside Assets  (SCI-P only)  
• Establish, maintain and terminate communication session with Trackside Asset s 
• Manage track path allocation ( including Release allocated portion of track path which has 
been passed by the train and Release allocated portion of track in front of the train ) 
• Manage authorisations for train movement (Movement Authority, Request to Shorten MA ) 
• Manage the current trackside state and determine the state of the track from information 
given during runtime by trains and Trackside Asset s within its Area of Control  
• Store an up -to-date, reliable and consistent MBS Operational State  and provide this to 
consuming systems (PE only)  
• Establish, maintain and terminate communication session with OBU  
Interface with  
• Trackside Assets  (SCI-P and SCI -TDS) via Trackside Asset Control and Supervision  (TACS) 
instances  
• Plan Execution (PE)  
• ETCS On -board (OBU)  
• Digital Register (DR)  
The following needs are covered:  
• Flank Protection  
• Splitting, joining, turning (with/without Cold Movement Detection)  
• DPS Group  
• Propagation of UTOs  
• Train length (L_TRAIN) reliability  
All other interfacing systems according to /SysDef/  are out of scope for this release.  
For Trackside Asset , only SCI -P and TTD sections are considered.

 Interne  (Degraded) operational scenarios are not defined/analysed/covered (e.g. odometry issues, reset of 
axle counters, etc…)  
Override is out of scope  
Only the ETCS modes SB, FS, OS are covered inside the AoC.  
Transitions (from/to adjacent interlockings, RBC, and MBS) are out of scope.  
2.1 GENERAL LIMITATIONS  
This chapter contains general limitations that are valid for all releases of the System Specification.  
- Disclaimer: this specif ication is not yet part of a complete safety analysis.  
- As the System Specification also contains the functionality of an RBC, the MBS shall be able 
to perform all the functions of the RBC Basic Interoperability Constituent (IC). Instead of 
repeating the /ETCS/, this document focuses on the essential functions of the MBS rather 
than specifying each function in detail of the RBC functionality.  
- This System Specification does not explicitly specify the rules to provide national values, 
position report parameters and MA request parameters to the OBU. This depends on e.g. 
the operational rules and therefore is assumed to be application specific.  
- This System Specification focus on functional requirements.  
- The swinging overlaps are currently not supported  (see REQ -SC_DPS_RB ). 
- The System Version 2.1 of /ETCS/  is only supported by the MBS.  
o Justification: This System Specification is used by the demonstrators using OBUs. 
But there are no OBUs available yet supporting a newer System Version than 2.1. In 
later editions of the System Specification newer System Versions will be supported.  
- This System Specification does not explicitly specify how the cryptographic artefacts (e.g. 
KMACS) for the communication between MBS and the trains are made known to the MBS.  
Justification: According to chapter 2 this interface is out of scope of this System Specification.

 Interne  3 APPROACH AND METHODOLOGY  
The Moving Block System specification is developed according to the following inputs sources:  
• Moving Block System Definition (ref. /SysDef/ ), which  
o defines the System capabilities to be performed.   
o defines the external actors and the interfaces (System Boundaries).  
• The EULYNX Standard (ref. /EULYNX/ ) 
It is used for the interface with the Trackside Asset  (I_TACS interface, see chapter 7.1) 
• The CCS TSI (ref.  /CCSTSI/ ),  
o for the ETCS concepts and functionality  
o for the interface with OBU (I_OBU interface, see chapter 7.3)  
o for the interface with adjacent system (I_AS interface, see chapter in a later release)  
o for the interface with Security Service (I_SEC interface, see chapter in a later release)  
• RCA (ref. /RCA/ ) 
• Shift2Rail Moving Block (ref. /S2R/ )   
• System Pillar – Global system architecture – input expected for a further release  
• System Pillar – Operational scenario – input expected for a further release  
• System Pillar – OpCon Operational Vision (ref.  /OpCon/ ) 
• System Pillar TCCS SD1 Data Model (ref. /SD1DM/ ) for the Domain objects  description  
• Requirement writing (ref. /SempR2/  and /SempR3/ ) 
• Alignment with the Demonstrator Work Packages FP2 -WP44 and FP2 -WP45  
• Alignment with the Digital Register Work Package FP2 -WP27  
• Alignment with the Plan Execution Work Package FP1 -WP17  
• Approved list and description of operational scenarios which have to be covered by the 
System Specification.  
o Note: As long as there are no operational scenarios available from System Pillar 
Operational Design Domain, the work bases on the operational scenarios to be 
covered by the Moving Block Demonstrator (WP44).  
The goal of the System Specification is the derivation of the System Requirements from the System 
Capabilities.  
The approach to derive the System Requirements for the MBS is as follows:  
Step Description  Chapter  
1 The main concepts of /RCA/  and /S2R/  are evaluated and 
consolidated. Afterwards the consolidated concepts are 
described in detail in separate concept papers to be able to apply none

FP2-T13_2 -D-ALS-003-10 Page 24 of 197 07/07/2025  
 
 Interne  it later for the specification of the System Requirements. A 
justification is provided for each of the consolidated concepts.  
2 Then the System Capabilities (as listed in the /SysDef/ ) related to 
the operational scenarios are detailed. Afterwards this detailing is 
used to derive sequence diagrams depicting the interactions of 
the MBS with neighbouring systems connected to it. The 
sequence diagrams are additionally utilised to derive th e 
necessary System Functions. The same System Function may 
be used by several capabilities or scenarios.  Chapter 5 
3 Subsequently the derived System Functions are described and 
the specific requirements for them are listed considering the 
consolidated concepts (in step 1), if applicable.  Chapter 6 
4 Based on the scenarios, the interface needs (e.g., messages, 
etc.) are described considering existing standards and the 
concepts, if applicable.  Chapter 7

 Interne  4 MBS OVERVIEW  
An overview of the environment and boundaries of the Moving Block System (MBS) is shown in the 
following figure with the mentioned technological systems, environment, humans and other railway 
duty holders.  
 
Figure 1 – System Boundaries   
Note: The interface to the Operator Panel, amongst others, is not standardised yet and has to be 
defined. The Figure 1 considers two options. As this design decision is not clear yet, this is 
highlighted in red.

 Interne  5 SYSTEM CAPABILITIES SPECIFICATION  
This chapter further details the system capabilities defined in /SysDef/ . 
The following table provides a mapping from the system capabilities listed in /SysDef/ to the system 
capabilities detailed in this System Specification.  
System Capability as listed in /SysDef/  Chapter(s) in System Specification  
MBS manages communication sessions with 
Trackside Asset s (TA) via specified interfaces 
within its Area of Control  (AoC).  5.6 SysC: Start communication with one TACS  
MBS manages communication sessions with 
trains via specified interfaces within its AoC and 
adjacent areas where trains are supposed to 
establish or terminate a communication 
session.  5.7 SysC: Respond to initiation of 
communication session by OBU  
5.14 SysC: Terminate Train Mission  
MBS controls all TAs within its AoC.  
 5.8 SysC: Control Switchable Trackside Assets  
MBS manages the current trackside state and 
determines the state of the track from 
information given during runtime by trains and 
TAs within its AoC.  5.12 SysC: Start of Train  
5.10  SysC: Update MBS Operational State  
5.14 SysC: Terminate Train Mission  
MBS manages all track path allocations for all 
trains and vehicles within its AoC. This contains 
an adequate and risk -based protection of 
requested pieces of track for an intentional train 
movement.  5.13 SysC: Provide MA to Train  
MBS issues authorisations for train movements 
based on requested and accepted track path 
allocations.  5.13 SysC: Provide MA to Train  
MBS supervises trains and TAs to prevent 
railway accidents. This includes especially any 
collision, derailment or over -speeding.  Out of scope for current releases  
MBS stores an up -to-date, reliable and 
consistent current Operational State  and 
provides this Operational State to systems 
connected to MBS.   5.10  SysC: Update MBS Operational State  
5.11 SysC: Report MBS Operational State  
MBS manages Domain Data changes (e.g., by 
introducing new parts and/or changes of the 
track)  5.2 SysC: Preload Topology Data  
5.3 SysC: Approve Topology Data activation

 Interne  MBS handles a safe transition of train 
movement from and to adjacent systems.   Out of scope for current releases  
Different scenarios outlining the MBS behaviour are defined for each capability.  
Please refer to “Annex 2: Template” for explanation of the following capability tables and sequence 
diagrams.  
5.1 SYSC: START AND MAINTAIN MBS  
5.1.1  Communication patterns  
MBS has communication sessions to its actors according to the following list. For every actor it is 
described why there is the initiator/responder role:  
(MBS as session initiator)  
• DR: DR is a service which provides topology data to its clients. It therefore acts in a server 
role which means that clients (like MBS ) establish the communication to the server.  
• TACS : Defined by EULYNX, the interlocking (here: MBS ) is responsible to initiate the 
communication.  
(MBS as session initiation responder)  
• PE: MBS  is a service to PE which serves requests to set Switchable Trackside Asset s and 
grant Movement Permission s. MBS  therefore acts in a server role which means that PE 
establishes the communication to the server ( MBS ). 
• OBU : It initiates the communication as MBS  won’t know all trains in its area until they connect 
(/ETCS/  - SUBSET -026 §3.5.3.4 of /ETCS/).  
MBS also supervises the communication  so it can react to a loss of communication.  
If MBS is the session initiator, it means whenever a supervision function of MBS  detects that there 
is no communication, it establishes a communication (which might be the very first establishment at 
start of MBS or a re -establishment after a communication loss):

 Interne  The <actor>CommEstablished event can be used to trigger further scenarios like the synchronisation 
of TACS in case of <actor> == TACS or initialisation of a related state.  
The <actor>CommLost event can be used to trigger further scenarios like setting (a) related Domain 
Object (s) to the safe state.  
 
With this, MBS  can react independently on the raised internal events:

 Interne  5.1.2  Capability  
The named communication pattern is applied to MBS  in order to supervise communication to actors 
((re-)establish/maintain communication).  
Table 1 – Description of SysC: Start and Maintain MBS  
Description  This capability allows to start and maintain MBS  communication to actors.  
Goal  MBS is operational  
Precondition(s)  None  
Postcondition(s) 
(Success)  The Moving Block System has been started and is operational.  
Postcondition(s)  
(Failure)  The Moving Block System is not operational.  
Involved actor(s)  DR, PE, OBU, TACS  
Trigger(s)  MBS is started  
Main Sequence  1. MBS supervises the communication to actors  
(This is done in a continuous loop.)  
Alternate Sequence  None  
Failure Sequence  Only for release 2..4:  
1. If loading or checking the Topology Data  fails, the start procedure 
terminates.  
Comments  MBS could either be started by an external event or automatically when 
recovering from a failure for example.  
The communication patterns raise events <actor>CommEstablished  and 
<actor>CommLost  for every actor <actor> (UML: lost message ). Other capabilities 
can react (UML: found message ) to these events and react accordingly (e.g. 
initialising a safe state).

 Interne  5.2 SYSC: PRELOAD TOPOLOGY DATA 
Description  This capability allows to provide MBS  with Topology Data initially. This finally 
results into topology -related Domain Object s 
Goal  MBS  has loaded (initial or new version of) Topology Data  and related Domain 
Objects  
Precondition(s)  No Topology Data  available (no Topology Data  loaded) at startup  
Postcondition(s) 
(Success)  Up to release 4:  
MBS  has loaded, approved, and activated Topology Data  
MBS is operational 0 
 From release 5 on (more granular steps so this capability only does preloading):  
MBS  has loaded Topology Data  
MBS is operational 0 
Postcondition(s)  
(Failure)  MBS  state related to Topology Data  has not changed  
MBS is not operational 0 
Involved actor(s)  DR 
Trigger(s)  1. MBS starts up  
2. (For further release) MBS  receives the Topology Data  from DR 
Main Sequence  Up to release 4:  
1. MBS  establishes a communication session with DR. 
2. MBS requests Topology Data  from DR 
3. MBS receives Topology Data  and activates them  
From release 5 on:  
1. MBS  establishes a communication session with DR. 
2. MBS  requests Topology Data  from DR 
3. MBS  receives Topology Data  and pre -loads them.  
4. MBS  approves the activation of Topology Data  
5. MBS  activates Topology Data   
Alternate Sequence  From release 5 on:  
At any point in time, DR can send Topology Data  to MBS  (continues then from 3. 
on) 
Failure Sequence  4. MBS rejects the approval when there are e.g. conflicting Movement Permission s 
(for further release)  
Comments  Before release 5, there are the following restrictions  
• The scope of Topology Data  is the full Area of Control  (so no partial 
update)  
• Topology Data  are loaded only once at startup and remain unchanged (so 
no update during run -time)  
• It is assumed that neither connecting to DR, nor loading the Topology Data  
from there fails (exclusion of unhappy paths)  
 
The scenario will thus widen in a later release: data are not only loaded and 
immediately activated, but pre -loaded, approved, and activated. In order to save 
work already knowing the future state, the function to load  Topology Data  is 
already named ‘preload’ and not only ‘load’. The term ‘preloaded’ can be read as 
‘loaded’.

Table 2 – Description of SysC: Respond to initiation of communication session by PE  
Description  This capability responds to the communication session establishment by PE.  
 
This communication session is crucial to e.g., be able to receive requests for 
Movement Permissions for trains. After the communication session is established, 
the MBS distributes its MBS Operational State  (e.g., state of Trackside Assets ) to 
PE.  
Goal  MBS  has distributed its MBS Operational State  to PE.

5.6.1  Scenario: Start communication session with a TACS  
 
Figure 7 - Scenario: Start communication session with a TACS  
 
The capability “Establish communication session with  a TACS” is responsible for establishing a 
communication session with a TACS. Generally, when MBS detects that there is no communication 
session with the TACS, the MBS shall establish a communication ses sion with a TACS. This 
capability is not further detailed in this chapter. Instead the details are described in chapter 7.1 of 
this document.  
5.7 SYSC: RESPOND TO INITIATION OF COMMUNICATION SESSION BY OBU

Main Sequence    1. MBS sets -up a safe radio connection and communication session 
according to /ETCS/  considering using System Version 2.1.  
MBS creates a Train Object  for this OBU and subsequently informs PE 
about this through the capability ‘Update MBS Operational State ’.  
Alternate Sequence    None.  
Failure Sequence    1. If a condition to establish a safe connection or communication 
session is not fulfilled, then MBS ends the procedure to set -up a safe 
radio connection and communication session by terminating the safe 
connection, if any.  
Comments    The failure sequence may be triggered e.g. in the following case :

5.8.1  Scenario: Control Switchable Trackside Assets  
The figure below contains the main sequence and the failure sequence of the SysC Control 
Switchable Trackside Asset . 
When the MBS receives a TA State Request, it performs the safety checks (Function: Authorise TA 
State Request) for the request.  
If the safety checks are successful, MBS responds to PE the granting of the request and translates 
the request to a TACS command (Function: Translate TA State Request to TACS Command). The 
TACS command is then sent to the related TACS (Function: Send TACS Command).  
If the safety checks fail, MBS responds to PE system the rejecting of the request and performs no 
further actions for the request.

depend on the operational procedures which are not available yet.   
5.12.1  Scenario: Start of Train  
Please consider that during this scenario after each Train Position Report (packet number 0 or 
packet number 1), respectively after receiving the SoM Position Report, MBS updates the Train 
Object  by the capability “Update MBS Operational State ” and reports this to the PE. This handling of 
Train Position Reports is not explicitly illustrated in the figure to limit the sequence diagram to the 
Start of Train capability.  
During this scenario, after the acknowledgment of Train Data, it is possible (when the OBU is 
equipped with a TIMS) that the MBS receives the first Train Position Report with integrity confirmed.

 Interne  5.15 SYSC: REVOKE MA COOPERATIVELY BY PE 
Description  The purpose of this capability is to perform a co -operative shortening 
of MA, applying the principles of /ETCS/  - SUBSET -026, chapter 3.8.6 
(/ETCS/ ). This may be necessary for the operational scenarios “Joining” 
or to reschedule train movements.  
Goal  After receiving a cooperative shortening request  indicating that it is 
requested to cooperatively shorten the MA from PE, MBS checks all 
safety constraints and subsequently performs the cooperative 
shortening of MA with the OBU.  
Precondition  None  
Postcondition (Success)  After the OBU has accepted the new MA and has informed MBS about 
this, the MBS has updated the Movement Permission and informs PE 
about the success of the cooperative shortening of MA procedure.  
Postcondition  
(Failure)  Failure 1:  
After the OBU has rejected the new MA and has informed MBS about 
this, the MBS informs PE about the failure of the cooperative 
shortening of MA procedure.  
The previously received MA remains valid on -board.  
Failure 2:  
The MBS has rejected the Cooperative Shortening Request.  
Involved Actors  • OBU  
• PE 
Trigger  • MBS receives a Cooperative Shortening  Request from PE indicating 
that it is requested to co -operatively shorten the MA.  
Main Sequence  1. When all checks are successful, then MBS indicates this to PE and 
subsequently sends a Request to Shorten MA message to the OBU 
based on the Cooperative Shortening Request received from PE.  
2. When MBS receives the Request to shorten MA is granted message 
from the OBU, then MBS indicates this to the PE. Subsequently the 
Train Object  (including the Movement Permission) is updated and 
PE is also informed about that.   
Alternate Sequence  None  
 
Failure Sequence  1.a) When at least one check is not successful, then the MBS indicates 
this to PE. The co -operative shortening of MA procedure is aborted.  
2.a) When MBS receives the Request to shorten MA rejected message 
from the OBU, then MBS indicates this to PE. The co -operative 
shortening of MA procedure is finished.

REQ -0029  FOR FURTHER RELEASE  [X2R5 REQ -TrackInit -2] 
The MBS shall utilise valid Stored Information to enable faster initialisation.  
Rationale:  
Historic information on the state of the railway from before the MBS was restarted can 
enhance the Initialisation process.  
Guidance:  
The location of all trains in communication prior to the restart, along with the extent of 
any MAs issued will be valuable information to be utilised.  
The validity of the information used must be carefully considered, as if the MBS has 
been offline for some time the State of the Railway is likely to have changed.  
Criteria for considering Stored information as valid are project dependent e.g. during 
MBS Initialisation, if the time passed is smaller than a configured value.

The MBS shall, if configured, provide a means for the person responsible for the MBS 
Initialisation to confirm that the procedure is completed.  
Rationale:  
If Stored Information is not valid, the person in charge of initialising the MBS has to 
confirm when the procedure is completed. They have the authority to confirm that all 
the obstacles on the railway are known to the MBS.  
Guidance:  
If Stored information is used to initialise the MBS, this confirmation is not needed and 
it is project specific to implement it.

6.8.1  Overview  
When MBS has successfully established a communication session with an OBU, then a Train Object  
for this OBU is established in the MBS. This Train Object  subsequently covers all train -related 
information (e.g. Train Data, Train Location , etc.) as soon as this information is available.

Rationale:  
This ensures that MBS has an up -to-date image of all train -related information. Most 
recent Train Position report information is used to e.g. store detailed position 
information (e.g. mSFE).

 Interne  6.9 SYSF LOCALISE TRAIN  
6.9.1  Overview  
This function localises a communicating train within the Area of Control. The Train Location  
information is stored in the Train Object .  
Within the MBS, the Train Location  for a train is the MBS interpretation of the location of the train, 
based on Train Position Reports, Validated Train Data and other inputs if available, e.g. TTD 
sections.  
A Train Location  has a front and a rear:  
The front of the Train Location  is the MBS view of the furthest position for the front of the train, 
based on Train Position Reports and other inputs, e.g. TTD sections.  
The rear of the Train Location  is the MBS view of the furthest position for the rear of the train, 
based on Train Position Reports, Validated Train Data, and other inputs, e.g. TTDs.  
The different terms used within this section to determine a Train Location  are summarised in Figure

 Interne  6.9.4  General Train Location  Requirements  
REQ -0063   
To create or move a Train Location , the MBS shall perform the requirements sequentially 
in the order they are found in Table 10. 
Rationale:    For example, the position report requires the updating of the train 
front location prior the updating of the train rear location.  Once the Train Location  
has been updated by the position report, it can be updated again by the clear TTD.  
Guidance:    None  
Operational Rules:  None  
Engineering Rules:  None  
 
 
6.9.5  Requirements to create a Train Location  
REQ -TrainLoc -5    
The MBS shall create a Train Location for the Train Object  from the Min Safe Front End 
to the Max Safe Front End derived from the Train Position Report  if the following 
conditions are fulfilled:  
• Train Position Report from a n OBU  where the reported position is unambiguous to 
the MBS  is received, AND  
• there is no Train Location  for this OBU, AND  
• mode is different from SB  
Rationale:  
This is to enable the MBS to record the Train Location  of all communicating trains in 
the Area of Control.  
Guidance:  
The MBS will need to create a new Train Location : 
• For an OBU which has started a communication session within the Area of 
Control, but which is not performing Start of Mission.  
• For an OBU which has entered the Area of Control.  
For a train which has started a communication session within the Area of Control, but 
which is not performing Start of Mission, the new Train Location  will be from Max Safe 
Front End to Min Safe Front End, as there will be no train length provided yet.  
  Contract No. HE – 101102001  
  
 
 
FP2-T13_2 -D-ALS-003-10 Page 78 of 197 07/07/2025  
 
 Interne  For a train which has entered the Area of Control, and which has not confirmed Train 
Integrity, the new Train Location  will be at least from the Max Safe Front End to the 
border of the Area of Control. This applies to both Handovers and Transitions.  
How and when the first Train Location  is established at the border to an Area of Control 
is project specific.  
Note: When Train Data message is received for a train not yet localised (i.e. without 
existing Train Location ), the Train Location  is created for the front of the train due to 
the Train Position Report contained in this message. The train rear is afterwards 
localised using the Train Length (L_TRAIN) contained in the Train Data message (see 
REQ -TrainLoc -6). 
Operational Rules:  None  
Engineering Rules:  None  
REQ -TrainLoc -4    
When receiving a Start of Mission Train Position Report which status is valid from a train 
where the reported position is unambiguous to the MBS, the MBS shall create a Train 
Location  for that Train Object  from the Min Safe Front End to the Max Safe Front End 
derived from the Train Position Report.  
Rationale:  
For a train which has a new connection to the MBS, the MBS must create a new Train 
Location  for the reported position.  
Guidance:  
At Start of Mission, before the receipt of Validated Train Data, only the Estimated Front 
End and its Confidence Interval are known to the MBS. The Train Location  is then only 
from Max Safe Front End to Min Safe Front End, as shown in Figure 22. 
 
Figure 22: Train Location  from Start of Mission Train Position Report  
In Figure 22, the Train Object  is shown with Train Integrity not confirmed. Train integrity 
cannot be confirmed until Validated Train Data has been acknowledged by the MBS.  
How a Train Location  which is partially outside the Area of Control is processed will be 
project specific.

The TMS shall provide means for a Signaller to assign a position to a train that is reporting 
a position during Start of Mission which is unknown or invalid, or a position which the 
MBS considers ambiguous.  
Rationale:  
This is to allow the MBS to locate a train in its Area of Control after a specific 
operational procedure.  
Guidance:  
How the Signaller enters the position of a train in the TMS is project specific, but the 
MBS cannot accept a position in a clear area of track.  
The Signaller may need to contact the Driver to determine an estimated location for 
the train.

Safe Front End derived from the Train Position Report  
Rationale:  
The MBS uses the information in Train Position Reports to update the Train Location  
of trains in its area.  
Guidance:  
The front of the Train Location  for a train can be updated with every position report 
received, including trains in RV mode,  if the position is known to the MBS.

Length.  
Rationale:  
The receipt of a new value of Train Length in Validated Train Data represents new 
information from the train, which must be used to update the Train Location . 
Guidance:  
The only information used from the Validated Train Data to determine Train Location  
is the train length (L_TRAIN).  
A new value of L_TRAIN means either the first value received since the Train Location  
was created, or a changed value received at some later time.  
If this is the first value for L_TRAIN received since the Train Location  was created, 
then the Train Location  is extended as shown in Figure 25.

 Interne  6.9.7  Reaction to Unexpected Train Locations  – FOR FURTHER RELEASE  
REQ -TrainLoc -12 FOR FURTHER RELEASE  [X2R5 REQ -TrainLoc -12] 
If a train reports a position that is unexpected or in conflict with other train movements, 
the MBS shall react to transition the system to a safe state.  
Rationale:  
The MBS is reliant upon trains reporting their position to separate traffic safely  and the 
MBS must therefore react if it detects a potentially hazardous situation.  
Guidance:  
A train reporting an unexpected position can be a hazard even when there is TTD if 
more than one train is in the same TTD section, but the situation is more severe in an 
area without TTD.  
The MBS will only be able to detect conflicts with other train movements which have 
been authorised by the MBS.  
There are several situations where a position report from a train may require immediate 
action from the MBS to avoid a potential hazard, for example:  
• a train reporting a position in an area previously considered clear, e.g. at Start 
of Mission, OR  
• a train which has been allocated a Reserved Status Area reporting a position 
which cannot be linked with that Reserved Status Area, OR  
• a train reporting a position locating it within a Reserved Status Area allocated to 
another train.  
The specific reaction applied will depend on the situation and application specific 
requirements. Possible reactions include:  
• shortening of the Movement Authority for the affected train(s),  
• sending an Unconditional Emergency Stop message to the affected train(s).  
Note that the Train Location  is created or updated by other requirements.  
Operational Rules:  None  
Engineering Rules:  None  
REQ -TrainLoc -13 FOR FURTHER RELEASE  [X2R5 REQ -TrainLoc -13]

FP2-T13_2 -D-ALS-003-10 Page 86 of 197 07/07/2025  
 
 Interne  Rationale:  
This is to make the TMS and Signallers aware in case the reported position could be 
a real or potential hazard for other train movements.  
Guidance:  
A train reporting an unexpected position can be a hazard even when there is TTD if 
more than one train is in the same TTD section, but the situation is more severe in an 
area without TTD.  
The MBS will only be able to detect conflict with other train movements which have 
been authorised by the MBS.  
There are several situations where a position report from a train may require additional 
intervention from the TMS or Signaller to manage the degraded situation. For example:  
• a train reporting a position in an area previously considered clear, e.g. at Start 
of Mission, OR  
• a train reporting a position locating it within a Reserved Status Area allocated 
to another train.

6.9.8  Impact from TTD on Train Locations  
REQ -TTD-1    
For a system using TTD, the MBS shall manage the asynchronicity between TTD section 
status and Train Position Reports for a communicating train.  
Rationale:  
It will occur that the train physically occupies a TTD section before it has reported its 
position within the TTD section (or vice versa). Similarly, the train may physically leave 
a TTD section before it has reported its position beyond the TTD section (o r vice versa). 
The MBS must correlate these events.  
Guidance:  
The MBS must be designed to allow for:  
• A TTD section becoming Occupied by a train before the train has reported a 
position within the TTD section.  
• A train reporting a position within the TTD section before TTD section becomes 
Occupied.  
• A TTD section becoming Clear after a train has left the TTD section before the 
train has reported a position clear of the TTD section.  
  Contract No. HE – 101102001  
  
 
 
FP2-T13_2 -D-ALS-003-10 Page 87 of 197 07/07/2025  
 
 Interne  • A train reporting a position clear of the TTD section before the TTD section 
becomes Clear.  
The MBS could use a variety of technical solutions to correlate TTD occupancy to Train 
Position Reports. For example:  
• Sending a Conditional Emergency Stop when a TTD is occupied, to stop a train 
that is approaching a boundary of the TTD if it is not the one that occupied the 
TTD.  
• Use of a delay timer, to account for lack of synchronisation between Train 
Position Reports and TTD occupancy. If a train is still not detected when the 
timer expires, the MBS would react suitably.  
• Tracking of TTD section occupancy and correlation with Train Position 
Reporting, to ensure a normal sequence is observed.  
Note: a combination of these techniques may be used, depending on project specific 
requirements.

REQ -TTD-2   
For a system using TTD, if the Max Safe Front End reported by a train is located in a clear 
TTD section while the Min Safe Front End is not in this TTD section, then the MBS shall 
shorten the front of the Train Location  for this train, by the extent of each TTD section that 
is detected Clear between the Min Safe Front End and the Max Safe Front End.  
Rationale:  
TTD information can be used to improve the MBS knowledge about the status of the 
track in the Area of Control, thus improving the performance of the system.  
Guidance:  
The effect of a Clear TTD section in the front part of a Train Location  is to update the 
front of the Train Location . 
This can be used to avoid locking points and level crossings in front of the train. Both 
the reception of TTD status and the receiving of a Train Position Report can be the 
trigger for updating the Train Location .

Rationale:  
Applying shortening should not result in the extent of the remaining Train Location  
being less than the length of the train.  
Guidance:  
If the application of shortening the Train Location  results in the length of the Train 
Location  being less than the length of the train, it is project specific what alternative 
action the MBS takes. For example, an application may decide to not apply any 
shortening to the Train Location , or to apply equal shortening to the front and rear.  
At boundaries, projects might decide to truncate the Train Location  and as a result, 
Train Location could be shorter than length of the train.

REQ -TTD-5 FOR FURTHER RELEASE  [X2R5 REQ -TTD-5] 
For a system using TTD, when detecting an expected TTD occupancy within the 
Movement Permission allocated to a train, after its Mute Timer has expired, the MBS shall 
extend the Train Location  of the train up to the closest of:  
• the end of the Movement Permission’s Risk Buffer , OR 
• the next boundary of this Occupied TTD section  
Rationale:  
The MBS can use TTD occupation to extend the Train Location  of a train where the 
Mute Timer has expired and is moving along the railway within the Movement 
Permission allocated to it, thus maintaining the link between the Train Location  and the 
train, thereby facilitating recovery if communication is re -established.  
Guidance:  
A train where the Mute Timer has expired can move forward within the Movement 
Permission allocated to that train and occupy a previously clear TTD. That occupation 
can be attributed to a normal train movement. The MBS can adjust the knowledge 
about where t he train might be by extending the Train Location  of this train.

 Interne  REQ -0037    FOR FURTHER RELEASE  [X2R5 REQ - LossComms -1] 
The MBS shall, if configured, for each train with which it has an active communication 
session supervise a defined timeout (a Mute Timer) after which the communication with 
this train is considered lost.  
Rationale:  
This is to enable the MBS to react faster to the potential loss of communication with an 
OBU than the timeout in the ETCS specifications. The ETCS specification timer of 5 
minutes might be considered too long for some ETCS Level 3 systems.  
Guidance:  
This Requirement is mandatory if the Mute timer is used.  
This is an optional functionality to be defined at application level based on the needs 
of the system. The value of the Mute timer will be longer than the variable 
T_NVCONTACT and shorter than the communication session expiry, as defined in 
[SS026].

When receiving a message from a train and if the use of a Mute Timer is configured, the 
MBS shall (re -)start the Mute Timer for this train.  
Rationale:  
This is for the MBS to be able to react if a message from the train is not received within 
a configured time.  
Guidance:  
This Requirement is mandatory if the Mute timer is used.  
If a Mute Timer is configured it is only active when there is a communication session

When the Mute Timer expires for a train which has not entered an announced Radio Hole, 
and which was not reporting in RV mode, then the MBS shall convert the Train Object  
into an Unresolved Trackbound Object . The Unresolved Trackbound Object  area shall 
correspond to the Train Location  extended to the end of the Movement Permission or the 
end of the MA, whichever is shorter.

 Interne  Rationale:  
This is the area where the non -communicating train could be located, and as such 
needs to be protected.  
Guidance:  
This Requirement is mandatory if the Mute timer is used.  
If the extent of the MA sent to the train is less than the Movement Permission, then the 
extension of the Unresolved Trackbound Object  may only be to the end of the MA sent 
to the train.  
The criteria for establishing whether a train has entered a Radio Hole are project 
specific and could include the train having received radio hole track condition 
information from the MBS.  
Once a train is reporting in RV mode, it is not able to move forwards without performing 
EoM, Start of Mission, so it is not necessary to extend the Unresolved Trackbound 
Object  to the end of the Reserved Status Area or MA.  
The MBS will maintain the communication session with OBU as active even when the 
Mute timer has expired until the maximum time to maintain a communication session 
as specified in SUBSET -026 [BL3 R2] has elapsed.

 Interne  6.9.9  Requirements to delete Train Location  and to create Unresolved 
Trackbound Object  
REQ -0036  FOR FURTHER RELEASE  [X2R5 REQ -EoM-4] 
The MBS shall be able to cope with differences in the confidence interval provided in the 
position report of a train that reported EoM even when related to the same train position.  
 Rationale:  
This is due to an ambiguity in the ETCS specifications around how to calculate the 
Train Location  accuracy when linking information is deleted due to the change to SB 
mode.  
See REQ -EoM-4 
 Guidance:  
This issue is the subject of CR1318 in the ERA CCM Process [CRProcess]. The MBS 
must be able to deal with On -boards which have not applied the solution to CR1318.

REQ -0040   FOR FURTHER RELEASE  [X2R5 REQ -LossComms -4] 
If the Mute Timer is not considered for use on a particular application, the MBS shall react 
when the session timer expires by converting the Train Object  into an Unresolved 
Trackbound Object . The Unresolved Trackbound Object   shall correspond to the Train 
Location  extended to the end of the Movement Permission , except if the train was 
reporting in RV mode.  
 Rationale:  
This is so that, even for applications not utilising the Mute timer functionality, the 
Trackside is protected when communications with a train expire according to the 
existing session expiry timer in the ETCS specifications [BL3 R2].  
 Guidance:  
Whether or not to use the Mute Timer will depend on whether it is required to detect 
loss of communication before expiry of the session timer. This in turn will depend on 
traffic density and the typical speed of trains.  
Once a train is reporting in RV mode, it is not able to move forwards without performing 
EoM and Start of Mission, so it is not necessary to extend the Unresolved Trackbound 
Object  to the end of the Movement Permission.  
  Contract No. HE – 101102001  
  
 
 
FP2-T13_2 -D-ALS-003-10 Page 95 of 197 07/07/2025  
 
 Interne  For a system using TTD, there may be clear TTDs ahead of the train within the 
Movement Permission. In this case, the Unresolved Trackbound Object  can be 
extended to the least distant position of the next TTD that is clear. This is equivalent 
to extending the Unresolved Trackbound Object  up to the end of the MA, in accordance 
with this requirement, and then clearing those parts in accordance with TTD 
requirements.  
Important note:  this requirement assumes that the train is at standstill (or low speed) 
when the session timer expires.

If the MBS receives Validated Train Data for a train with a train length different from 
previously reported within the same communication session, then the MBS shall mark the 
Train Object  as “integrity not confirmed”.  
Rationale:  
If the train reports loss of Train Integrity because of joining or splitting, then this will 
already result in the Train Object  marked as “integrity not confirmed”. This requirement 
is to cover the situation where the new train length is received before the loss of Train 
Integrity.  
Guidance:  
When new train data is entered, the OBU will not confirm Train Integrity until the new 
train data is acknowledged by the MBS. This behaviour is as defined in Change 
Request 940 [CR940].  
Operational Rules:  None  
Engineering Rules:  None  
REQ -LossTI -4   
The MBS shall mark the Train Object  as “integrity not confirmed ” when ‘No train integrity 
information’ is reported longer than a configurable time (Integrity Wait Timer).  
Rationale:  
This is to provide to other consumers entity as P E the information about the train 
integrity.  
Guidance:  
Once Train Integrity is considered Lost by the MBS, the mechanism in REQ -LossTI -2 
is applied.  
It is application specific whether to implement this function. The timer will have a 
special value that means the function is disabled.  
Note that using this timer the Driver will not be aware of the train Integrity being treated 
as Lost by the MBS and as such cannot be expected to react in any manner.  
If the MBS is configured not to accept Train Integrity confirmed by Driver, and Train 
Integrity confirmed by Driver is reported, then the MBS will treat this as “No train 
integrity information”.  
There is no specific relation between the length of the Mute Timer and the Integrity 
Wait timer.

6.10  SYSF MANAGE UNRESOLVED TRACKBOUND OBJECT  
6.10.1  Overview  
The MBS must be aware of all parts of the track that are potentially occupied.  
• For communicating trains that are localised, the occupancy is managed by the Train 
Location  inside Train Object . The MBS will create and update a Train Object  for each 
communicating train.  
• For all other situations, the (potential) occupancy is managed by Unresolved Trackbound 
Object . The MBS will create and update Unresolved Trackbound Object in these cases.  
An Unresolved Trackbound Object  may exist for a specific train, but may also exist for another

 Interne  6.10.2  Propagation concept  
The concept of propagation is based on the idea that an Unresolved Trackbound Object  needs to 
be increased, possibly after a period of time, to allow for the fact that any railway vehicles in the 
Unresolved Trackbound Object  area may move without knowledge of the MBS.  
Within a signalling system with 100% Trackside Train Detection  (TTD), any movement which crosses 
a TTD boundary is likely to be detected (see REQ -TTD-9, REQ -TTD-10, REQ -TTD-12).  
In case of loss of communication, the Movement Permission is also considered as a possible 
envelope for movements of non -reporting vehicles (see REQ -TrainLoc -10). 
Without TTD or if the TTD is already occupied, movements of non -reporting rail vehicles will not be 
detected by the MBS.  
For stationary vehicles, the period of time before propagation is applied could be associated with the 
length of time for which railway vehicle brakes can be expected to remain active, and so keep the 
vehicle(s) stationary.  
Measures are generally put in place at railway project level to prevent or detect and mitigate the risk 
of rolling vehicles moving such that they conflict with other movements:  
• Use of trap points or derailers in station areas and/or sidings  
• Use of Trackside Train Detection  in station areas and/or sidings  
If hazard analysis on a particular railway identifies that the remaining risk of unexpected vehicle 
movement causing a collision is still not acceptable, MBS includes a propagation algorithm within 
TTD ( see REQ -TrainLoc -14, REQ -TrainLoc -15 and REQ -TrainLoc -16) to mitigate this risk.  
6.10.3  Storage requirements  
REQ -TrackStatus -26 FOR FURTHER RELEASE  [X2R5 REQ -TrackStatus -26] 
If an Unresolved Trackbound Object  is created that is within a Movement Permission  
allocated to a train, then the MBS shall react to transition the system to a safe state.  
Rationale:  
A new Unresolved Trackbound Object  within a Movement Permission  allocated to a 
train may require urgent action from the MBS in order to avoid a hazard.  
Guidance:  
The specific reaction applied will depend on the scenario and application specific 
requirements. Possible reactions include shortening of the Movement Authority for 
another train; sending an Unconditional Emergency Stop to one or multiple trains etc.

Reason  From enumerated list 
see Table 12. The reason why the UTO was created.  
There might be more than one reason.  
Table 14 – Unresolved Trackbound Object  Stored Data  
Rationale:  
The Stored Data will be used by recovery mechanisms, for example at Start of Mission, 
recovery after loss of communication,  etc. 
Stored Information can also aid with initialising the MBS after a restart.  
Guidance:  
The Train ID stored will be the NID_ENGINE of the train associated with the 
Unresolved Trackbound Object , if any.  
There may be more than one reason for an Unresolved Trackbound Object .  
Stored Data for Unresolved Trackbound Object  can be used in the following situations:  
a) Joining/Splitting: The Length of trains involved in Splitting and Joining is 
recorded, and the MBS ensures that the full length is accounted for before and 
after the procedure  
b) Start of Mission: Comparing the new train length to the stored train length for an 
Unresolved Trackbound Object , and removing the Unresolved Trackbound 
Object  if the train lengths match  
c) Recovery after loss of communication (new session): New train length received 
is compared with that stored to check that it is the same train reconnecting.

and  
• There is a  recorded train length for this Unresolved Trackbound Object , and  
• The Unresolved Trackbound Object  is not associated to any train.

• the MBS has updated the Train Location  for a train, AND  
• the rear of the Train has moved backward AND  
• there are no adjacent Unresolved Trackbound Object  where the rear of the train 
is localised.  
Rationale:  
If a train has reported new Validated Train Data where the train length has increased, 
and the increase in length cannot be accounted for by the Recorded Train Length in 
some adjacent Unresolved Trackbound Object , then there may have been an error  
when updating the length of this or another train, which should be brought to the 
attention of the PE.

FP2-T13_2 -D-ALS-003-10 Page 102 of 197 07/07/2025  
 
 Interne  Guidance:  
The increase in the train length for the Train Location  will be because the MBS has 
received Validated Train Data with an increased value of L_TRAIN.  
A train is expected to send Validated Train Data with an increased value of L_TRAIN 
if it has performed a joining operation. In this case, there should be one or more 
adjacent Unresolved Trackbound Object , where the additional Recorded Train 
Length(s) can account for the increased train length.  
If there are no adjacent Unresolved Trackbound Object  which can account for the 
increased train length, then some error has occurred, and the TMS will be alerted.  
An inconsistency in the reported length from a train and the length stored by the MBS 
could be due to an error in the stored data, or failure in the application of Operational 
Rules. The MBS may decide to take a protective reaction, such as extending an 
Unresolved Trackbound Object  to cover the Train Location . This reaction is project 
specific.  
Operational Rules:  None

REQ -TrackStatus -9   
When Train Integrity is confirmed by External Source for a train associated with an 
Unresolved Trackbound Object  and the length of this train (L_TRAIN) is equal to the 
recorded length of the UTO, then the MBS shall delete the Unresolved Trackbound 
Object . 
When Train Integrity is confirmed by External Source for a train associated with an 
Unresolved Trackbound Object  and the total recorded length of this UTO plus all other 
UTOs overlapping this latter matches the length of the train (L_TRAIN), then MBS shall 
delete all UTOs matching the length of this train.  
Rationale:  
The Unresolved Trackbound Object  is “replaced” by the Train Location of the Train 
Object  in this case. It is assumed that when a train confirms its train integrity then the 
MBS can trust the length of this train (L_TRAIN). L_TRAIN matches the real length of 
the train (considering stretching).  
Guidance:  
The length of the train could be longer than what is recorded for the Unresolved 
Trackbound Object  in case two trains were joined after performing EoM and the joined 
train is associated with one of two Unresolved Trackbound Object . 
Projects may decide to allow for some tolerance in matching the length of a train with 
what is recorded for the Unresolved Trackbound Object . In that case, the tolerance 
can be the configurable minimum length of Unresolved Trackbound Object , as defined

 Interne  in ENG -Generic -3. Projects may also decide to check if there is another Unresolved 
Trackbound Object  nearby that could explain the new longer Train Length and to alert 
the TMS if this is not the case.  
Figure 33 shows the relationship between Train Location  and the associated 
Unresolved Trackbound Object  for an individual train with Train Integrity, one where 
the length of the train is the same as that recorded for the Unresolved Trackbound 
Object  and one where the length is longer (e.g after joining.  
  
Figure 33: Train Location  after confirmation of Train Integrity  
In the righthand example, there is a step missing when the Train Location  is updated with 
the Train Length after receiving Validated Train Data. In the end, when the total length 
matches the length of the 2 UTOs, the result is the same as in the lefthand figure (i.e. 
both UTOs are deleted by the established Train Location ).

 Interne  REQ -TrackStatus -25  
When receiving Validated Train Data from a train indicating that the train length has been 
decreased, then MBS shall , before applying REQ -TrackStatus -10 
• create an Unresolved Trackbound Object from the rear of the Train Location  
(considering the old train length) to the max safe rear end position of the train 
(considering the new train length)  
• associate the Unresolved Trackbound Object  to this train 
• store the old Train Length (L_TRAIN) in the created Unresolved Trackbound 
Object  if the train is marked as integrity confirmed,  
Rationale:  
As the Train Location  is shortened according to REQ -TrainLoc -6, it is necessary to 
create an UTO to manage the remaining length of the train that is now unresolved. It 
is assumed that when a train confirms its train integrity then the MBS can trust the 
length of this train (L_TRAIN). L_TRAIN matches the real length of the train 
(considering stretching).  
Guidance:  
If this is a changed value of L_TRAIN, then the new value of L_TRAIN could be shorter 
than the previous value, for example after Splitting, as shown in Figure 34.

When Train Integrity is confirmed by External Source for a train associated with an 
Unresolved Trackbound Object  and the length (L_TRAIN) of this train is less than the 
Recorded Train Length, then the MBS shall:  
• remove the part of the Unresolved Trackbound Object  between the Min Safe Front 
End to the Max Safe Rear End of the train  if the front ends do not overlap with the 
rear ends , AND  
• reduce the Recorded Train Length of the remaining Unresolved Trackbound Object  
by the length of the train that confirmed Train Integrity, AND  
• dissociate the Unresolved Trackbound Object  from this train  
Rationale:  
This is required for the MBS to maintain the Unresolved Trackbound Object  within its 
Area of Control when all the train length recorded for an Unresolved Trackbound Object  
is not accounted for by a train confirming integrity.  
Guidance:  
An Unresolved Trackbound Object  cannot be fully recovered if the reported train length 
does not account for all the train length recorded for that area. In this case, the 
Unresolved Trackbound Object  must remain with the recorded train length reduced by 
the length of the train that confirmed integrity.  
The extent of the Unresolved Trackbound Object  will also be reduced because the new 
Train Location  will sweep the part of the Unresolved Trackbound Object  from its Min 
Safe Front End to the Max Safe Rear End. This could result in this area being split in 
two, depending on the Train Location . In that case the recorded train length is the same 
for both Unresolved Trackbound Object . 
Figure 35 shows an example of a train accounting for part of the length recorded for 
an Unresolved Trackbound Object  after splitting and that area being split by the train 
when it confirms integrity. Here, the Front Train After Splitting, train 1 in the figure, 
confirms integrity and leaves before the rear part has performed SoM. As the train 
moves away, it sweeps the p art of the Unresolved Trackbound Object  at the front of 
the train, while the overlapped part at the rear becomes visible.

Figure 35: Unresolved Trackbound Object  remains when Front Train after Splitting leaves  
The process above is repeated if another train performs Start of Mission in the 
remaining Unresolved Trackbound Object . After splitting, any end could perform Start 
of Mission first, but the handling is the same.  
Projects may decide to allow for some tolerance in matching the length of a train with 
what is recorded for the Unresolved Trackbound Object . In that case, the tolerance 
can be the configurable minimum length of Unresolved Trackbound Object , as defined 
in ENG -Generic -3.  
Additionally, projects may decide to additionally remove the UTO in front of the train in 
case the MBS can unambiguously determine that there is no other (part of a) train in 
front, e.g. by comparing the Train ID from the UTO with the Train ID from the train 
performing Start of Mission.

This is to avoid that some train and/or waggons are lost to the MBS when an 
Unresolved Trackbound Object  is split.  
Guidance:  
Unresolved Trackbound Object  can be split by a TTD section detected clear or by a 
train . In some situations, e.g. over a set of points, an Unresolved Trackbound Object  
could even be split in more than two parts.  
If the split is due to a train which confirms integrity, this requirement  is performed after 
REQ -Track Status -10. 
Even if the extents of the split areas are very different, the MBS cannot safely judge if 
one of them should have more of the recorded length than the other and what that

Rationale:  
This is to enable (partial) sweeping of an Unresolved Trackbound Object  that was

REQ -TrackStatus -16 FOR FURTHER RELEASE  [X2R5 REQ -TrackStatus -16] 
When the MBS considers the communication session with a train is terminated, the MBS 
shall convert the Train Location  to an Unresolved Trackbound Object , except if the train 
is completely located inside an Active Shunting Area.  
Rationale:  
This is the area where the train could be located, and as such needs to be protected 
by an Unresolved Trackbound Object .  
Guidance:  
This requirement applies at EoM for trains not inside an Active Shunting Area.  
For a train located completely inside an Active Shunting Area, there is no need for an 
Unresolved Trackbound Object  since there is already an Unresolved Trackbound 
Object  associated with the Active Shunting Area which will protect the train.  
If a train is partially located inside an Active Shunting Area, it is project specific whether 
the MBS authorises the transition to Shunting Mode. Similarly, it is project specific how 
the MBS subsequently manages the overlapping Unresolved Trackbound Object  that 
is created for the location of this train.  
For a train leaving the MBS Area, another requirement deals with the relevant 
Unresolved Trackbound Object  that could be removed when the train has left the area, 
i.e. before the communication session has been terminated.  
Loss of communications is handled by other requirements.

is less than or equal to  a configurable minimum length.  
Rationale:  
This is to avoid having small Unresolved Trackbound Object  that have to be swept 
when it is known that there cannot be a vehicle inside them.  
Guidance:  
Small Unresolved Trackbound Object  could arise from splitting and joining procedures, 
or from sweeping.

FP2-T13_2 -D-ALS-003-10 Page 112 of 197 07/07/2025  
 
 Interne  For example, this requirement could apply to cross -over areas, as in Figure 40: 
 
Figure 40: Short Unresolved Trackbound Object  at crossover  
The configurable minimum length could be related to the length of the shortest vehicle 
that could be running on the line. The Unresolved Trackbound Object  can be removed, 
regardless of the status of adjacent areas.  
In case an Unresolved Trackbound Object  is split in two, e.g. by a clear TTD section, 
and if one of these areas is shorter than the configured minimum distance, then it can 
be removed even if it has a Recorded Train Length because that length is also 
recorded in the other area. Thus, there is n o risk of trains and/or waggons becoming 
lost.

Rationale:  
TTD information can be used to clear the track under degraded situations.  
Guidance:  
TTD can assist with recovery  as there is no need to sweep clear TTD sections.

 Interne  REQ -TTD-8   
For a system using TTD, if the MBS has shortened the extent of an Unresolved 
Trackbound Object , then the MBS shall ensure the resulting Unresolved Trackbound 
Object  is not shorter than the Recorded Train Length stored for it.   
Rationale:  
Applying shortening could result in the extent of the remaining Unresolved Trackbound 
Object being less than the Recorded Train Length.  
An Unresolved Trackbound Object  with an extent shorter than the stored train length 
could represent a hazard.  
Guidance:  
When the application of shortening the Unresolved Trackbound Object  results in the 
length of the Unresolved Trackbound Object  being less than Recorded Train Length, 
it is project specific what alternative action the MBS takes. For example, an application 
may decide to not apply any shortening to the Unresolved Trackbound Object , or to 
apply equal shortening to the front and rear whilst maintaining the length of the 
Recorded Train Length.  
If an Unresolved Trackbound Object  is one part of an Unresolved Trackbound Object 
which has been split, for example by a clear TTD, then project -specific rules may be 
needed, as the Recorded Train Length will be recorded in two Unresolved Trackbound 
Objects; see REQ -TrackStatus -11.

Rationale:  
A TTD occupancy not associated with any expected train movement should be 
considered a potential hazard.  
Guidance:  
Unexpected TTD occupancy also includes a TTD remaining Occupied when it might 
be expected to become Clear. For example, a TTD remaining Occupied behind a train 
which has sent a Train Position Report which gives a position clear of the TTD might 
indicate th e presence of a Ghost Train. Implementation of such a function is project -

movement permission and  adjacent to a TTD containing an existing Unresolved 
Trackbound Object  which has a Recorded Train Length greater than zero, the MBS shall 
extend the Unresolved Trackbound Object  up to the next boundary of this TTD section.  
Rationale:  
A TTD occupancy not associated with any expected train movement should be 
considered a potential hazard.  
Guidance:  
A train which is not communicating can move and occupy a previously clear TTD. That 
occupation can be attributed to the train in the adjacent TTD. The MBS can adjust the 
knowledge about where the train might be by extending the existing Unresolved 
Trackbound Object . 
Unexpected TTD occupancy also includes a TTD remaining Occupied when it might

This function could be used to improve the reliability of the system and overrule false 
occupation reported by TTD (e.g. malfunctioning axle counters).  
In MBS operations, when all train movements are supervised by OBU with train 
position reporting and train integrity confirmation, a faulty TTD could be detected, e.g. 
dependent on the states of the neighbouring TTDs and position reports.

with any regular train movement or Train Location , the MBS shall create an Unresolved 
Trackbound Object  for each adjacent  area if the adjacent area is not completely covered 
by UTO , or is known as cleared (by TTD if available) .  
Rationale:  
A TTD clearance which cannot be associated with any regular train movement or Train 
Location , should be considered a potential hazard, as such the MBS needs to protect 
other train movements by either creating or extending Unresolved Trackbound 
Objects.  
Guidance:  
A TTD becoming unexpectedly clear might be due to several reasons. For example, a 
non-communicating train is moved such that the TTD becomes clear.  
The MBS must react, for example by creating an additional Unresolved Trackbound 
Objects to protect the movement of trains.

applicable in the same direction, or  
• until the first Min Safe Front location found from the UTO to the TTD limit applicable

On request from the PE/Operator Panel, the MBS shall remove, reduce or extend 
Unresolved Trackbound Object . 
Rationale:  
MBS must allow the TMS to remove, reduce or extend Unresolved Trackbound Object  
based on the result of operational procedures.  
Guidance:  
An Unresolved Trackbound Object , both Sweepable and Non -Sweepable, can be 
removed, reduced or extended by the PE/Operator Panel.  
For example, some Infrastructure Managers may permit Unresolved Trackbound 
Object  to be removed or reduced based on the observations of a Driver sweeping on 
an adjacent line.  
Projects may, if providing the necessary information, allow the Dispatcher via 
PE/Operator Panel to remove or reduce parts of an Unresolved Trackbound Object , 
e.g. by stating a certain length to be removed.  
In case there is a train length stored for an Unresolved Trackbound Object  requested 
for removal, it is recommended that the MBS prevents removing this Unresolved 
Trackbound Object  unless the removal is supported by some additional measure(s).

 Interne  Robust operational procedures are required in order to permit the Dispatcher, via the 
PE/Operator Panel, to remove or reduce Unresolved Trackbound Object . 
In case of overlapping Unresolved Trackbound Object  conditions might be considered 
when removing an Unresolved Trackbound Object . 
If the Unresolved Trackbound Object  is Sweepable, the MBS will remove it if it is 
reduced to a length shorter than the configurable minimum length for removal of 
Unresolved Trackbound Object , as defined in ENG -Generic -3.

 Interne  6.11 SYSF AUTHORISE MP REQUEST  
6.11.1  Overview  
This function is responsible to assess the safety of a request to alter the Authorisation of a Train 
Object . PE or the operator through the operator panel can request an Authorisation through the SCI -
CMD interface which is then checked by MBS if it violates any safety constraint. The MBS shall not 
alter the request if certain parameters are incorrect (e.g. The operating state has changed during the 
message transmission between PE and MBS) but only report the failure to PE with the failure reason.  
The MP Request shall contain the following information:  
- Train Object  Identifier  
- Movement Permission  
The Movement Permission shall have the following attributes  
- Risk Buffer  (LinkedPath)  
- Extent (LinkedPath)  
- Requested Maximum Speed in km/h (LinkedPath per different speed)  
- ETCS Movement Mode (Linked Path per different mode)  
- List of DPS Groups that must not be used as flank protection measure  
6.11.1.1  Flank Protection Overview  
Before authorizing an MP request, MBS evaluates if sufficient protections to limit the risk of side -on 
collision according to the safety analysis are in observed between the requested MP and any 
uncontrolled trackbound movement.  
To find the flank protecting measures applicable to the MP request, MBS builds Risk Path  
Candidates that span from the end of the Allocation Sections  up to the corresponding elements 
providing (or not) flank protection (see requirement REQ -RP_SEARCH).  
Note: once a risk path has been created, it may also be updated/deleted without the reception of a 
new MP request (e.g. when a train is moving) through a continuous evaluation (see chapter 6.18). 
For each Risk Path  Candidate that has been built (according to REQ -SC_RP_SEARCH), the MBS 
evaluates if the Risk Path  is correctly terminated (according to REQ -SC_RP_TERM) on an 
element authorised to provide flank protection.  
The elements than can provide flank protections include:  
• Switchable T rack element  
Examples: point from trailing side, derailer/catch point, end of track, etc.  
The position of these points ensures that any uncontrolled trackbound movement 
approaching the side of the Movement Permission will be deviated or derailed.  
• Movement Permission  
  Contract No. HE – 101102001  
  
 
 
FP2-T13_2 -D-ALS-003-10 Page 123 of 197 07/07/2025  
 
 Interne  The side of the Movement Permission is protected by another train supervised by a 
Movement Permission. As the ETCS on -board unit of the other train supervises the train 
movement, this reduces the risk that the train will exceed its authority to an extent that 
could result in a flank collision  
• Train Object  
The side of the Movement Permission is protected by another connected train. If the on -
board unit guarantees that the train will not move without any authority, it is ensured that 
this train will not perform any movements that could result in a flank collision.  
• Protection by a sufficient distance  
The side of the Movement Permission is detected as free over a sufficient distance to 
mitigate the risk a flank collision to an acceptable level.  
• Protection by Operational Rules  
If the risk of flank collision cannot be mitigated by the preceding measures, the final 
option is to reduce the potential consequences of a flank collision if Operational Rule s 
(vehicle should not be moved without permission)  are violated . 
This imposes a reduced speed.

In tracks (usually secondary tracks) where non -controlled movements can occur (shunting, stabling 
of vehicles with remaining rollaway risk), the Infrastructure Manager has to ensure that appropriate 
measures are available:  
• Trap points, catch points/derailers;  
• Prohibitions of shunting and stabling;  
• Equipment with TTD (as otherwise non -controllable movements cannot be detected).

 Interne   
The interface between MBS and PE is impacted by the flank protection as follows:  
• For each granted Movement Permission, the MBS provides to PE the Risk Path  as part of 
the Movement Permission.  
• When requesting a Movement Permission, the PE is able to optionally provide a list of 
DPS that must not be used as flank protection measure.  
 
 
6.11.1.2  Application Example  
 
In the example above the maximum speed for TE3 and TE2 is equal, it is different for TE3 and 
TE4. The whole train running path of TO1 is split in three segments. The split between TE4 and 
TE3 would be due to the change in maximum speed. The split in TE2 is due to the mode change 
from FS to OS.  
Note: the example is not exhaustive and does not show all possible starting conditions and 
terminations of a risk path (e.g. risk path termination by Train Object, risk path starting at a 
diamond crossing).

 Interne  Points and derailers provide flank protection by means that no train can physically 
move towards the flank protection seeking element, if the path is set away from the 
side that needs protection (Check for FULL/NONE). In some cases, the abstracted 
DPS cann ot physically provide flank protection (config variable flankProtection). For 
derailers a regulation exists (for example in Switzerland) that they must not be used if 
the speed of the to be protected train is higher than 120 km/h (variable 
maxFlankProtecti onSpeed).  
Guidance:     
The termination of the Risk Path  was chosen to be the “inner end” of the DPS to have 
a) a clear point to terminate, b) be able to perform an overlap check if the DPSG is 
allowed to move or locked as it serves as a flank protection element and c) to 
distinguish the cases of a DPSG where i t is used as a flank protection measure (and 
thus not able to move) from being in the flank protection area (and thus allowed to 
move).

This function is responsible to assess the safety of a request to co-operatively shorten the Movement 
Authority of a train. The MBS shall not alter the request if certain parameters are incorrect but only 
report the failure to PE with the failure reason.  
The Cooperative Shortening Request shall contain the following information:  
- Train Object  Identifier  
- Requested Stop Location  
- Risk Buffer  (LinkedPath)  
6.12.2  Inputs  
- Cooperative Shortening Request message according to I_PE

REQ -SAFETY -COOPERATIVE  
The MBS shall perform a series of checks given by the following ordered list when it 
receives a Cooperative Shortening Request indicating a request to co -operatively shorten 
an MA through I_PE:  
1. REQ -SYNTAX  (see ‘Authorise MP Request’)  
2. REQ -TOPO1 ( see ‘Authorise MP Request’)  
3. REQ -TOPO2 ( see ‘Authorise MP Request’)  
4. REQ -COOP_ TO_EXIST

6. REQ -STOP_LOCATION_IN_REAR_OF_EOA  
7. REQ -COOP_TRANSLATE  
8. REQ -COOP_RISK_BUFFER  
9. REQ -COOP_PENDING  
Rationale:  The request to allow a train movement shall be safeguarded.  
Guidance: This is the top requirement for all necessary checks.  
Operational Rules: None  
Engineering Rules: None  
REQ -COOP -FAILS   
The MBS shall abort checking a Cooperative Shortening Request received through I_PE 
if any performed safety check fails and send a “REQUEST_REJECTED” reply.  
Rationale:    A safety check could require the correct execution of a previous 
safety check.  
Guidance:     None  
Operational Rules:  None  
Engineering Rules:  None  
REQ -COOP -SUCCESSFUL   
If none of the safety checks fails, MBS shall send an “REQUEST_GRANTED” reply.  
Rationale:    By this message, PE is informed that the MBS accepts its 
request and sends the corresponding Request to Shorten MA message to the OBU .

REQ -COOP_TO_EXIST  
The MBS shall check that the Train Object  referenced in the Cooperative Shortening 
Request exists and if the check fails, the MBS shall send a 
“COOP_TO_NOT_EXISTENT” reject code.  
Rationale:    A co-operative shortening can be only applied to a train known 
to the MBS.  
Guidance:    None  
Operational Rules:  None  
Engineering Rules:  None  
REQ -COOP_FS_OS  
The MBS shall check that the mode of the train is either FS or OS and if the check fails, 
the MBS shall send a “COOP_INVALID_MODE” reject code.  
Rationale:    The OBU does not accept a Request to Shorten MA message in 
other modes (supported by the MBS) according to chapter 4.8.4 (/ETCS/).  
Guidance:    According to chapter 4.8.4 (/ETCS/), an OBU would also accept 
a Request to Shorten MA message in the modes LS and AD, but those modes are 
not in scope of the System Specification of the MBS yet.   
Operational Rules:  None  
Engineering Rules:  None  
REQ - STOP_LOCATION_IN_REAR_OF_EOA  
The MBS shall check that the requested stop location of the Cooperative Shortening 
Request is located within the currently stored Movement Permission and if the check fails, 
the MBS shall send a COOP_NOT_IN_REAR reject code.  
Rationale:    According to chapter 4.8.4 (ETCS/), MBS should propose a 
shortened MA with an EOA closer to the train than the current EOA/LOA.  
Guidance:    None  
Operational Rules:  None  
Engineering Rules:  None  
REQ -COOP_TRANSLATE  
The MBS shall translate the requested MP into a Request to Shorten MA message as if 
it was granted by the MBS and if the translation from a Movement Permission into a 
Request to Shorten MA message fails, MBS shall send a 
“COOP_MA_CONSTRUCTION_FAILED” rejec t code.

FP2-T13_2 -D-ALS-003-10 Page 167 of 197 07/07/2025  
 
 Interne  Rationale:    The generation of a Request to Shorten MA  may fail if e.g. the 
extent in the requested Movement Permission is located in rear of the current LRBG 
of the train (since a Request to Shorten MA message cannot be sent with a shifted 
location reference accordi ng to /ETCS/).  
Guidance:    None  
Operational Rules:  None  
Engineering Rules:  None  
REQ -COOP_ RISK_BUFFER  
The MBS shall perform all checks related to the Risk Buffer  contained in the Cooperative 
Shortening Request of the function ‘Authorise MP Request’ and if one of the check fails, 
the MBS shall send the corresponding reject code.  
Rationale:    The Cooperative Shortening Request can contain a Risk Buffer  
and therefore the (safety) checks for the Risk Buffer  have to be performed.  
Guidance:    None  
Operational Rules:  None  
Engineering Rules:  None  
REQ -COOP_ PENDING  
The MBS shall check that there is no pending co -operative shortening for the referenced 
train in the Cooperative Shortening Request and if the check fails, the MBS shall send a 
“COOP_PENDING” reject code.   
Rationale:    It is considered as unlikely that PE would trigger several co -
operative shortenings at the same time for one train. Thus, when MBS would allow 
this, this would unnecessarily the complexity of the MBS system.

 Interne  6.13.4  Functional requirements  
REQ -0048   
When a valid Movement Permission is received, the MBS shall translate the Movement 
Permission into a Movement Authority.  
Rationale:    The MA is supplied to the on -board to allow the on -board 
equipment to control the train movement. The Movement Permission has to be 
supplied to the OBU as a Movement Authority in compliance with the interface I_OBU.  
Guidance:    None.  
Operational Rules:  None  
Engineering Rules:  None  
REQ -0049   
The End of Movement Authority shall be the location at the end of the Movement 
Permission Extent . 
Rationale:    The End of Movement Authority is the target of the Movement 
Permission and the Risk Buffer  starts from there.  
Guidance:    None.  
Operational Rules:  None  
Engineering Rules:  None  
REQ -0050   
The Target Speed at the End of Movement Authority shall be zero.  
Rationale:    Target speed is set to 0 and Risk Buffer  starts just after.  
Guidance:    None.  
Operational Rules:  None  
Engineering Rules:  None  
REQ -0051   
If a Risk Buffer  is present in the Movement Permission, the Danger Point of the Movement 
Authority shall be a location at a fixed distance (safe margin) in rear of the end of the Risk 
Buffer . 
Rationale:    The danger point is the Supervised Location that the train shall 
not overpass. A safe margin is nevertheless added to consider some degraded 
cases (see Guidance).  
  Contract No. HE – 101102001  
  
 
 
FP2-T13_2 -D-ALS-003-10 Page 170 of 197 07/07/2025  
 
 Interne  Guidance:    The safe margin (defined at Project Level) considers that it is not 
always guaranteed that the train stops in rear of the Danger Point if certain 
assumptions are not fulfilled e.g.:  
- That the available wheel -rail adhesion is better than or equal to that assumed in the 
ETCS braking curve calculation.  
- That the train does not accelerate on approach to the EOA (release speed 
calculation assumes no acceleration ). 
- That the compensation of speed measurement inaccuracy is not inhibited by 
national value.  
If any of these assumptions are not true, then the SvL protection is not guaranteed by the 
ETCS OBU. The safe margin provides a mitigation in case any of these assumptions 
is not fulfilled.  
The safe margin also considers  the risk associated with the potential rollback of a chased 
train and the train overhang (between the TTD border and the physical train end) . 
 
Operational Rules:  None  
Engineering Rules:  None  
REQ -0052   
If a danger point is defined, the release speed shall be calculated (Project Specific) based 
on the information contained in the Movement Permission.  
Rationale:    The release speed as such is an operational decision.  
Guidance:    The release speed value impacts the length of the associated 
Risk Buffer . 
For example, based on the Project decision,  the Release speed can be:  
• Set to 0 or to the specific value «calculated on board» . 
• Set to a value dependent on the  Risk Buffer length and/or the  train category .

 Interne  Movement Authority shall be defined without an overlap.  
Rationale:    The use of overlap is considered as not needed. Once the train 
is at standstill, it should be possible for the PE to request to reduce the Risk Buffer  
by Cooperative Shortening Movement Authority if there is an operational need to do 
so. 
Guidance:    None.

REQ -TrainLoc -10  [X2R5 REQ -TrainLoc -10] 
When the communication session with a leading OBU is terminated for trackside, then 
the MBS shall : 
• create an Unresolved Trackbound Object  corresponding to the Train Location  
extended to the end of the Movement Permission . 
• store the Train Length (L_TRAIN) in the created Unresolved Trackbound Object     if 
the train is marked as integrity confirmed  
• delete the Train Location  and the  Movement Permission   
Rationale:  
The MBS cannot determine the Train Location  for a train when the communication 
session has been terminated or is considered terminated.  
Guidance:  
Communication session is terminated for trackside according to /ETCS/ - SUBSET -26 
chapter 3.5.5 and 3.5.4.2.1  
If the train was within or partially within the Area of Control when the communication

Rationale:  
The MBS does not need to maintain a Train Location  for trains beyond its Area of 
Control.  
Guidance:  
This applies to both Handovers and Transitions.  
How the removal is achieved is project specific. Options include:  
• Monitoring the Train Location  for a train which is leaving the Area of Control, 
until it is completely beyond the boundary of the Area of Control.  
• Truncating the Train Location  at the boundary for a train which is leaving the 
Area of Control, until it has zero length within the Area of Control.  
It is also possible to use short TTD sections at boundaries of the Area of Control to 
determine when a train has left the area.

pressed the start button or that the time before reaching perturbation location is reached. In the first 
case, this additionally indicates that both the OBU and t he driver are ready to accept authorisations 
(e.g. Movement Authority or SR Authorisation).).  
Therefore, the MBS shall forward each MA Request message received from OBU to the PE by 
sending an Authorisation Requested message.  
6.16.2  Inputs  
MA Request message  
6.16.3  Outputs  
Authorisation Requested message  
6.16.4  Functional requirements  
REQ -0044     
When the MBS receives an MA Request message from the OBU, then the MBS shall 
send an Authorisation Requested message to the PE indicating the reason for this 
request (e.g. driver has pressed the start button)  
Rationale:  
This is necessary to indicate to the PE that e.g., the driver has pressed the start button 
or the time before reaching perturbation location is reached.  
Based on this information, the PE or TMS may decide to send a Movement Permission 
to the MBS or not.

6.18.4  Functional requirements  
REQ -0070  
After MBS has granted a Movement Permission, it shall store the new Movement 
Permission as the current MP of the corresponding Train Object . 
Rationale:     A Movement Permission that has been granted shall become 
the currently active Movement Permission of a Train Object . 
Guidance:    None  
Operational Rules:  None  
Engineering Rules:  None  
REQ -0071  
When there is an update of the Train Location  then MBS shall modify the Movement 
Permission so that the start of the Movement Permission equals the rear of the Train 
Location . 
Rationale:    This ensures that any parts of the track that are not used by the 
train anymore can be (re -)used for train movements of other trains.  
Guidance:    None  
Operational Rules:  None  
Engineering Rules:  None  
REQ -0072  
When MBS receives a “Request to Shorten MA is granted ” message, then MBS shall 
modify the Movement Permission so that the end of the Movement Permission Extent  
equals the requested stop location and the Risk Buffer  corresponds to the one  received in 
the Cooperative Shortening Request , and subsequently informs PE by sending the 
“Cooperative MP Request Granted” message.  
Rationale:  When MBS has received the “Request to shorten MA is granted” message, 
then this implies that the train has accepted the new MA. Thus, the old part of the 
MA won’t be used by the train anymore and hence can be used for other train 
movements (e.g. for joinin g purposes)   
The “Cooperative MP Request Granted” message is sent to explicitly inform PE that the 
co-operative shortening of MA was successful.

When MBS receives a “Request to Shorten MA is rejected” message then MBS shall 
provide this information by sending the “Cooperative MP Request Rejected” message to 
PE.  
Rationale:    As the OBU has not accepted the new MA in this case, the 
Movement Permission must not be updated. The message “Cooperative MP 
Request Rejected” is sent to explicitly inform PE that the co -operative shortening of 
MA was not successful.

6.18.5  Functional requirements  for Risk Path  update  
REQ -0075 
When any part of the Movement Permission is updated or deleted, if an Allocation Section  
does not overlap the Movement Permission  Extent  anymore, MBS shall delete the Risk 
Paths  calculated from the dependent Allocation Section  according to REQ -RP_SEARCH . 
Rationale:    Flank Protection is not needed anymore if the Allocation Section  
does not overlap the path anymore .

7 INTERFACE SPECIFICATIONS  
7.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE EXTERNAL INTERFACE I_TACS  
7.1.1  Role of the external interface  
The interface I_TACS allows the Moving Block System:  
• to send commands to the TACS to move switchable TAs to the required state, and  
• to receive from the TACS the state of the TA.  
Indeed, to enable a train run from A to B, the Moving Block System commands to the TACS the 
setting of the TA to the required state to allow the movement of the train from A to B.  
To manage the train positioning and the movement of the trains, the Moving Block System also 
needs to acquire through the TACS the state of all the TA inside its Area of Control  (AoC.)  
The interface I_TACS covers the following interfaces defined in EULYNX:  
• Subsystem – Train Detection System (SCI -TDS) if TTD is used  
• Subsystem – Point (SCI -P)

7.4 DESCRIPTION OF THE EXTERNAL INTERFACE I_DR  
7.4.1  Role of the external interface  
By this interface, MBS  gets the static Topology Data . This is the case both at startup and during run -
time where there is the possibility to update existing Topology Data  to a new version. Particularly it 
is possible to exchange a part of existing Topology Data  e.g. as result of construction work.  
7.4.2  Overview  
Until release 4, Topology Data  will cover the whole Area of Control  and will immediately be valid 
(activated) after reception.  
  Contract No. HE – 101102001  
  
 
 
FP2-T13_2 -D-ALS-003-10 Page 189 of 197 07/07/2025  
 
 Interne  In a further release, Topology Data  can cover an arbitrary part of the Area of Control  and follow a 
lifecycle:  
• First, they will be distributed (pre -loaded)  
• Then, MBS  will be asked for authorisation of the Topology Data  activation where it checks 
for conflicting Movement Permission s and if there is no conflict, establishes a Usage 
Restriction Area  to keep the updated area free of future Movement Permission s until the 
activation is finished  
• Then, Topology Data  become pre -activated and MBS can start to synchronise with the TACS  
(of changed or new Trackside Asset s) 
• Finally, MBS  is asked for activation, removes the Usage Restriction Area  and uses the new 
data from now on

• Parameter: messageLength (total length of message)  
• Parameter: dateTime (sending date and timestamp of message)  
Further on, the parameter consumerId will be the unique identification of MBS  (configurable value). 
The parameter DomainId is under discussion. It currently pretends that updateable Topology Data  
areas are fixed (pre -configured) but it shall be achieved that any sub -area, which cannot be pre -
defined, shall be updateable. Until clarification it is used below, but the inherent future meaning shall 
be that the Topology Data  themselves (parameter requestedDomainData are such that they allow 
identification of wh at sub -area they are replacing; the DomainId  would then not be needed anymore.

REQ -0010  Ivan  Only when it is discarded? 
Shouldn't all the messages 
be logged to the 
Diagnostic system?  TBD. I agree. Perhaps it 
would be better to 
consider an alarm (instead 
of event) in this case. This 
is in line with the 
comment of Bettina here 
after. This should be 
clarified within a general 
chapter "log and alarm"

 Interne  GLOSSARY  
Check:  General procedure which ascertains if certain conditions hold (e.g., [check if] each end of a 
railway point is connected to a track section).  
Configuration Data:  Further information relevant for system operation that is not contained in 
topology, topography or infrastructure data (e.g., identifiers & connection parameters for object 
controllers and parameters for safety checks.)  
Static Speed Profile:  A static speed profile that is dynamically calculated by MBS and subsequently 
provided to the relevant train onboard unit.  
Hazard:  A hazard is defined as “a system state or set of conditions that, together with a particular 
set of worst -case environmental conditions, will lead to a loss” [1].  
Infrastructure data:   Additional information not contained in the topography but necessary for 
physical train operations (e.g., static speed profiles, cant, ...)  
Loss:   Within STPA, a loss is defined as an unacceptable event which harms “something of value 
to stakeholders.” [1]. Typical values to protect include human life (loss of life), system function (loss 
of mission), the environment (loss of environment), etc.   
Movement Authority:  Permission for a train to run to a specific location within the constraints of the 
infrastructure [19].  
Movement Permission:   Request from PE to MBS to grant a defined MA for a certain train.  
Safety Design Recommendation:  Exported less stringent “recommendation” regarding the findings 
in this document versus more stringent “safety requirements” that may result from a later generation 
of this analysis.  
Safety Requirement:  A requirement based on findings from a safety analysis (see safety design 
recommendation).  
Safety Responsibility:  Defined responsibility with regards to safety functions of individual actors, 
systems or sub -systems.   
Topography:  Refers to geographical map information regarding the features of the terrain that 
correctly represent physical reality (geographical position, elevation,  ...).  
Topology:  Subset of topography with linked track sections and identified track elements.  
Unsafe Control Action:  “An Unsafe Control Action (UCA) is a control action that, in a particular 
context and worst -case environment, will lead to a hazard” [1].   
System Level Constraints:  “A system -level constraint specifies system conditions or behaviours 
that need to be satisfied to prevent hazards (and ultimately prevent losses)” [1].  
Validation:  “Confirmation, through the provision of objective evidence, that the requirements for a 
specific intended use or application have been fulfilled.”[3] This means validation is intended to 
ensure that the MBS meets the operational needs of the user.  
Verification:  “Confirmation, through the provision of objective evidence, that specified requirements 
have been fulfilled.”[3] This means verification is intended to check that the MBS meets its set of 
design specifications.

 Interne  1 INTRODUCTION  
This present document constitutes the technical contribution from Task 13.3 “Safety Analysis” to the 
Deliverable D13.1 “Moving Block Specifications applying a train -centric approach” in the framework 
of WP13, of FP2 R2DATO.  
“The objective of this task was to work collaboratively to analyze the impact of System Pillar activities 
and Tasks (13.1 Definition/13.2 Specification) to develop a Moving Block Safety Analysis considering 
also the S2R results.” /R2DATO Grant Agreement/  
To move a step beyond what was previously done in S2R (e.g., in -depth analysis of relevant 
scenarios) a novel method – called System Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) - shall be applied to 
the matter. This STPA focuses on “unsafe control actions” in contro l and feedback loops within 
complex systems. An advantage over previous methods is the potential to identify emergent risks 
stemming from the interaction between those (sub)systems, which are often overlooked.  
The subject of this analysis is the “Moving Block System” (MBS) that is being defined and specified 
in WP13. The figure below shows its localization within the planned Moving Block Demonstrator 
(MBD) from WP44/45. In this preliminary architecture it is for eseen that the MBS receives its topology 
model (Domain Data) from an entity designated as Digital Register (DR). Various commands and 
requests (e.g., requests to move a point/request to grant a movement permission) come from the 
Plan Execution (PE) that ex ecutes the operational plan from the Traffic Management System (TMS). 
On the other side, MBS facilitates communication with and also commands the Onboard -Units (OBU) 
and Trackside Asset Control & Supervision (TACS) – aka trackside object controllers.

 Interne  The approach is “train -centric” in the sense that the physical train itself is considered as the main 
business object instead of indirectly deriving information about the train only by monitoring track 
occupations. Since we apply “moving block principles”, movement authorities can therefore be 
issued up to any point on the track, and trains can safely foll ow each other in absolute braking 
distance without being bound to wait for the next block section to become free. However, the system 
shall still be able to utilize information from previously installed Train Detection Systems (TDS) to 
complement and impro ve localization information where applicable (e.g. if receiving a OBU radio 
transmission takes longer than receiving occupation information from the TDS), and/or for migration 
purposes. Some advantages of the new system are:  
• potential performance gains due to smaller train headway times.  
• reduced efforts for TDS and obsolete lineside signals (cab side signaling).  
• the merger of interlocking and RBC functionality, that enables the MBS system to even 
consider physical trains (since traditional IXL was only concerned about securing routes).   
• the concentration of safety related functions into as few “safety -critical” components as 
possible (thereby reducing the SIL requirement for other components).  
• the (envisaged) capability of runtime configuration updates.  
• (envisaged) improved supplier independence due to open/fully defined interfaces.  
 
MBS is thus by design “the component performing safety related functions” within this novel trackside 
CS. The implications of this approach on overall system safety are of great interest.  
Previous investigations were focused on train localization (performance), radio communication 
(performance and availability), cold movement detection, as well as train length - and train integrity 
data. Ideally, the safety requirements from there can be map ped to the new results. However, a 
focus of this analysis are the control (inter -)actions and feedback between the adjacent systems 
(e.g., what are the main hazards that emerge from command and feedback loop between MBS and 
a safety operator panel).

 Interne  2 SCOPE  
The analysis for the Task 13.3 details the results of the safety analysis with focus on the MBS and 
its interfaces to the other internal and external systems, as depicted in Figure 2 - MBS System 
Boundary . It is based on the STPA analysis method for the current safety analysis and considers the 
result from the former X2Rail project. The STPA analysis proved to be the most suitable method at 
a time, when the system requirements and the system design were st ill subject to significant 
changes. Like in traditional safety methods, the efforts involved are highly depend ent on the level of 
depth to which the STPA shall be conducted, and since the task resources are limited (due to overall 
WP allocation as well as due to the number of active authors) an adaptive approach is applied. While 
the whole system -stack involved in “command control & signaling” shall be covered at a high 
abstraction level, certain points of interest (e.g., where valuable information for feed back to the 
specification task can be generated) can be investigated on a lower abstraction level, down to 
individual control/feedback telegrams.  
The analysis does not provide all the evidence to obtain certification or to fulfil the mandatory 
requirements or design standards (e.g.: EN50126 -1 and -2, EN50128, EN50129, EN50159, ...). 
However, it will define safety related design recommendations which  shall be considered during the 
development of the MBS and may be mapped to safety requirements in a later stage.  
The overall analysis of the whole Moving Block Demonstrator (MBD) as depicted in Figure 1 below 
is covered in WP44/45 (Task 45.5.).  
 
2.1 SYSTEM BOUNDARY  
As briefly described in the introduction, the system boundary of MBS is defined through interfaces 
within the Moving Block Demonstrator ( MBD) (e.g., I_PE, I_DR) and also to the outside of the MBD 
(e.g., I_TACS, I_TACS). Even though similar definitions have already been produced within Task 
13.1, 13.2 and 44.3 we decided to reproduce (copy/update/rewrite) such a section here – at least 
until the documents from these tasks are in a stable version. Within this section there is also a 
description of all the sub systems depicted in the drawing below. Relevant Interface descriptions can 
be found in chapter  6 Interface Criticality  together with a preliminary analysis of the interface 
criticality. The handover to neighboring systems is out of scope for this analysis.

 Interne  3 INPUTS  
The documents, project outputs, open standards as well as documents from tasks within R2DATO 
that are relevant to the work here are listed and briefly described in this chapter.  
3.1 SYSTEM PILLAR INPUTS  
System Pillar provided an envelope for the ERJU activities within the “common business objectives” - 
and the “operational visions” documents. Relevant passages have been cited below and shall be 
e.g., used as a benchmark for concluding remarks (in a later s tage of the document).  
3.1.1  CBO ([6], p.18) - Optimize safety strategies and standards  
• Safety critical elements of a system should be optimized and simplified through design by 
moving away from bespoke solutions. The development of these parameters facilitates a 
common approach to safety and security. (simplified standard safety components)  
• Simulation and modelling tools are needed to accurately calculate and validate the 
performance of systems with an incorporated robust PRAMSS framework controlling for the 
development process and the RAMSS change impact analysis for changes inside of the li fe 
cycle. (validated system performance) (robust PRAMSS framework)  
• The safety logic shall have a generic approval and authorization in which it is proven that it just 
needs a reliable input of topology information and train information and will assure safety on 
this basis. {safety logic with generic safety approval}  
• The exchange of components or connection of new subsystems under production shall happen 
without a new safety case or preparation processes. {seamless and selective exchange of 
components under production}  
• An authorized vehicle can be operated everywhere on compliant infrastructure without local 
integration test. {vehicle is interoperable without local integration test}  
3.1.2  Operational Vision ([7], p.20) - Enhanced safety assurance process  
• Because of a high architecture quality, safe integration of components to a whole safe 
application is just done by a centralized (online) compliance test (certificate), that is done once 
(strategy “modular safety”).  
• The quality of validation/testing and practical risk assessment for components and “system of 
systems” reaches a quality level, that allows to simplify bureaucratic development processes 
of today.  
• Independent/redundant/stable safety monitoring systems and actor advisory systems allow a 
more dynamic change of systems and diversity of configurations and support a continuous 
improvement process.  
3.1.3  Operational Scenarios  
Missing. Implicitly defined operational scenarios within the use - and test -cases from Task 44.2. will 
be analyzed instead until other information is available.

 Interne  4 SAFETY  ANALYSIS  METHODEOLOGY  
This chapter describes the used safety analysis methodologies on a very high abstraction level. Even 
though some aspects of the larger demonstrator (MBD) architecture have to be taken into account, 
the target of this safety analysis is the Moving Block Sys tem (MBS). The analysis is partly based on 
outputs from predecessor projects, such as X2Rail and RCA, but it also relies on inputs from system 
pillar, as well as the results from connected tasks within R2DATO.  
The envisaged goal for the demonstrator (MBD) is TRL (Technology Readiness Level) 6 [20]. At this 
stage, the complete safety analysis is qualitative only, not quantitative. Quantitative methods, such 
as fault trees to verify specific safety objectives, may  be added in a later stage when a higher TRL 
shall be achieved.  
Figure 3 shows the scope of the safety analysis in the so called “hourglass model” from CENELEC 
EN 50126 -2.

 Interne  4.1 COMMON  SAFETY  METHODS  
For safety -relevant changes to railroad systems (e.g., technical, operational, regulative or 
organizational changes), the risk assessment process in accordance with EU regulations 2015/1136 
and 402/2013 (CSM -RA) must be applied.  
However, technical changes to a system that are handled with the RAMS management process of 
the CENELEC standard EN 50126 (+128/129) are generally compliant with the CSM procedure.  
4.2 CENELEC  STANDARDS  
Tasks 13.1 and 13.2 within work package 13 are developed along the relevant CENELEC standards. 
Thus, the following standards apply:  
• EN 50126 -1:2017: Generic RAMS Process  
• EN 50126 -2:2017: Systems Approach to Safety  
• EN 50716:2023: Requirements for software development (supersedes EN 50128:2011: 
Software)  
• EN 50129:2018: Electronic systems  
They shall be applied as far as practicable for a TRL 6 system. This means that the standards will 
be taken as a major input for the development, but some requirements may be interpreted in a more 
relaxed way as it would be the case for a fully operational  system.  
4.3 STPA  
The STPA handbook [1] describes the practical application of STPA in great detail. Here, we only 
provide a very short description and the reason why STPA was chosen.  
STPA (System -Theoretic Process Analysis) is a method to identify hazards and related system 
constraints in complex systems, in order to identify (unsafe) control actions that lead to those hazards 
(and related losses). Mitigations to avoid these unsafe con trol actions can then be derived.  
The reason why STPA was chosen is that it is geared towards large and complex systems with 
multiple interactions, where hazards do not necessarily only arise due to component failures, but 
also due to emergent behavior involving multiple components. The MB S (especially in combination 
with its interfaces and interactions with the environment) is a novel system, for which this method is 
believed to be of great value.  
5 RISK ANALYSIS  
This chapter details and documents the results of the conducted STPA analysis as described in 
chapter  4.3. The analysis focuses on the marked section of the “hourglass model” from CENELEC 
EN 50126 -2 as shown in Figure 3 which is intended to derive the safety requirements from operator 
point of view. These requirements must be considered by the suppliers of an MBS system. The 
supplier’s safety analysis shall consider these requirements as their safety goals, that can be b roken 
down into further sub safety goals and requirements.

5.1 LOSSES  
The first step of the STPA is to define which losses to consider for the analysis. The purpose of the 
analysis is to find possible causes for accidents. An accident is defined as an undesired or unplanned 
event that results in a loss. A loss always involve s something of value to the stakeholder. Typical 
examples are loss of human life or injury, but also property damage, environmental pollution or loss 
of mission. [1] For this analysis, three main losses are considered:

ID Name

  • Trespassers (persons present on railway premises where such presence is  
      forbidden)  
L-3 Environmental loss (i.e. transport of dangerous goods)  
Table 11 – Losses  
Explicitly excluded from this analysis are loss of mission and loss of customer satisfaction, as our 
focus for this analysis is strictly on safety (e.g., a person’s life).  
5.2 HAZARDS  
The next step of the analysis is to find the system level hazards. Within STPA, a hazard is defined 
as “a system state or set of conditions that, together with a particular set of worst -case environmental 
conditions, will lead to a loss” [1]. Note that thi s definition differs from the classical definition of a 
hazard. It is essential that hazards are defined at system level instead of component level, as 
hazards may also arise from the interaction between components and cannot necessarily be 
assigned to a s ingle component.  
A system is defined as “a set of components that act together as a whole to achieve some common 
goal, objective, or end” [1]. It may contain subsystems and the analysis may be based higher or 
lower level of abstraction of individual subsystems as needed.  
In order to identify system level hazards, it is therefore necessary to identify the system under 
consideration and the analysis boundary as defined in chapter  2.1 System Boundary . A useful way 
to define the analysis boundary may be to include only systems within the analysis boundary over 
which the system designers have some form of control.  
To ease readability the hazards are described in a generic form. Each hazard may have multiple 
sub-hazards, further detailing the high -level hazard.  
The hazards differentiate between losses in connection with other trains and hazards in connection 
with “other obstacles”. For the purposes of this analysis, runaway trains are regarded as “other 
obstacles".

regions). A region becomes unsafe due to events that cannot be planned, e.g., tunnel fire, landslide, 
avalanche, broken rails, storm, flooding, …   
Nevertheless, it is possible to detect these events with the use of sensors, or the operator (informed by 
e.g., the driver) manually instructs the system.

 Interne  5.4 HIERARCHICAL CONTROL STRUCTURE  (HCS)  
The hierarchical control structure models the system using functional components called controllers. 
Higher level controllers may enforce constraints on the controlled system by using control actions. 
Additionally, controllers may receive information from other controllers as feedback. Together the 
controllers form feedback control loops, shaping the overall behavior of the system.  
 
Which actions a controller performs is determined by its control algorithm, representing the decision -
making process. The information available to the controller at decision time is represented by the 
process model. A simple case of a control feedback loop  is illustrated in Figure 5. 
 
 
Figure 5 - Simple control -loop  
 
The controller in the hierarchical control structure (HCS) is a functional representation, which may 
represent a single system or multiple system. A controller may be a human as well as a technical 
system. The control structure may be represented using mul tiple levels, where system details for 
lower levels are added as needed for the analysis.  
A very high -level control structure for the CCS system is shown in  Figure 6.

5.5 ASSUMPTIONS  
When analyzing a (not yet fully specified) system, a number of assumptions about its environment 
and internal operations are needed. Assumptions from the WP13 System Definition (as recorded in 
[17]) are used where they are directly relevant for the safety analysis. The corresponding System 
Description IDs are referenced at the end of the assumptions in square brackets where applicable.

 Interne  ID Name  ID Overall  
[ASM -2] MBS receives position information from the trains OBU and uses 
the train position information to derive movement authorities (train 
centric approach).  [G1] 
[ASM -3] Only ETCS Level 2 (previously Level 2/3 or R) equipped trains are 
supported by the MBS during normal operation. Trains without 
TIMS are supported for migration scenarios, when TTDs are 
available.  [G2] 
[ASM -4] MBS does not require TTDs but supports them for migration 
scenarios.  [G3] 
[ASM -5] MBS aims to have as little manual intervention (e.g. by the 
operator) as possible.  [G4] 
[ASM -6] MBS operation assumes trains are equipped with a TIMS (Train 
integrity monitoring system). However, in degraded modes and for 
migration purposes operation without TIMS is supported as well.  [G5] 
[ASM -7] MBS is responsible for safety control and should contain a generic 
and simple safety logic. The operational commands are generated 
by other systems.  [A2] 
[ASM -8] Train length and train integrity confirmation are relevant for a SIL 
4 functions and therefore have to be provided with appropriate 
correctness guarantees for these functions.  [T0] 
[ASM -9] The train length reported by the OBU represents the maximum 
train length (e.g. after stretching).  [T1] 
[ASM -10] Changes in the communication technology to the Trains will 
neither affect the content of the messages defined in the ETCS 
Definitions nor the transit time (TBD s) of the messages between 
the Moving Block System and the trains.  [T2] 
[ASM -11] MBS functionality does not change whether the train is operated 
by a human driver or ATO.  [T3, T4]  
[ASM -12] MBS requires that the cold movement of trains is detected. This 
could be performed e.g. by a cold movement detection device 
(CMD device).  [T7] 
[ASM -13] The Train OBU and the infrastructure elements/OCs are SIL -4 
systems.  - 
[ASM -14] The PE can be a SIL Basic Integrity safety related and non-safety 
related system.  -

[ASM -15] The integrity of communication between the train OBU and MBS 
is ensured by a SIL -4 system.  - 
[ASM -16] The integrity of communication between the train infrastructure 
elements/OCs and MBS is ensured by a SIL -4 system.  - 
[ASM -17] Object controllers are correctly installed and configured. This can 
be checked by operational procedures with optional automated 
support (e.g. flagging the configuration as correct after multiple 
successful train passings) (i.e. the position reported by a railway 
point will not be incorrect due to wrong wiring of the 4 -wire-bus).  - 
[ASM -18] Every train is identified by a unique and unchangeable identifier.  - 
[ASM -19] MBS assumes that the train is declared compliant („zugelassen“) 
with the tracks by the IM.  - 
[ASM -20] A train must be able to stop before the EoA/danger point. The 
braking curve is supervised by the trains OBU.  - 
[ASM -21] Safety Related text messages will not be sent by the operator. 
Instead, such message should be generated by automated 
systems (e.g., MBS).  - 
[ASM -22] Interaction between the operator and MBS only involves safety 
related information.  
 - 
[ASM -23] Other interactions of the operator with the system are done via the 
PE or the TMS.  
 - 
[ASM -25] All information received from the operator panel is relevant for one 
AoC only. This implies that it is not necessary to exchange this 
information between MBS and neighbouring systems.  - 
[ASM -26] The received information about the infrastructure (geographical 
position of tracks, points, etc.) correctly represent physical reality. 
An external controller is responsible for the data validation 
process. Rationale: MBS safety functions depend on this input but 
cannot verify the input ind ependently.  - 
[ASM -27] When train integrity is lost, the main reservoir pipe is vented and 
the train emergency breaks engage.  - 
[ASM -28] Operator informs the MBS, about all regions where a train 
movement has been manually authorised by the operator. This 
also includes situations, where the radio connections to the OBU 
is lost.  -

The responsibilities of MBS essentially comprise the following areas:  
• Assess risk of commands for trains and infrastructure elements. Reject commands, which will 
result in an unsafe situation. Forward or process safety -validated commands.  
• Intervention if risk of railway accidents is not tolerable (e.g., point in reservation area loses its 
end position, train moving too fast, runaway trains, …).  
• Safe communication with trains and field elements  
• Provide an up -to-date, reliable and consistent system view of trains, infrastructure and other 
relevant parties (e.g., level crossings)

5.6.3  Operator  
Concerning the operator, we reiterate two important assumptions here:  
• interaction between the operator and MBS only involves safety related information [ASM -22] 
• other interactions of the operator with the system are done via the PE or the TMS [ASM -23] 
The reason for these assumptions is that the PE and TMS implement the operational processes and 
MBS acts as a gatekeeper that monitors if the risk is tolerable and forwards safe 
commands/authorities.

interfaces. Later in the analysis, these can be explored in greater depth or the respective systems 
can be broken down into smaller controllers/actors.  
A subset of the unsafe control actions was selected for further scenario generation. This was done

Scenarios for unsafe control actions:  
[S1-UCA -OP-1]: Two railway points P1 and P2 report a lost end position and are unable to execute 
throwover commands by the operator. As the railway points are within close proximity, a single 
maintenance team is dispatched to investigate the two points. Th e maintenance team is able to fix 
the position of P1 and reports work completed this to the Operator. The operator mistakenly believes 
the team also fixed the position of point P2, which the team was also tasked to investigate. As a 
result, the operator pr ovides an infrastructure state not matching reality to MBS [UCA -OP-1] 
=> [SDR -1]: Provide an operational rule set which explicitly determines to which infrastructure item 
a completed (safety related) intervention refers/referred to.  
[S2-UCA -OP-2]: When passing a protected level crossing, the train driver notices that the bars on 
one side are not fully closed and reports this to the operator. As this particular level crossing had 
problems in the past, the operator mistakenly believes t hat this was already entered into the operator 
panel. As a result, a required URA is not applied to the MA [UCA -OP-2]. 
=> [SDR -2]: When changes to the operational state are reported by personnel, the operator shall 
always check if they are already entered in the operation state of MBS, even if the operator believes 
this has already been done in the past  
=> [SDR -3]: The operator panel shall provide easily accessible information on all currently manually 
entered infrastructure state with the required confidence for a safety related function.  
[S3-UCA -OP-3]: A construction team is in the field upgrading multiple railway points. The 
construction is scheduled sequentially so that the impact on the railway traffic is minimized. Due to 
unforeseen problems on site, the construction order of the point s is switched and this is reported to 
the operator. As the operators shift ends shortly and the change only affects the next shift, he leaves 
a note for the next shift. When the next shift starts, an operational disturbance keeps the operator

 Interne  busy. As a result, the note concerning the construction schedule is read only after construction has 
already begun and the operator reports the known operational state to MBS too late [UCA -OP-3] 
=> [SDR -4]: The interface for the operator shall allow to pre -schedule usage restriction areas.  
=> [SDR -5]: The operator shift handover shall include either an operational process or digital means 
that prevent a loss of (safety related) information during the handover.  
[S4-UCA -OP-4]: Due to construction work, a temporary usage restriction area with a speed reduction 
shall be established. When entering the speed restriction, the operator makes a typo leading to a 
usage restriction area with an excessive speed limit [UCA -OP-4]. 
=> [SDR -6]: The operator panel should implement procedures to verify the entered usage restriction 
data, before the entered data is passed to the MBS system.  
[S5-UCA -OP-5]: A maintenance team performs work on two tracks T1 and T2 closely located to each 
other. When the team reports that it has completed its work for T1, the operator mistakenly believes 
that the work on both tracks has been completed. As a resul t, the operator revokes the usage 
restriction area for T1 and T2 when it still should be applied for T2 [UCA -OP-5]. 
=> See [SDR -1] and [SDR -3] 
[S6-UCA -OP-6]: The operator receives a report from a train driver that there are leaves on the track 
reducing braking performance. The operator knows a corresponding usage restriction has already 
been entered by the previous shift. However, this usage rest riction has since expired. The operator 
mistakenly believes the usage restriction is still applied and as a result does not provide the usage 
restriction to the operational state of MBS as needed [UCA -OP-6]. 
=> See [SDR -2] and [SDR -3] 
[S7-UCA -OP-7]: An operational disturbance requires the operator to manually manage a large 
number of trains. As the timetable should be upheld as much as possible, the operator is under time 
pressure. In this situation a construction team reports that it will begin constructions on track T1 in 
half an hour. The operator takes note and is immedia tely occupied with train management again. 
Due to time pressure, the operator only follows up on the note after the construction has already 
begun. As a result, the operator provides the usage restriction area for the construction site too late 
to MBS [UCA -OP-7]. 
=> [SDR -7]: Entering usage restriction areas shall take priority over the regular management of 
running trains  
=> see also [SDR -4] 
[S8-UCA -OP-26]: The operator receives a report from the construction team that construction will be 
completed in half an hour. However, unforeseen difficulties on the construction site cause the 
operation to take longer. Emerged in their work the construction team does not report this delay to 
the operator. The operator mistakenly believes that the team has finished their work as planned and 
revokes the usage restriction area too early [UCA -OP-26]. 
=> [SDR -8]: The operator shall always verify with the construction team on site that the work has 
actually been completed before removing the corresponding usage restriction area.  
[S9-UCA -OP-14/17/18]: Similar reasoning to [S7 -UCA -OP-9] (handling of commands under time 
pressure, selecting the wrong train) [UCA -OP-14, UCA -OP-17, UCA -OP-18]

FP2-T13_3 -T-DBA-044-05 Page 53 of 104 07/07/2025 
 
 Interne  [S10-UCA -OP-15]: The Operator wants to stop a train before a danger point. The interface requires 
that the operator enters the stopping position manually. While entering the stopping position, the 
operator makes a typo. As a result, the operator provides a  conditional emergency stop command 
with the wrong position. As the train has already passed this position, the command is ignored by 
the OBU [UCA -OP-15]. 
=> [SDR -9]: The operator panel shall be designed to support the operator with contextual information 
when executing operator commands. I.e. the operator shall be able to select the stopping position 
based on an interface with information about the physical elements/tr ackside assets and select a 
stopping position based on the physical elements position.  
[S11-UCA -OP-16]: The operator receives information that part of a track has become unexpectedly 
occupied. A train currently has a valid MA over the obstructed portion of the track. The operator 
believes the train is still at a large distance from the obstr ucted portion and issues a conditional 
emergency stop. However, the train position report was outdated and the train is already past the 
stopping position for the conditional emergency stop. As a result, the operator fails to provide the 
required unconditi onal emergency stop command. [UCA -OP-16] 
=> [SDR -10]: The operator shall receive a (visual) indication about the reported train position age. 
(e.g., information outdated longer than for a defined threshold should be indicated).

Scenarios for selected unsafe control actions:  
The unsafe control actions [UCA -MBS -16] and [UCA -MBS -17] were selected, as they are closely 
associated with the running path protection, which may be handled differently between fixed block 
and moving block systems.  
[S1-UCA -MBS -16] Train T1 is a train composed of two consists, T1a and T1b, with one OBU per 
consist. The train is initially at standstill, and both consists are unpowered and coupled and no TTDs 
are located at the track. The consists T1a and T1b are uncoup led while the train is powered off. The 
driver enters the cab of T1a, opens the desk and enters the validated train data. He mistakenly 
believes that T1b is still coupled and inputs the total of T1a and T1b as train length into the DMI. As 
the consist T1a is still integer, the TIMS reports integrity confirmed. When PE requests an MA for 
T1a from MBS, MBS mistakenly believes that a train with a length of T1 is moved, while in reality 
train T1b is still standing on the tracks.  As a result, after releasing th e MA behind T1a, MBS grants 
another train T2 a MA into the region where T1b is still standing, leading to a collision [UCA -MBS -
16] 
=> [SDR -11]: MBS shall always be aware when a change of train length is expected (i.e. due to 
splitting and joining).  
[S2-UCA -MBS -16] Train T1 with length LEN1 is initially at standstill and located on track TR1. T1 is 
not equipped with a functioning TIMS and no TTDs are available for TR1. The driver opens the desk 
and enters the validated train data. Due to operational c hanges, additional cars have been added to 
the train. The driver enters a too short train length LEN2, because he is not aware that the train is 
longer than during normal operations. As he is already behind schedule and there are visual 
obstructions blocki ng his view to the end of the train, the driver confirms the train integrity without 
seeing the last train cars. Therefore, MBS mistakenly believes T1 has length LEN2, which is shorter 
than the real train length LEN1, and grants an MA to T1 based on LEN2. As a result, after releasing 
the MA behind T1, MBS grants another train T2 a MA into the region where T1 is still standing, 
leading to a collision [UCA -MBS -16] 
  Contract No. HE – 101102001  
  
 
 
FP2-T13_3 -T-DBA-044-05 Page 60 of 104 07/07/2025 
 
 Interne  => [SDR -12]: If MBS is aware of the expected train length (i.e. by transmitting the expected train 
length together with the train running number from the PE) it shall compare the expected train length 
with the reported train length in the validated train d ata and require addition confirmation if the two 
lengths differ.  
[S3-UCA -MBS -16] Train T1 is initially at parked and located at L1, near the bottom of a valley. The 
train is powered down and no TTDs are available for this section of the track. After applying the 
parking brakes, the railway personal does not add the brak e shoes below the wheels. Therefore, 
after the air pressure is no longer sufficient to keep the train at standstill, T1 starts to move towards 
the bottom of the valley and is now located at L2. MBS mistakenly believes that T1 is still located at 
its last k nown location L1. As a result, MBS grants another train T2 a MA into L2, leading to a collision 
[UCA -MBS -16] 
=> [SDR -13]: In regions where the parking of vehicles is expected, methods for detecting the 
presence of trains independent of train position reports shall be available (i.e. installing TTDs in these 
regions)  
[S4-UCA -MBS -16] Train T1 is initially at standstill and located at L1. T1 is in no power mode and no 
TTDs are available. The driver opens the desk and enters the validated train data. The OBU does 
not know the current train position. The driver therefore t ells the operator the train position, and 
requests a staff responsible movement authorization. However, as the driver cannot see the track 
kilometer board due to visual obstructions, he mistakenly reports the wrong train position L2 to the 
operator. The op erator permits a train movement based on a L2, while the train is in reality located 
at L1. As a result, MBS grants another train T2 a MA into L1, leading to a collision [UCA -MBS -16] 
=> [SDR -14]: When moving a train based on a train position transmitted by the driver, the operator 
shall perform additional validity checks from a second source (i.e. planned start location of the train) 
before granting a SR authorization.  
[S5-UCA -MBS -16]: Light Maintenance vehicle M1 is powered off and located at L1 on track TR1. 
TR1 is equipped with a track circuit TTD1, which is unable to detect the maintenance vehicle M1. At 
MBS initialization, TTD1 is reported as clear. Therefore, MBS i s unaware of the presence of M1 at 
L1. As a result, MBS grants another train T1 a MA into L1, leading to a collision [UCA -MBS -16] 
=> [SDR -15]: When the presence of maintenance vehicles is expected, track circuits alone should 
not be sufficient to clear the track, if these circuits can miss occupations by some vehicle types (i.e. 
light maintenance vehicles). Note: This may adversely impact operational performance at system 
startup or when clearing areas previously occupied by maintenance vehicles.  
[S1-UCA -MBS -17] Train T1 is at standstill and located at the left track of railway point P1. The 
reported train length of LEN1 or T1 is shorter than the physical train length LEN2. Therefore, MBS 
mistakenly assumes that T1 is outside the fouling point of P 1. As a result, MBS grants another train 
T2 a MA over P1, leading to a flank collision between T1 and T2 [UCA -MBS -17] 
=> see [SDR -12] 
[S2-UCA -MBS -17] Unsupervised area UA1 is reachable via the left track of railway point P1. Train 
T1 is located in UA1, and neither the UA1 nor the tracks of P1 are equipped with TTDs. Due to 
degraded braking performance, T1 skids outside the region UA1, an d beyond the fouling point of P1. 
As a result, MBS grants another train T2 a MA over P1, leading to a flank collision between T1 and 
T2 [UCA -MBS -17]

 Interne  => [SDR -16]: Between controlled region and unsupervised region, the movement of non -
communicating trains shall be detectable, i.e. using TTDs, or preventable using a point/derailer 
(similar to [SDR -13]) 
[S3-UCA -MBS -17] Maintenance vehicle M1 located within worksite W1 on track TR1 and equipped 
with a movable crane arm. Track TR2 runs parallel to TR1. If fully extended, the crane arm of M1 
can reach into the maximum permitted clearance gauge TR2. Because w orksite W1 is located on 
TR1, MBS mistakenly believes this worksite cannot affect trains running on TR2. As a result, an MA 
for another train T2 running on TR2 is granted while the crane arm of M1 is extended into TR2, 
leading to a clearance gauge violatio n [UCA -MBS -17].  
=> [SDR -17]: The effects of Maintenance on neighboring tracks shall be taken into account 
(conceptionally, e.g., as function in MBS or as additional TSR with the URA from planning data or 
operator input) when granting a MA.  
[S4-UCA -MBS -17] Train T1 performs end of mission on side Track TR1 which is connected to the 
main track TR2 via point P1. Due to an operational error the train was not protected against roll -
away. After some time, the pressure in the brake tanks drops and the train starts to roll toward P1. 
In the mean -time another MA was granted for Train T2 on the main track TR2 leading over P1. Since 
MBS cannot detect the unexpected occupation on P1 nor the unexpected vacancy of the TTD on T1 
in time, train T1 collides with train T2 leading to a flank collision . 
=> [SDR -18] Simple detection of track occupation is not sufficient to prevent flank collisions in all 
cases. Technical means to secure a sufficiently large vacant area before the  fouling p oint is required.  
[S5-UCA -MBS -17] A side -track TR1 is equipped with TTD and via the point P1 connected to the 
main track TR2. Train T1 and train T3 are both located in the same TTD are on track TR1. Both 
trains have performed end of mission. Due to an operational error trai n T1 was not secured against 
roll-away. After break tank pressure drops, the train T1 rolls toward P1.

Scenarios for selected unsafe control actions:  
[S1-UCA -DR-1/2] DR provides a new set of domain data to MBS which has not been verified to 
comply with the given engineering rules, or which is malformed in other ways. Since no further 
checks are applied on MBS side a data type for the configuration of ra ilway point P1 is misinterpreted 
such that point position “left” actually corresponds to point position “right”. MBS then allows the 
movement of train T1 over point P1 leading to collision or derailment on a side track.

 Interne  -> [SDR -25] DR shall include a set of verification functions that ensure that processed data follows 
the required engineering rules and is not malformed.  
 
[S1-UCA -DR-3] DR provides a new set of domain data to MBS, however the distance between 
railway point P1 and railway point P2 in the data is longer than in reality. MBS is thus not aware that 
the Train T1 is actually reaching over P1 and allows P1 to be sw itched under T1 leading to a 
derailment.  
-> [SDR -19] There shall be a “safety responsible” entity which is in a valid position to verify the 
correctness (correspondence to the physical reality) of the input data for MBS with a certainty 
corresponding to a SIL -4 function . 
 
[S2-UCA -DR-3] DR provides a new set of domain data to MBS that was originally validated by a 
safety responsible according to [SDR -19], however the data was altered in and intermediate 
processing step such that the distance between railway point P1 and railway point P2 is now longer 
than in reality. MBS is thus not aware that the Train T1 is actually reaching over P1 and allows P1 
to be switched under T1 leading to a derailment.  
-> [SDR -20] MBS shall include a function that ensures that the input data (here Domain Data) 
received corresponds exactly to what has been verified and validated by the above (in UCA -DR-1) 
mentioned safety responsible (e.g. by means of a dedicated signature or safety code).  
 
[S1-UCA -DR-4/5] Construction work to shorten a side track was scheduled for a certain date. Due 
to operational changes the actual construction work starts early, and a URA for work site protection 
is created together with the dispatcher. After the construc tion work is finished, the dispatcher lifts the 
worksite URA, although the topography and configuration data in MBS was not yet updated to reflect 
a shorter track. As a result, a train is authorized to enter the side track and collides with the buffer 
stop. 
 
-> [SDR -21] An operational rule may be required, that ensures that any infrastructure changes have 
to be preceded by a (sufficiently large & restrictive) URA, and that this URA may only be lifted if the 
changes have been updated in the topography & configuration data of MBS.  
 
[S1-UCA -DR-11] For some reason it was decided that domain data should be updated before the 
actual construction work on the tracks took place. To secure the area where track changes will occur 
a URA was foreseen. However, MBS was not commanded to activate this URA before the following 
topology/domain data update. Since MBS has no means of deciding if such a URA would have been 
required it activates the new domain data version right away. Subsequently. MBS allows a train to 
move into the site with a higher v elocity than allowed for safe operation. .  
 
=> [SDR -24] If an URA for safe activation of new set of domain data is required the domain data 
shall include the reference for this URA (e.g. by means of a dedicated safety code).

This chapter details the results of the safety analysis of the MBS safety boundary analysis and the 
related interfaces. The aim of this analysis is to identify safety related connections and systems 
relating to the MBS. The MBD shall support different mode s of operation. This chapter analysis these 
modes for the impact to the MBS.

After initialisation (either in planned circumstances or as a consequence of a 
system fault) the Level 3 Trackside has to ascertain the Train Location of all 
vehicles and obstructions in the Area.  
If the L3 Trackside allows for a responsible person to declare Clear Track Status 
Areas, then it is critical that the area is only determined Clear when it is truly clear 
to avoid a Movement Authority into an Occupied Track Status Area, that could 
lead to a collision.

Hazard 
headline  Error in Train Location from reduced confidence interval at End of Mission leads

Hazard 
description  "The L3 Trackside needs to determine the area that could be occupied by a train 
performing End of Mission (EoM) in order to protect it. To that aim, the L3 
Trackside is expected to use the location information received from the train.  
However, as part of the ERA CCM Process an ambiguity in the specifications 
has been identified which makes it unclear how the ETCS On -board calculates 
the confidence interval reported at EoM. This is because linking information, 
including balise location a ccuracy used in the confidence interval, is deleted 
when changing to SB mode.  
If the location accuracy of the LRBG has a larger value than the National Value 
(Q_NVLOCACC) and the ETCS On -board uses the National Value in the EoM 
Position Report, this could lead to a collision if the Unknown Track Status Area 
for protecting the train is unduly shortened, not covering the whole length of the 
train."

Hazard 
headline  Error in Train Location from lack of linking information leading to collision  
Hazard 
description  When relocation is done for a new balise group without linking information 
(Subset -026, 
3.4.4 [BL3 R2]) the ETCS On -board uses the estimated distance travelled 
between the  
previous LRBG and the new LRBG. Next figure illustrates the potential issue that 
arises.  
 
 
 
At time T0 (i.e. the time when the train was last known to be integer), the LRBG 
was BG_A.  
At time T1, BG_B is encountered, the ETCS On -board then relocates the Min 
Safe Rear end at T0 to the new LRBG.  
If linking information is not available or not used, the ETCS On -board then sends 
a position report to the L3 Trackside using the estimated distance between 
BG_A and BG_B when calculating the safe train length.  
If this estimate is shorter than the real distance between BG_A and BG_B, the 
L3 Trackside believe s that the confirmed rear end is closer to BG_A than it 
actually is.  
This means that in case the train has been broken between time T0 and T1, but 
not yet detected by the TIMS device, there could be a part of the train in the 
section of track that was just cleared, but the L3 Trackside is not aware of this.

Potential mitigations:  
The following considerations could be taken as mitigation measures:  
• Hazardous failure rate for CMD to be considered.  
• Use linking reaction for the first expected Balise Group in the linking chain 
when authorising trains to move, which will brake the train if it is not found as 
expected.  
• Use TTD where trains start after NP mode. However, this is not enough on its

 Interne  8 COMPILED DESIGN RECOMMENDATIONS  
This chapter contains the compiled safety design recommendations for the analyzed control loops 
supplemented with rationale, guidance &/or example statements. Although these enriched 
recommendations should be self -explanatory, it might make sense to look u p the linked 
(hypothetical) scenarios for each, that led to unsafe control actions in the chapters above.  
8.1 UNSAFE CONTROL ACTIONS TOWARDS ON BOARD UNIT 
=>[SDR -13]: In regions where the parking of vehicles is expected, methods for detecting the 
presence of trains independent of train position reports shall be available (i.e. installing TTDs in these 
regions)  
Rationale Uncontrolled train movements, like runaway cars after parking, are not constrained by a 
movement authority. Such a scenario is described in [S3 -UCA -MBS -16] 
 
=> [SDR -16]: Between controlled region and unsupervised region, the movement of non -
communicating trains shall be detectable, i.e. using TTDs, or preventable using a point/derailer 
(similar to [SDR -13]) 
Rationale Detecting or preventing the presence of uncontrolled trains out of unsupervised regions 
(e.g. at the borders of the region of control) is needed for assumption 2. A corresponding scenario 
is described in [S2 -UCA -MBS -17]. 
 
=> [SDR -18] Simple detection of track occupation is not sufficient to prevent flank collisions in all 
cases. Technical means to secure a sufficiently large vacant area before the  fouling p oint is required.  
Rationale Even when the train presence is detected according to assumption 1., the reaction times 
can be insufficient to prevent a flank collision hazard, making further measures necessary:  
 
=> [ASM -4-v2] MBS does not require TTDs for controlled train movement but supports them for 
migration purposes or systems where the chance of uncontrolled movement cannot be sufficiently 
controlled by other means.  
Rationale The assumption that TTDs can completely be eliminated while still guarding against all 
loss scenarios found in our analysis is too strong. As long as uncontrolled train movement cannot 
be eliminated, their presence is still required.

FP2-T13_3 -T-DBA-044-05 Page 94 of 104 07/07/2025 
 
 Interne  => [SDR -11]: MBS shall always be aware when a change of train length is expected (i.e. due to 
splitting and joining).  
Rationale If the MBS detects an unexpected difference between the reported and expected train 
length, this could indicate a wrong data input (either by the driver or in the operation plan).  
Example  This can be done e.g. by informing the MBS that splitting or joining is performed via the 
plan execution.  
 
8.2 UNSAFE CONTROL ACTIONS TOWARDS OPERATOR PANEL  
=> [SDR -1]: Provide an operational rule set which explicitly determines to which infrastructure item 
a completed (safety related) intervention refers/referred to.  
Rationale Since safety functions of MBS directly depend on the correctness of its operational state, 
special care has to be taken where a human operator is allowed to issue safety related commands 
or settings.  
 
=> [SDR -2]: When changes to the operational state are reported by personnel, the operator shall 
always check if they are already entered in the operation state of MBS, even if the operator believes 
this has already been done in the past  
Rationale  as above.  
 
=> [SDR -3]: The operator panel shall provide easily accessible information on all currently manually 
entered infrastructure state with the required confidence for a safety related function.  
Rationale  The operator shall have a means to reproduce origin and the reliability of the presented 
data.  
 
=> [SDR -4]: The interface for the operator shall allow to pre -schedule usage restriction areas.  
Rationale  In order to avoid secondary (possibly non -SIL systems) tools, or even pen & paper 
solutions the system shall include safe and transparent means for pre -scheduling.  
 
=> [SDR -5]: The operator shift handover shall include either an operational process or digital means 
that prevent a loss of (safety related) information during the handover.  
Guidance  Ideally all relevant information as well as the handover - procedure itself are foreseen in 
the operator panel/system.  
Example  Whenever the operator confirms a (safety related) request from any other stakeholder, this 
confirmation shall contain a token (e.g., safety code) either from MBS or a trustworthy operator panel, 
guaranteeing that the said intervention is either already in  place or dependably pre -scheduled.   
 
=> [SDR -6]: The operator panel should implement procedures to verify the entered usage restriction 
data, before the entered data is passed to the MBS system.  
  Contract No. HE – 101102001  
  
 
 
FP2-T13_3 -T-DBA-044-05 Page 95 of 104 07/07/2025 
 
 Interne  Rationale  Since the operator is still a human being, additional procedures to verify the inputs are 
recommended.  
=> [SDR -7]: Entering usage restriction areas shall take priority over the regular management of 
running trains  
Rationale  E.g., a usage restriction that was issued to late is a safety risk.  
Guidance  Maybe an even more general prioritization of tasks could be implemented. The life -cycle 
of URAs -> is a design decision potentially influencing multiple systems.  
 
=> [SDR -8]: The operator shall always verify with the construction team on site that the work has 
actually been completed before removing the corresponding usage restriction area.  
Rationale  Again, possibly safety related information from/through human beings needs to be re -
checked by adequate processes and rules.   
 
=> [SDR -9]: The operator panel shall be designed to support the operator with contextual information 
when executing operator commands. I.e. the operator shall be able to select the stopping position 
based on an interface with information about the physical elements/tr ackside assets and select a 
stopping position based on the physical elements position.  
Rationale  With processes that have a “human in the loop” also the feedback to this human – e.g., 
its readability and its correctness - may have safety implications.  
 
=> [SDR -10]: The operator shall receive a (visual) indication about the reported train position age. 
(e.g., information outdated longer than for a defined threshold should be indicated).  
Rationale  Edge cases that result from timing interrelation (e.g., max. GSM -R signal roundtrip) in the 
greater system need to be – at least - visible to the operator.  
 
8.3 UNSAFE CONTROL ACTIONS TOWARDS TRACKSIDE ASSESTS CONTROL &

 Interne  8.4 UNSAFE CONTROL ACTIONS REGARDING DOMAIN DATA & UPDATES  
=> [SDR -25] DR shall include a set of verification functions that ensure that processed data follows 
the required engineering rules and is not malformed.  
Rationale  as with [SDR -19]. 
 
=> [SDR -19] There shall be a “safety responsible” entity which is in a valid position to verify the 
correctness (correspondence to the physical reality) of the input data for MBS with a certainty 
corresponding to a SIL -4 function . 
 
Rationale With the concept of a “generic” Safety Logic the functional behavior of MBS depends on 
the correctness (conformity with physical reality) of its input topography - and configuration data (here 
Domain Data) from an external source.  
 
Guidance  This is a nonnegligible advantage over past and current approaches (see Figure 9). For 
example, MBS allows for much greater flexibility with regards to setting MAs instead of relying on 
pre-defined routes. However, since MBS cannot verify that correspondence to physical reality by 
itself, an exported requirement demanding proof, as we ll as a clear path of responsibility shall be 
established.  
  
Figure 9: Generic Safety Logic  
 
=> [SDR -20] MBS shall include a function that ensures that the input data (here Domain Data) 
received corresponds exactly to what has been verified and validated by the above (in UCA -DR-1) 
mentioned safety responsible (e.g. by means of a dedicated signature or safety code).  
Rationale If there are intermediaries between the entity that validated the input data for MBS and 
MBS itself, then a method is required to assure that the data has not been altered/changed in 
between.  
 
Example  The following figure shows how such a tracing of the safety responsibility for new 
topography and configuration data could be implemented. In this case the responsibility lies with the 
engineering data supplier:  

  Contract No. HE – 101102001

 Interne   
Figure 10: Example for tracing of safety responsibility for topography & configuration data  
 
=> [SDR -21] An operational rule may be required, that ensures that any infrastructure changes have 
to be preceded by a (sufficiently large & restrictive) URA, and that this URA may only be lifted if the 
changes have been updated in the topography & configuration data of MBS.  
 
Rationale MBS lacks the information to verify that the URAs are sufficiently restrictive for the 
infrastructure change to be safely performed. This verification must therefore be performed by other 
means, e.g. an operational rule.  
 
=> [SDR -22] There shall be a “safety responsible” entity which is in a valid position to define a 
(sufficiently large & restrictive) URA which covers the area in said AoC which is about to change 
during the upcoming data (Domain Data) update. Again, with a certainty c orresponding to a SIL -4 
function.  
 
Rationale  Similar to the correctness of topography and configuration for normal operations, it is 
paramount that the URA covering the area that is about to change during an update (of Domain 
Data) is sufficiently large and correct.  
 
Alternative  MBS could have a capability that allows to derive the delta between the current and the 
uploaded new/next Domain data update. However, a separate (and safe) concept on how to derive 
a sufficiently large URA would be required.

 Interne  => [SDR -23] MBS shall include a function that ensures that the received URA corresponds exactly 
to what was defined by the aforementioned safety responsible (e.g. by means of a dedicated safety 
code).  
 
Rationale  If there are intermediaries between the entity that defined the URA and MBS itself, then 
a method is required to assure that the data has not been altered/changed in between.  
Example  Similarly, the engineering data supplier could also provide the extent/type of the required 
URA, even though it is then timed/initiated through TMS/PE:  
 
Figure 11: Example for tracing of safety responsibility for update URA  
 
Finally, MBS would only have to check if the URA is in place before activating the update within itself:

=> [SDR -24] If an URA for safe activation of new set of domain data is required the domain data 
shall include the reference for this URA (e.g. by means of a dedicated safety code).  
 
Rationale  MBS (or DR if designed with sufficient SIL) shall be able to decide if the required 
precautions were taken before activating a new version of domain data.

 Interne  9 SAFETY  RESULTS  & CONCLUSION  
9.1 STRUCTURE OF THE RESULTS  
The results of this document are presented in three separate chapters:  
Chapter 6  “Interface Criticality” contains the analysis of the safety relevance of the interfaces 
connected directly to the MBS. The neighbouring system is specified in the name of the interface 
(e.g.: I_DR is the interface between the MBS and the DR). An analysis with respect to the correctness 
and integrity of the data as well as the availability of the connection was also conducted for each 
interface. The following interface are listed as safety related: I_AS, I_OBU, I_OP, I_TACS.  
 
Chapter 7  “Mapping of X2Rail Safety Analysis” covers the safety analysis results [X2RAIL -5] of the 
project X2RAIL to ensure that they are adequately considered in this analysis. This is done by 
analyzing each hazard from the X2Rail results and by providing a trace to different artefacts of the 
STPA analysis. It can be stated that the X2RAIL results - where applicable (not bound to a S2R 
specific solution) - are fully covered by the artifacts (e.g. assumptions, design recommendations, 
interface analysis, ... ) from this task.  
 
Chapter 8  “Compiled Design Recommendations” contains the results of the risk analysis in Chapter 
5 above, supplemented with rationale, guidance & example statements where applicable. Although 
these enriched recommendations should be self -explanatory, it makes sense  to look up the linked 
unsafe control actions in the chapters above. They describe how such a hypothetical scenario could 
have occurred and form the background for the recommendations.  
 
9.2 STARTING POINT 
The basis for this analysis was the rough system architecture that is baked into the grant agreement 
as well as various sources from previous projects (see chapter 3). However, essential inputs from 
system pillar were not available at the time. Thus, an own list of assumptions (see chapter 5.5) was 
created, compared, mapped, and supplemented with a similar list from the system definition task 
(13.1). Similarly, the operational context was rather compiled and derived from st ate-of-the-art 
procedures in the participating railway companies than given from the normative side. Another factor 
shaping the work in this task, were the resources at hand, and the parallelized work structure given 
through the grant agreement.

 Interne  9.3 POSITIONING AND OBJECTIVES  
Overall, the undertaking in this task can best be compared to step 3 in the classic V -Cycle from the 
CENELEC norms.  
 
Figure 13: CENELEC V -Cycle  
The first part of the original objectives stated in the grant agreement "a nalysis of the impact of the 
system pillar inputs " was not feasible due to a lack of the inputs regarding the concepts and the 
operational context. But the missing inputs were substituted from other sources as stated in 9.2. The 
results of this task can conversely serve as input for the ongoing discussio n in the system pillar.  
Due to limited time and resources, the authors decided to focus on system hazards, by analyzing 
the control interactions between the moving block system and the systems with which it interfaces 
directly. The chosen method is explained and exemplified in ch apter 5.  
We expect that the results can be utilized to update the system concepts, the system definition as 
well as the operational context and then further the system specification for the continuing innovation 
pillar work on the Moving Block Demonstrator. Some of  the results can also be exported adjacent 
work packages, like WP27 where the Digital Register is being specified, or to the demonstrator work 
packages WP44/45 where operational concepts, and an operator console/workbench will come into 
play.  
Even though a proof of completeness with respect to functional safety is not in part of this task, we 
were able to show that we cover the whole set of results from X2Rail safety work in chapter 7.  
 
9.4 DISCUSSION OF MAIN RESULTS  
An advantage of the chosen approach was that it allowed to connect the beforehand stated 
assumptions with the relevant loss scenarios they affect. Some of the used assumptions were well 
established (e.g., the SIL classification of the OBU, OCs), while othe rs were relatively novel (e.g.,

 Interne  not requiring TTDs for detection of train presence). The safety analysis therefore provided an 
opportunity to validate or - if necessary - update these assumptions.  
For example, under the assumption that TTDs are not required ([ASM -4]), we generated loss 
scenarios for the relevant unsafe control actions to see if the hazard could still be prevented. This is 
closely connected to two further assumptions about MBS:  
1. Up to date knowledge of all (potential) train positions on the tracks  
2. Ability to constrain all train movement within a known area (i.e., movement authority)  
The respective set of loss scenarios (concerning runaway wagons, loss of communication, parking 
vehicles and so on) led to the specific design recommendations [SDR -13], [SDR -16] & [SDR -18]. 
The summary of those in turn leads to the conclusion, that the ass umption that TTDs can completely 
be eliminated while still guarding against all loss scenarios found in our analysis is too strong. In 
short, if uncontrolled train movement cannot be eliminated, their presence is still required. 
Henceforth, [ASM -4] was upd ated to [ASM -4-v2] “MBS does not require TTDs for controlled train 
movement but supports them for migration purposes or systems where the chance of uncontrolled 
movement cannot be sufficiently controlled by other means. ” 
 
A second class of assumptions is concerned with the correspondence between reported data and 
physical reality. This includes assumptions about the reported train length ([ASM -8]) as well as the 
geographical position of infrastructure elements like points, tracks, etc. ([ASM -26]). For train length, 
partial validation is possible in the case of splitting or joining trains. However, the validation alone 
may not be sufficient to achieve the desired level of confidence required for a SIL 4 function (e.g., if 
two trains enter the same TTD section and maneuvers like joining, splitting, or turning take place). 
Thus [SDR -11] states that “ MBS shall always be aware when a change of train length is expected 
(i.e. due to splitting and joining) .” 
The correctness of information on the geographical position of infrastructure elements is even more 
critical for MBS. Some controller constraints depend on geometrical information (e.g. ensuring that 
there are no intersections between movement authorities,  [Resp -MBS -1]) which need the required 
level of precision to ensure that no intersections are undetected. MBS lacks the information to 
validate the provided information by itself, but depends on it for SIL -4 functions. Thus, the 
corresponding assumption [A SM-26] has the rank of exported requirement, provided in a higher level 
of granularity through the design recommendations [SDR -18] to [SDR -24]. 
 
The third class of results concerns the control loops where a human actor is involved. Several design 
recommendations in section 8.4 concern the Operator Panel, its ability to display safety related 
information, to re -verify human entered values, to schedu le safety related commands, or more 
general operational procedures that could be linked to respective loss scenarios in our analysis.  
 
9.5 OPEN POINTS AND FUTURE WORK 
Even though the major pain points were likely highlighted in this analysis, they are not yet verifiably 
settled or solved. In that regard, the design recommendations will have to be considered in the 
system definitions of MBS, DR and the Operator Panel - to be then re -checked/validated in a further

 Interne  step of the safety analysis (e.g., protection against side -on collisions; domain data safety responsible 
entity).  
Some of the assumptions defined at the beginning of the work packages simplified the analysis and 
might have to be re -opened in a later stage when extending the system scope (e.g., SIL of train 
length / train integrity information; handover to neighboring MBS - or legacy systems). Finally, there 
are some use -cases that were postponed to a later stage of the demonstrator (e.g., supervised 
shunting) that must be analyzed as soon as first concept drafts are available.  
The results of the safety analysis review from D13.1 will be further developed and addressed within 
WP14. Regarding any form of proof of completeness, e.g., for a later certification will likely have to 
move to a possible second phase of the R2DATO project.
