EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Computers are ubiquitous and their number is increasing, and the railway sector is no different. A
huge amount of computing platforms is needed today, and even more will be needed in the future。
are essentialin on-board systems, trackside elements and in data centres for efficient, reliable;
and
safe operation。
By increasing the
automation
in
the railway infrastructure including fully
automated trains, new requirements and expectations towards these platforms will arise and add
complexity, while the goal of safety must never be in jeopardy.
Supporting this growth in complexity and sheer number of computing systems and platforms, this
Work package, supported by railway companies and industry partners, aims to define a specification
for modular platforms and deliver it to the ERJU System Pillar and future Innovation Pillar activities。
Based on the consolidated learnings of the work package's first task and the intermediate deliverable
of the second task,
this third deliverable provides the specification
for the "Modular Platforms
Concept" (MPC).
The purpose of the MPC is to provide an up to SIL4 capable computing platform that enables the
decoupling of hardware and software lifecycles and their respective update cycles. The MPC allows
extensions to systems, updates;
re-USe
of previous developments
and consolidation of
more
Software on less hardware_
This deliverable achieves the specification of the MPC by presenting the concept itself and providing
a consolidated set of high-level platform requirements, collected from previous work, and updated to
align with ERJU work。
The MPC architecture is presented, introducing three different domains to
help with the complexity of the topic: The Application-Level Platform Independence (ALPI) domain
with
3
strong
fOCUS
On
Software
and
runtime
environments,
the
Hardware-Level
Platform
Independence (HLPI) domain
focusing on hardware abstraction and virtualisation aspects, and the
internal and external interfaces
providing interoperability to the outside and adaptability on the
inside of the MPC。
For each of the domains, a thorough discussion of its aspects and resulting
requirements are presented.
The detailed analysis of the topics also resulted in an explicit list Of open points that need further
technical investigations and clarification
for example in demonstration projects
and, in some
cases, more detailed input from the ERJU System Pillar domain than currently available.
As of today, the MPC specification cannot be implemented immediately in a way that would reach
its goals, due to the many important interchangeability details still being worked on in ERJU。
Nevertheless;
together
with
te
future
results
Of
WOrk
package 36
(the
on-board
platform
demonstrator);
the ERJU Innovation Pillar FP2
R2DATO" will be able to showcase its vision of
railway modular compute platforms on a solid foundation。
This deliverable concludes task 2
Of work package 26.
Modular certification approaches Will be
discussed in task 3

INTRODUCTION
This document; inside the framework of the R2DATO project, provides the detailed specification on
Modular Platforms developed in the Task 26.2.
The objective of the activities in WP26 are to obtain: i) a Modular Platform independent from the
applied functions, and i) a platform that can be introduced into the railway environment on-board
and
wayside。
One of the objectives of this work is to consolidate the Modular Platform definition describing its
architecture and the interactions between the different modules that compose i
The activities that produced the document are the continuation Of this
work package's existing
deliverables, previous projects such as RCAOCORA, Shift2Rail and others. See chapter 2.3 for
details on input documents used。
The partners involved in this project have leveraged their extensive skills and expertise acquired
over the years, including their contributions to previous projects and the development of proprietary
platforms。
As a result, they have collaborated to create a comprehensive summary, the details of
Which are outlined in this document。
The goal followed is to define the basis for providing a Modular Platform that allows to implement
Functional Systems in
3
platform independent manner (HLPI), and also Functional Applications
(ALPI) So that Business Logic is agnostic as much as possible about complexity of HW, Safety;
Security and that can be used for Safe and Non-Safe functions and is
applicable for wayside and
on-board systems。
Furthermore
the Modular Platform enables aggregating systems Of different
Vendors on same COTS hardware.
Within R2DATO,
the
Modular Platform Concept discussed in deliverable 026.3
are relevant for
migrating existing products as well as new functionalities, due to their need of regular updates and
more advanced computational needs。
These fields of applicability will need investigation in a future
phase of R2DATO, though. This work package focuses in the current phase on the use of standard
COTS components。
The workin this deliverable unifies on-board and wayside use cases as much as possible. However,
there
are
environmental constraints
like
available
Volume
and
climate  conditions, leading to
differences in size and available computing resources in
a typical system。 In the end no major
impacts on the basic concept have been identified in this deliverable, even though on-board and
wayside realisations may choose partly different solutions depending on their specific needs and
their technical and normative constraints。
The deliverable describes the approach for a suitable Modular Platform by describing the goals and
concept in detail, presenting an updated set of high-level requirements for such a platform, deriving
an architectural basis, and detailing out three main components of the concept: application-level
platform independence, hardware-level platform independence, and necessary interfaces。
1.1 SCOPE

Toavoid further delayand ensure a viable result before the deadline M23 of WP26 , the work package
team started work on the basis of these deliverable and draft documents, establishing the potential
gap with the intended WP26 results。
2.4 METHODOLOGY FOR DELIVERABLE DEVELOPMENT
The deliverable 026.3
as the Successor of 026.2 can be considered as the fnal consolidation of
Specifications for the wave one of R2DATO.
This Work group relies on previous deliverables e.9.
from X2RAILand OCORA.In parallel, inputs were also sourced through diverse SP Task 2 domains。
These became the fundamental inputs to start the process of input collection.
Atthe beginning of the activities a DDP (Deliverable Development Plan ) was developed and agreed
byall the partners, i Was followed for the 026.3 writing activities.
The work carried out in Task 26.2 involved the study of the results obtained in previous projects。
Without prejudice to the Valid work carried out in the previous projects, a series of points have been
highlighted by the WP26 partners which are reported below:
Identify suitable solutions;
Try to reuse experience coming from specific partners;
Integrate the parts coming from previous projects that were considered stable;
Find a compromise between complexity and feasibility;
Try to provide solutions that do not favour a specific partnerlprovider;
Be able to have an application-independent solution;
reuse of available standard COTS products on the
market; taking full advantage of the
evolution of ICT and OTtechnologies。
Once
these activity development points have been identified,
the first step
WaS to define the
operational aspects in Which the Modular Platform shall operate。
After the chapters
were drafted, the Workgroup followed a structured approach from the point of
drafting the chapters to finalizing of the deliverable with the required consensus and approval. In line
with the DDP the following steps illustrate this process:
1.
First development stage
responsibility of partner writing the chapters;

3 MODULAR PLATFORMS CONCEPT (MPC)
The concept for modular platforms as presented in this deliverable enables interchangeability and
maintainability for railway computing applications and the platforms they are deployed
On
The
concept is agnostic to trackside and on-board use, targets COTS hardware and integrates workloads
With different criticality
basic integrity up to SIL4.
The results created by R2DATO work package 26 are based on several inputs. Previous work has
already been captured in the first deliverable [18], and an intermediate version of the concept has
been introduced in the second deliverable [19]. The basic architectural concepts, however, are taken
directly from the ERJU System Pillar Computing Environment Domain deliverables ([14],[15], see
the discussion in chapter 3.7)
and
are
not developed in
Work package 26.
Work package
26,
however, decided to treat all defined interfaces with similar priority for this deliverable , extending our
scope. Nevertheless, there has been and still is a constant expert exchange between work package
26 and the Computing Environment Domain.
The subchapters present the Modular Platform Concept's (MPC) purpose, scope,
stakeholders
goals & non-goals, assumptions, and known issues and limitations。
The alignment with the ERJU
System Pillar activities is discussed in detail , including the glossary (see chapter 3.7.2) that has been
developed in alignment with the SP CE domain.
Details on the handling of PRAMSS in MPC are
stated. Based on ERJU System Pillar input, user stories, and operational context and scenarios are
given. The intended usage for the MPC and exemplary platform environments are discussed last。
The following three chapters will discuss in detail the important puzzle pieces ofthe Modular Platform
Concept,
namely
hardware-level platform independence
(HLPI)
in chapter 6
application-level
platform independence (ALPI) in chapter 7 and platform management interfaces in chapter 8.
Additional terms introduced for the MPC can be found in the glossary in Appendix F
3.1 PURPOSE
The Modular Platform Concept is an extension of the ERJU System Pillar Computing Environment
architecture proposal. The purpose of the Modular Platform Concept (MCP)
and of work package
26
is to explore the feasibility Of the following items and educate other R2DATO work packages
and the System Pillar about MPC to foster its adaptation and integration.
MPC-POI
The decoupling of hardware and software lifecycles, leading to the decoupling of their
respective update cycles。
MPC_PO2
The decoupling of software with different lifecycles, such as security related components,
services like diagnostics, base software, and applications。
MPC_PO3
Providing
3
generic
and
basic framework
for
future
Basic  Integrity
UP
to
SIL4
applications。
MPC-PO4
Enabling the extension of functionality to
an already deployed
modular platform,
for
example adding ATO to an existing CCS after initial deployment。
MPC-PO5
Enabling re-Use
For example,
a diagnostics stack, e.9. as defined in EULYNX [2], can
be used in different projects. Also, the need to deploy and maintain multiple variants of
the same function can be reduced.
MPC_PO@
Consolidating more software on less hardware。

MPC-PO7
Shaping a picture of the feasibility, scenarios, and benefits around potential multi-vendor
approaches (spanning

Software), including
functional safety applications.
3.2 SCOPE
The MPC is a generic approach to computing, embedded in a railway landscape。
As such, it can
potentially cover wayside and rolling stock systems。
As these environments might have specific requirements towards computing systems, the following
scope limitations are necessary.
MPC_SOI
Wayside and on-board are to betreated equally where possible. Where differences are
encountered,
he
more
encompassing Variant guides the definition of the MPC, with
potential simplifications stated.
MPC_SO3
The MPC as defined in here is not intended to achieve full compatibility to allor even
specific existing applications。
3.3 STAKEHOLDERS
Within ERJU, there are several stakeholders for the MPC.
The ERJU System Pillar Computing Environment domain delivering the basis and analysing
the work package 26 results
Other ERJU System Pillar domains with interfaces towards or interest in the MPC
The work package 26 members
ERJU R2DATO,
in particular the on-board platform demonstrator (R2DATO work package
36) as a potential specification consumer, validator, and feedback instance
R2DATO Wave-2 work packages for the potential continuation (e.9. continuation in R2DATO,
e.9., future in demonstrators) and other prototying projects
3.4 GOALS & NoNGOALS
For this deliverable on the MPC specification, the work package defined several goals and also
explicit non-goals。
MPCGOI
eoal: Create
3
basic and initial technical reference respectively feasibility study for
railway-grade modular platforms. Target audience: IMs, RUs, Industry. Focus questions:
Where are the pain points?
What are needs and benefits from standardization in a technical context?
What would need to be agreed on from a technical perspective to enable the concept?
MPC_@0z
Q@al: Create
a
basic set of requirements (for the layers respectively interfaces and
between them) and suggestions how to evaluate them (potentially in R2DATO Wave-2)
This is not going to be covered in this deliverable, but is rather the topic for the subsequent task 3 of work package 26.
The contents of this deliverable Will be an input to the activity, however。

3.5 ASSUMPTIONS
The MPC is based on several assumptions that were compiled by the work package members。
MPC_AOI
The
R2DATO
Grant
Agreement
describes
an
MPC
that
is fully agnostic
to
its
environment, so that all combinations on all systems are captured. For the actual work
of this work package, the scope is assumed to be trackside and on-board systems with
independent lifecycles of software and hardware.
MPC-AO2
The MPC is based on the System Pillar Computing Environment domain architecture
concept [14], its glossary (see chapter 3.7.2) and first insights out of their Work
On
operational scenarios [15] as available by
2024.
MPC_AO3
The MPC's interfaces provide the same functionality, independent of the technologies
Used.
The Functional Systems state
a
Clear demand
on resources needed for their
execution (memory, processing time; IO..)
MPC-AO4
Functional Applications can assume to be free from unintended interference (from each
other, and other parts of the MPC):
Rationale: Memory & instruction corruption, and
similar effects, are not allowed to happen unrecognized。
MPC_AOS
Execution of safe and non-safe functions in mixed critically conditions
on the
Same
hardware is possible.
MPC-AO@
Standardized

certification  approaches

the
MPC
Will
be
investigated in Work package 26 task 3
MPC-AOT
Resource partitioning shall only drive availability and security requirements but not safety
requirements in the VE (Virtualization Environment) Rationale: |O access towards the
hardware
from the compartment is needed,
e.g, to
acCeSS
Ethernet controller。
Resources can be memory, processing time, and IO. This is true forall SIL and Bl cases。

MPC_AIO
Composite fail safety (as defined by EN50129) is used in the MPC
3.6 KNOWN ISSUES & LIMITATIONS
Some aspects Of the MPC are not going to be solved by this deliverable. These known issues and
limitations are listed in this section.
A
potential solution option is given Where known.
MPCLOI
Safe reaction times are set on system level and need to be budgeted to the participating
functions that are implemented on a Modular Platform. This budgeting cannot be solved
on the Modular Platform level, as such
we cannot derive a universal number for the
needed safe reaction time that is true for all possible scenarios. Timings nevertheless
must be specified for actual implementations later to enable the purposes stated for the
MPC. This information can potentially become
ofthe ERJU architecture, apportioned
for the individual functions (e.9.,as already donein EULYNX). Ifnew applications impose
reaction times that are beyond the scope of the MPC,
a re-evaluation is necessary。
Potentially impacted components of the MPC: time stamping, voting, message passing,
and others
Solution Optione: discussion in work package 26 task 3; bring issue to System Pillar (SP);
USe
working assumption of 0.5 up to
1
seconds; Use
EULYNX numbers as an initial
working hypothesis。
MPC-LO2
Modular certification to enable all multi-vendor scenarios is not solved right now。
Solution_Optione: discussion in work package 26 task 3; wait for SP PRAMS domain
results。
MPCLO3
The benefits analysis depends on potential future
demonstration activities (e.9.
in
R2DATO phase 2) of the MPC as presented in this deliverable
MPC-LO4
Requirements towards the platform from applications in the R2DATO and ERJU context
are missing.
Solution Optione: Re-visit in R2DATO phase 2 when application needs are clearer。
MPCLOS
Specific hardware acceleration for ML applications is excluded and for future work。
3.7 ALIGNMENT WITH ERJU SYSTEM PILLAR ACTIVITIES
The Europe's
Rail Joint Undertaking (ERJU) System
Pillar (SP) Computing Environment (CE)
domain is working
on modular computing environments for the railway。
The domain's goal is a
holistic top-down approach, staying agnostic to implementation details
and especially towards
This number in isolation is not helpful for the Modular Platform specification. It is a budgeting issue from the system level
to
appropriate the reaction times across participating systems. See known issue MPC-LO1 in chapter 3.6 for a detailed
discussion.

deliverables:
"Recommendation on interfaces to be standardised" [14] (referred to as "RIS" in this chapter) and
"Operational Analysis Specification (OAS)" [15]. Furthermore, the domain is maintaining the glossary
(see later in this document's chapter 3.7.2). Both_documents_and the algned_glossaryare_Crucjal
inputs for the Modular Platform Concept in Work package 26 and build its basis
Other domains of relevance are the SP Transversal CCS (TCCS) domain and the SP PRAMSS
domain. The alignment is captured in dedicated subchapters。
3.7.1
ERJU SP CE domain: RIS
The RIS [14] derived computing-relevant user stories from the "Common Business Objectives"
provided by the System Pillar [16]. In summary, the user stories are asking for advanced functionality
not available in today's railway- or on-board infrastructure, such as remote updates or hardware
replacement with minimal (re-)certification effort (see
also chapter 3.9).
The
USer stories
Were
assessed towards their benefits. Subsequently, an architecture Was derived, together with a set of
five interfaces named |1 to |5 (see below in Figure 2)
The interfaces are as followS:
1: External Diagnostics, Logging, Orchestration & IT Security Interface
IF-DIAGNOSTICS
IF-LOGGING
IF-ORCHESTRATION
IF-IT-SEC
12: Hardware Abstraction Interface
13: Virtualisation Interface
14: Basic Integrity Platform Independence Interface
15: Safe Platform Independence Interface
In its initial planning, WP26 did not address resp. expect working on hardware and virtualization
topics (12 and |3). Nevertheless, to reach a useful description level for a Modular Platform Concept
following the input from the SP CE domain,
it is necessary to include those, at least by defining
assumptions and requirements (see chapter 6 for this new topic):
Several deployment options based on the architecture and the interface definition were given as
examples。
These examples are illustrated in Figure 3, showing five ways how the layers could be
used, or their functionality included into solutions spanning multiple interfaces.
In a next step, user stories were mapped to these interfaces and a feasibility assessment per story
was conducted, giving individual analyses for basic integrity and SIL applications before deriving an
overall feasibility conclusion. Individual cost assessments on all five interfaces were the next step。
3 For example_
SO far, the SP CE domain did not touch
on on-board specifics, such
as |0 needs and interfacing to
specialized hardware that would still be considered COTS, albeit not in the form of "standard servers
as there are standard
hardware systems from some
suppliers available. Another example could be Subset 147, Which is Ethernet based, needed
for on-board systems in the future and likely to be supported by the same specialized COTS hardware。

ERJU SP CE domain: Glossary
The goal of the Modular Platforms Glossary is to establish a common understanding of the terms
used in this document and within the context of modular computing platforms in ERJU . This ongoing
process of alignment and term definition
is informed by
OUI
previous deliverables 026.1[18],
026.2 [19], and the SP CE domain Glossary (as found in [15]). In cases where We were not aware
ofan existing definition, any additional content included here should be considered as input to the
SP CE domain and other relevant areas。
We recognize the alignment and development of a comprehensive glossary as a crucial activity for
the successful implementation of modular platforms。

Updale: Scenarios for changing of different in-place elements
Recovery: Reactions to different failure scenarios.
The operational scenarios are used later in this document to derive requirements for the internal

3.8.1
Safety
For a modular computing platform that targets applications like interlockings, functional safety is a
property that influences almost every aspect of the concept presented here. Even if the MPC is used
in scenarios Where only Basic Integrity software is necessary, there are still requirements to be
fulfilled from a regulatory standpoint, especially x modularity concepts are used.
Therefore;
the MPC will enable most of its advantages 讦 its embedded into a
modular safety
certification approach。
As per the MPC purpose MPC-P03 and assumption MPC-AO5,
all safety
integrity levels ranging from Basic Integrity up to SIL 4 are to be supported , with the expectation that
Functional Systems almost always Will contain elements with different SIL requirements。
While the concept presented here takes into accountall needs that arise from a potential standards-
compliant implementation of the MPC, the scope of Task 2 of work package 26
Which is the context
for this deliverable
is not including a full safety analysis。
A study on modular platform certification
is the topic for the Work package's Task 3,
Which will document its findings in deliverable 026.4. The
expectation there is to align With the work of the SP PRAMSS domain, see chapter 3.7.5.
In the meantime, insights into how to approach modular safety for state-of-the-art systems can, for
example, be found in the "SIL4 Cloud" [3] and "SIL4 Data Center" [4] research reports。
For a layered architecture With FS compartments of different safety levels running aggregated on a
virtualization environment, is essential to define the safety architecture and to identify the safety
related requirements
Which
arise by SW based SE running on
COTS hardware, for this
See
chapter 6.7.
3.8.2
Security
For modular platforms, appropriate cybersecurity approaches need to be identified that match their
needs
In general,all relevant interfaces and layers of the modular platforms architecture have a
need for special cybersecurity requirements。
Within
the
System
Pillar the
cyber security
domain
is responsible
for the high
level security
architecture and requirements which includes and are applicable to the modular platform。

3.10 OPERATIONAL CONTEXT AND OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS
The SP CE domain
OAS" deliverable [15],as introduced in chapter 3.7.3 , discusses the operational
context and several operational scenarios based on the terminology given in chapter 3.7.2 and the
basic ideas from their first deliverable; "RIS" [14],as introduced in chapter 3.7.1.
A
general assumption for both, operational context and scenarios, is, that the activities are focused
on Functional Systems。
This is a result of the SP CE domain's "main objective of standardising the
Computing Environment [ . . .] to enable the operation of Functional Systems from various suppliers
on a shared pool of physical computing resources" [15]. Depending on the needs of the FS,
35
documented in its FS deployment rules (FSDR), different scenarios are given as examples for their
configuration. These needs depend on requirements towards availability , redundancy, and additional
safety related measures。
1.
FS (#1) implementing a 2-out-of-3 redundancy configuration using three compartments。
The
compartments each need to be run on a distinct piece of physical hardware.

3.11 INTENDED USAGE SCENARIOS
Fora discussion around usage scenarios for the MPC, two cases must be differentiated: The usage
of the Modular Platform Concept (as described in this deliverable) and the usage of actual platform
implementations compatible to the MPC (CPI
compatible platform implementation).
MPCUsageScenarios
The MPC can be used to implement platforms that are compatible to the principles as outlined in this
deliverable.
As
the
deliverable
itself is
not
3
directly implementable specification,
additional
subsequent steps are necessary for full standardization of the relevant interfaces to unlock the
potential benefits described in the previous chapters。
Nevertheless, to research the feasibility of the MPC, the information and design proposals from this
deliverable can be used to guide future work. Especially for the highly recommended
as per
RIS [14]
interfaces for the operation of compartments (12,|3) and the integration of CPI into a
bigger ITIOT landscape (11), prototypes can be built on this deliverable, enhancing the specification。
The MPC itself can also be used as a basis for the definition of prototypes and demonstrators, such
as the work package 36 "On-board Platform Demonstrator.
CPIUsageScenarios Examples
As the MPC is one unified concept, various implementations of the MPC (referred to as CPl, see
above) are possible and are expected to be tailored to their use case and environment
Example
types of CPIare given here, without the list being exhaustive:
Platforms for small , on-premises trackside data centres thatare used to operate interlockings

Platforms for medium sized,
centralized trackside data centres that are used to operate
multiple interlockings
Platforms for larger, centralized trackside data centres that are used to operate multiple
interlockings from diverseareas, potentially also offering georedundacy for other data centres
Platforms for consolidated on-board functionality, especially in CCS
areas Were frequent
updates are to be expected or functionality will be added later in the lifecycle
There are of course smaller scenarios where the MPC in general might not be suitable;
e.9., for
single object controllers and similar single-function, potentially embedded systems. Here; CPIs are
not expected to be available。
3.12 PLATFORM ENVIRONMENT EXAMPLES
For the MPC, two platform environment examples are shown in this chapter. These examples are
included to try to complement all the information regarding MPC and show a potential mapping of
abstract terms like FS and FA. The first one is about wayside and the second one is about on-board。
These examples do notinclude an exhaustive list, neither forthe functional systems nor for functional
applications, and are not trying to define MPC usage
Both platform environment examples are
proposed following the Figure 5 introduced in chapter 3.7.2 (ERJU SP CE domain: Glossary).
The principal concepts concerning the Glossary
are
Functional Systems (FS)
and
Functional
Application (FA). In the following figures, they are represented as green (FS) and in blue (FA).
Concerning the wayside environment and subsequently to Figure 10, RBC and Interlocking systems
are used as examples。

MODULAR PLATFORMS REQUIREMENTS
Based on the aspects of the Modular Platform Concept as described and discussed in the previous
chapter, the next step is to create a set of relevant requirements. These requirements are the basis
for architectural work in the next chapter.
Requirements towards railway-suitable (modular) computing platforms have been defined in the
past, as discussed in this Work package's first deliverable [18].
Requirements defined in the past
usually have a distinction between trackside and on-board systems, depending on their context. For
providing a
more
generic set of requirements, this Work package aims to remove this distinction
where feasible;
potentially
only containing
some optional
and specialized
requirements.
The
following briefly discusses the potential sources for this work。

5 MODULAR PLATFORMS ARCHITECTURE
The Modular Platform is a computing environment for the execution of mixed-critically workloads,
offering the central benefits of allowing portability , flexibility and re-use of business logic captured as
application software;
the So called "Functional Applications" (for this and other terms' definition;
please refer to the glossary in chapter 3.7.2). To enable these benefits, following the previous Work
and SP CE
domain inputs (see chapter 3.7, three distinct domains for the Modular Platforms
Concept architecture were derived:
Application-Level Platform Independence (ALPI)
Hardware-Level Platform Independence (HLPI)
Interfaces external to the Platform
Here, the notion of "platform independence" refers to the independence ofan actual implementation
respectively instantiation of the
Modular Platform concept (CPl, see chapter 3.11.
The relation
between the domains is shown in the following diagram。

5.1 MODULARIZATION ARCHITECTURE
The MPC is a truly modular environment when it's agnostic towards multiplicities and tasks of the
physical (e.9., hardware) and logical components (e.9., software executing a business logic). Taking
the approach from the previous chapter
the distinction of three MPC domains
and focusing on
the two providing independence methodologies (HLPIand ALPI), the modular setup of physical and
logical components can be introduced using simple examples。
First, in the context of HLPI (Hardware-level Platform Independence), the flexible deployment of
Functional Systems onto Physical Computing Elements being part of a Compartment Execution
Environment is shown.
Afterwards, the construction of CPs using the ALPI approach is discussed.
This is done using the terms and naming conventions established in chapter 3.7.2.
5.1.1
HLPI Modularization Architecture
Functional Systems are, on a high level, a collection of Compartments that together implement a
certain business logic. They can be seen as a deliverable by a supplier that an end-user wants to
deploy onto its CPI consisting of one or more Compartment Execution Environments (CEE).
HLPI provides the ability to execute a certain number of Compartments (CP) on a single Physical
Computing Element (PCE). Several PCEs can be partofa single CEE. Compartments are belonging
to a
Functional System (FS) and only are of value When
are
deployed as described in its
individual
FS Deployment
Rules (FSDR),
in
accordance
with
their approval
documents .
The
generalized view is shown in Figure 15 below.

For an exemplary FS that employs a

POG (Consolidating more software on less hardware.
implicates that CPs from different FS can be
executed on the same PCE While being free from interference according to MPC-AO4. Therefore
only three PCEs are needed to execute five CPs belonging to two FS.
How exactly the CPs are distributed over the available PCEs is not important for the MPC except for
conditions defined in the individual FSDRS.
With FSDR, FS-specific rules for deployment can be
demanded。
This would mostly be used to state that CPs belonging to redundancy configurations
have to be executed on distinct PCEs, but could also be used to make sure special applications like
2X2002 has groups of CPs executed in different locations (within a data centre, e.9. different fire
protection zones, or even outside ofa single data centre, e.9. for georedundancy).

Further examples can be constructed , especially as there is no limit to the number of CPs and FSDR
complexity in a single FS. Of course, also simple single-CP examples for Basic Integrity usage not
employing redundancy could be constructed . For the purpose of this description of HLPI modularity
for the MPC, the two examples already given should be sufficient。
5.1.2
ALPI Modularization Architecture
Where in the HLPI context, as shown in the chapter before; the deployment of CPs onto a CEE is
shown, the ALPI context is concerned with integrating Functional Applications (FA) into the CPs. It's
a Step that can be seen as a
supplier implementing a business logic and packaging it into CPs to be
bundled up to a full FS, together with the FSDR and approval documents。
The relevant difference is, however, that there is no mandate to employ ALPI
methods to build
suitable CPs, in order to allow the packaging of legacy or other software into CPs. For future projects;
using the ALPI approach can be beneficial , though, especially when needing access to the services
available in the MPC using 14, as introduced later in chapter 5.2.

When employing ALPI, within a CP the Runtime Environment (RTE) and the Safety Environment
(SE) together with their interfaces |4 and |5 are provided for the Functional Application (FA) to be
used. A potential use-case could be to use a
CP Without FA,
supplied by a platform vendor, and
install a FA into this CP. This kind of "empty"' CP _
where empty is referring to the missing FA
could
come prepared with all necessary services, the RTE and the SE, so that the FA developer can focus
on implementing the business logic. Also, updates to any component in such an "empty" CP would
be feasible in a generalized way, leading to installing the specific FA into updated (and potentially
pre-verified) CPs.
In the following figure, such an "empty" Compartment containing the ALPI components RTE and SE
is called ALPI-CP. This also implies that interfaces |4 and , where necessary, 15 are available within
this kind of CP to be used for FA development。

created in this process. The multiplicities for these different redundancy configurations are not shown
here. Also, the remaining FS artefacts FSDR and approval documents are not covered here,
35 are
implications that would result from a full configuration management。
5.2 SERVICE ARCHITECTURE
While the previous chapter was focusing on how individual Functional Systems are constructed in
the MPC, these FS have to rely on different services available to them and within the MPC. Many of
the advantages of the MPC are in fact dependent on a multitude of services that provide, together
with appropriate external interfaces, the Ways to build , deploy and maintain a full MPC system。
As envisioned by the SP CE domain, service and management functionalities as remote update;
diagnosis, IT-security are defined and provided separately:
3)
by ERJU as one generic rail standard for all aspects relevant for the rail systems
b)
by standard |T solutions for the aspects in context of VE, depending on the selected solution
of the VE。
This separation has an impact to the service architecture and on the external interfaces of the
platform. When the Compartment Execution Environment (CEE) itself cannot be expected to provide
a standardized interface
due to allowing multiple options for standard |T solutions, only limited by
the fact that these solutions need to fulfil the requirements towards them

to be defined to bridge these differences. These architectural components are introduced on a high
level in this chapter and are further detailed and explained, as wellas their interfaces, in chapter 8 _

Compartment Execution & Management Environment (CELE
When (exchangeable) standard | solutions are used for the VE (Virtualization Environment) inside
CEE (Compartment Execution Environment) , the assumption is that there is a technical management
tool respectively interface for the management of the whole CEME, including the PCEs,
VEs and
VCEs, offered by the chosen COTS VE solution. Iaddition_ohhe_SPCE gefinitionOf CEE, the
CEME also provides interfaces towards the
Platform Management;

The interface, referred to in the
figure as
Orchestration & Diagnostics" , is expected to be part of the solution used and to be required
to expose the necessary functionality for CEE management. Implementation details of interfaces |2
and |3 are specific to the chosen, suitable VE solution, and are not shown here.
Shared Services
The shared services as mentioned here are the combination of several services defined by multiple
ERJU SP domains and contain security, update and diagnostics related functionality. Specification
ofthem is out of scope in WP26, but highly relevant for the MPC.
Pltform Management
The Platform Management (PM) is a new component added to the input of the ERJU SP CE domain
and deemed necessary within the scope of the MPC. The PM controls the specific CEE, interacts

from the
Functional Systems While also managing their configuration and updates. Its function within the MPC
is to enable the usage of different suitable COTS CEEs while providing fixed interfaces (11) to the
outside. This way, CPIs with different PCE+VE+VCE combinations still expose the same interfaces
to the outside
The PMis also providing a User Interface (UI), especially to support the user stories
for the MPC as outlined in chapter 3.9. For example;, central tasks of the PM are to properly deploy
FS according to their FSDR, monitoring the FS's operational state and reacting to any non-regular
situation that can oCCUr。
There is no guidance from the MPC on the amount of FS managed by a
single PM, respectively the number of PCE available in a CPl.
The implementation of the PM is
expected to fulfil to Basic Integrity requirements only。

Similarly, an update client can be implemented. A dedicated CP-MGMT would be dependent on the

The
update and diagnostics services are only two of the possible services. Security services for
APM, PKIand time synchronization are not shown here but would be integrated into the FS CPs。
Combination Of CP-MGMTand FSCP
For certain implementations of MPC, i might be feasible to integrate the functionality needed within
the CP-MGMT into the normal FS CPs. This can reduce the number of CPs in a given environment,
as one CP-MGMT per PCE is necessary. However, it creates a strong dependency on a given VE
also in the normal FS CPs. Additionally, only one CP per PCE should read and report data from the
VCE,
VE

PCE;
to
avoid

and
double reporting issues during
operation. This creates dependencies between different FS that might not be aware of each other,
leading to further complications.

The Modular Platforms Architecture builds on
of the ERJU SP CE domain input and prior work
of work package 26 itself。
The previous introduction of ALPI and
HLPI layers helps to simplify
Systems Views and the discussion, and also represents concrete areas of expertise and future
product development。
The modularization and service architecture approaches shown in this chapter build the basis for the
following chapters, detailing how HLPI,ALPI and interfaces can be specified。
From the architecture perspective, one open point remains: A combined modularization architecture
proposal showing how the deeper levels of FS (e.9., compartments, RTE,
Functional Applications;
etc. ) interact with the interfaces introduced in the service architecture, as well as with the Platform
Management and Shared Services (see Open-011).

common virtualization environment, the architecture
benefits from a reliable and Well-established solution。
It includes all the necessary management
functionalities for efficient software orchestration. Furthermore,
the streamlined management of
various commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware versions and types from different suppliers Will
be significantly simplified. This approach is further enhanced by the availability of qualified hardware
from multiple hardware suppliers。
To accomplish this, it is essential to define the specific interfaces between hardware, virtualization
layer, and Functional System software in alignment with the safety and security architectures。
It is
important to note that the virtualization software and hardware are considered to be non-safety
components without safety implications,
they must still meet all relevant security requirements。
The subsequent sub-chapters provide
an
oVerview
of various aspects related to
the layered
architecture, including requirements for architecture elements and any outstanding issues that need
to be addressed. The primary focus is to identify requirements from the perspectives of safety (see
chapter 6.6 ), security (see chapter 6.8) and availability (see chapter 6.9)

The communication interfaces between
FSs shall be standardized. By this it may not make
a
difference x connected other FSs are running on the same computing elements or not. Even FSs
running on specific hardware (e.9. legacy systems which are already installed) can be connected via
the same standardized communication interfaces。
IIO control functionality is out of scope of HLPI. Such IIO control functionalities need

USe cases, e.9. point controllers need other specialized

By
this
a

standardization of the system internal architecture of I/O controllers is not easily possible。
Functional Systems that require |/O control functionality are connected via the communication-based
interface |0 to Use-case
specific I/O controllers。
6.2.2
FS internal communication
Each solution of an SE supports communication-based interfaces between the FS compartments
Without any constraints regarding the usage of the network, as e.9. no kind of constraints as "direct
LAN cables between the VCE" .
6.2.3
FStime behavior
Time critical processes in
HW related functionalities are realized behind I0
Within dedicated IIO
controllers。
Note
that latency times of communication technology
leads
to additional delay
in
message
processing.
This must be foreseen in the overall architecture and safety case
The trackside overall architecture (interlocking, radio block centre;
object controllers) is already
defined in such a way thatan
interlocking needs to show reaction times in a range of 1-2 seconds。
The new overall architecture within the on-board system must be defined in such a way that the FS
can react in time ranges below
second, with potential real time constraints depending on the
functions.
Time critical processes in HW related functionalities With faster timing requirements are
realized behind |0 within the use-case specific I/O controllers。
6.2.4
VE as non-safe software without safety relevance
The proposed safety architecture is based on a non-safety related virtualization environment. By this
the functionality of the virtualization environment such as e.9., task scheduling shall not affect safety;
but it may affect availability.
Example:
If the
scheduling of SW parts of aggregated FSs is not processed as required by the individual FS,
then the FS itself shall identify this problem and react in the needed way from view of safety。
In case of a safety related FS the safety concept of the SE must not require a specific behaviour of
the virtualization environment from view of safety. A misbehaviour of the virtualization environment
Shall never affect safety, only availability. See REQ-HLPI-1.
For example; there is
a time constraint of
second from balise reader to brake in the ETCS on-board context
This
constraint needs to be budgeted over all systems in the reaction chain_

Standardization Update Process for FS Compartments
It's assumed that the process for the handling of FS Compartments in context of updating a FS is
defined by the System Pillar Transversal Group and hence out of scope for WP2G.
6.3 RESOURCE PARTITIONING FOR FS COMPARTMENTS
From view of availability (i.e., stable running FS compartments
it's essential to assign physical CPU
resources (e.g., cores, cache
shared bus) exclusively to individual FS compartments. Assigning
virtual cores to individual SW components within the FS compartments (e.9. Functional Application
Replica using one CPU core exclusively) can only happen within the Compartment。
The VE shall provide the mapping of CPU cores exclusively to VCE, see REQ-HLPI2。
The
CPU performance provided by the mapped
CPU resources
must be guaranteed for every
timepoint during the runtime of an FS Compartment, see REQ-HLPI-3.
Parallel installation of additional FS Compartments (of other FS) in additional VCEs on the same
Virtualization Environment Instance must not have any impact on the guaranteed CPU performance
(cores) for running FS Compartments, see REQ-HLPI 4。

Modularity and independency of VE Config for FS Compartments
The individual VE configurations of FS compartments shall be modular and independent. Each FS
Compartment shall have its own configuration for the VCE. Adding or deleting of FS compartments
onto the VE instance must not have any impact on the VCE config of the other FS compartments.
See REQHLPI5.
6.4.2

The virtualization environment shall provide defined and stable interfaces for the configuration of the
VCE usage by FS compartments。
A
new version of the VE may not have any impact onto the VCE

Each change in the user interface for the VCE configuration shall be compatible in such a way that
existing VCE configs (of already running system) can be used furthermore. See REQ-HLPI-6。

Summary
6.5.5.1
Trackside Use case
For the trackside use case ofa data centre the isolation and independency of the aggregated FS
is highly essential for the individual handling of FS compartments during the lifecycle of the data
Centre.
If some FSas
interlockings or RBCs are already running With full safety responsibility then it must
be possible to bring additional FS into the data centre without touching the running FS, even without
the need of extra integration tests of the already running FS on the VE。
By this the trackside use case needs best possible isolation of the aggregated FS。
Best possible
resource partitioning is needed
to achieve independency
and  availability
of the
FS technical
interference between the aggregated FS in context of resource usage.
Such an isolation is achieved in best possible way by the usage ofa hypervisor with virtual machines
for the FS compartments. From safety view some functionalities must be provided by native running
Software NHA (see chapter 6.6). This means that a hypervisor is the preferred solution.

6.5.5.2
On-board USe case
In the on-board use case Software changes or enhancements will not be done during the operation
Of trains.
A
train Will always be stopped for SW maintenance purposes。
By this the independent
handling of the individual FS in context of software maintenance is not as essential as for trackside.
Additionally, the physical computing elements within the train will not provide the same amount of
CPU resources as in a track side data centre, meaning the computing element resources are limited
and must be used very efficiently。
For such an on-board use case a container-based architecture will be possible to run basic integrity
software, Which does not depend on a concrete SE. Such container based aggregated BIL FS must
be integrated holistically to ensure the availability of the overall system。
Both, hypervisors or containerised approaches are in principle appropriate
as Well for on-board
safety critical Functional Systems. Depending on concrete needs and existing constraints a trade-
Off between flexibility, extendibility and available resources may drive a concrete solution decision.
Nevertheless, for a multi-vendor setup a hypervisor solution should be much more appropriate.

6.6 INTERFACE |2 AND HW ARCHITECTURE
The interface |2 of the hardware is notan interface in the sense ofa programming interface but rather
the definition of required CPU characteristics like processor instruction set, needed CPU features
like performance;
etc. from the perspective of the Functional System running aggregated on the
virtualization layer above。
In this context the topic of "flexible and HW-independent usage of HW"
must be analysed regarding
the technical details of the HW which need to be defined as
generic standard".
The goal of such
a standardized architecture is to achieve full flexibility in replacing the used
hardware by another hardware without changing the software of the Functional Systems running
above.
Assumptions:
CPU architecture is specified by |2/13 and has to match the FSDR of deployed FS。
No usage of CPU emulation below |3 to avoid potential issues with systematic errors in the
emulation layer。
For future proof solutions its essential that the safety concept of each SE solution is basically
independent from the processor instruction set to be able to change the CPU architecture without
impact to the safety concept, see REQ-HLPI-7。

'interface'

further study。

6.7 SAFETY
6.7.1
HW related information for SE
Forthe aggregation of several FS compartments of different safety integrity levels, possibly provided
by different suppliers, on the same virtualization environment the safety architecture is essential。
Figure 29 shows the proposed safety-architecture for flexible and efficient handling of aggregated
FS (on the same computing element) possibly provided by different suppliers. For efficient handling
of safety related FS compartments running decoupled in parallel on same VE it's essential that the
VE software below the FS compartments does not have safety relevance.
Safety relevance of the
common VE layer would lead to high effort in overall integration of the FS compartments (provided
by different vendors) with the VE due to "safety related resource sharing of the VE" .
So it's proposed
that this VE software is non-safe (possibly provided by a third party).
Each solution of safety environment shall define its own safety concept in a way Which allows the
usage ofnon-safe VE, each misbehaviour of the VE has to be identified by the SE and the SE must
react safe, see REQHLPI1.
VE will serve information to the safety environment above, but safety responsibility is completely on
Side of the SE。
The figure below shows for the basic safety architecture the SW layers running on one individual
physical computing element This architecture is independent from the details of the safety principle
as e.9.2003 or 2*2002, meaning it's the same architecture for the other compartments of the up to
SIL4 FS running on other physical computing elements (but not shown in the figure).

As described later in this chapter; some safety related functionalities within an SE need a reliable
access to the physical computing elements。
The information cannot be created by FS compartment itself running within
3
virtual machine
because reliable access to underlying physical hardware is notguaranteed for SW runningin a virtual
machine.
This information cannot be provided by a 3rd party VE because it would not be able to argue the
quality of this information (by 3rd party VE) on side of the SE。
As a result, it's necessary to provide this hardware related information by a native running reliable
Software (reliable in the way that the provided information is not influenced systematically)。
This
native running software is called "Native Hardware Access (NHA)" =
and this software needs direct
hardware access Without influence by virtualization or emulation.
Reference to 50129 is related to
ensuring the nominal operating conditions for the hardware and the system. The correct operation
can be ensured by directly monitoring the parameters (defined by NHA) or indirectly by monitoring
the behaviour of the system. The requirements and example Use cases for this are described within
the next chapters。
6.7.1.1
Distribution of up to SIL4 FS Comp on different CPUs
The Safety Environment needs a reliable information about the identification of the physical CPU
hardware on Which the compartment is running.
This information can be provided in the required
reliable way by a dedicated software component NHA (Native Hardware Access).

6.7.1.3 Independent clock source for the creation of a safe monotonic time
The SE needs to realize time related safety critical services as e.9. cyclic and synchronous replica
processing or timer-services for the FA。
To achieve a
Safe monotonic time'
the SE needs 2 independent monotonic clock input sources for
safety, an additional 3rd (in case of 2003) or even 41 (in case of 2*2002) independent input source
for availability。
Each of the clock input sources must be provided from a different physical HW and
all these input sources may not be influenced in systematic way.
This information can be provided in the required reliable way by a dedicated software component
NHA (Native Hardware Access), which is running natively on the hardware, see REQ-HLPI-10.

6.7.1.6 Summary
The detailed solution for such a native running software NHA depends on
a)
the concrete solution of the VE as e.9. host OS and developer interface of the VE
b)
the required hardware information depending on the safety concept of a SE solution
C)
the provided data of the concrete hardware via the interface |2.
Since NHA functionality depends
the concrete needs of the SEs, it is challenging to standardise
i. Further study is necessary to enable support for diverse SE solutions While not creating limitations
on COTS hardware selection.

Different SE solutions with different safety concepts provide different SRACs in context of the
required HW related data. For a generic usage of the same COTS hardware for all SE solutions the
COTS hardware has to provide all required data via interface 12 to NHA。
The grade of HW independence of such
3
NHA functionality depends on the SE solution specific
details of the required information at the interface 12, meaning the HW related SRACS of the SE
solution
Ite contextof HWrelated SRACSSWe havetogifferentiate between:
1)
basic hardware information:
CPU HW identification (e.9. by MAC address, TPM content)
steady system clock
2)  specific hardware information which depends on concrete HW details like specific sensors or
Cores,e.9.
core pinning
CPU andlor other temperatures
voltages
For basic hardware data 1) the access by NHA will be possible without dependency to the concrete
interface of the hardware. NHA gets the basic hardware data via OS functionalities of the Host OS
of the VE. For this basic hardware data a change of the hardware should not have an impact onto
NHA, SRAC fulfilment by NHA should be possible in a generic way.
For specific hardware data 2) the access by NHA must probably be adapted specifically for different
HW variants. In case access to physical hardware details as sensors is not the same for different
hardware variants, this would mean: a change of the hardware may have an impact onto NHA and
the SRAC fulfilment by NHA has to be re-validated for the new hardware variant and new version of
NHA. Anyhow, standardised access to sensors should be strived for where feasible to avoid such
re-validation efforts。
Openpoint:
It must be clarified, if the required information from the physical hardware can
be provided via standardized interface |2 or if the NHA functionality must be
adapted for different HW variants. See Open-008.
Openpoint:
the responsibility and technical handling (installation and update) of such a
NHA software must be clarified . See Open-009.
6.7.2
Safe handling of Software
Handling of safety related software by basic integrity management software running on non-safe
operating systems and VE leads to the hazard that handling of the software (starting and stopping,
storing and deleting) is not reliable from view of safety。
Example:
It cannot be guaranteed in context of SW update of safety related SW that all old SW components
are
stopped and deleted and newly installed SW components are started. Inconsistencies due to
mixture of old and new versions of the safety related SW components must be identified by the SE。

FS compartments are not directly affected by IT security, but integration of interface to IT security
functionalities is necessary。
Here, workload for IT-security is not isolated by resource partitioning, cross-interference between FS
compartments is possible (workload of one FS compartments affects performance of another FS

Conclusion
From view of "best possible resource isolation 
the ERJU defined I security functionalities should
be implemented
for
each
FS compartment individually。
From
View
of "responsibility for SL3
certification" each FS should be by itself responsible for IT security of own FS. This means that I
security has to he provided as part of the FS compartment.
Preferred solution is architecture with |T security provided by the FS compartments as described in
chapter 6.8.1.
6.9 AVAILABILITY OF FUNCTIONAL SYSTEMS
6.9.1
FS Runtime behavior, reaction time and intercommunication
The
basis for high availability of a
safety related FS is
3
nearly perfect deterministic runtime
behaviour, reaction time of the involved
FS compartments
with high-speed communication
i-
between.
The SE replicas of an up to SIL4 FS, which are running in different FS compartments on different
(physical) computing elements, process a time-critical inter-synchronization between the SE replicas
as e.9. for processing of a safe voting mechanism。
Ifan individual process step is not perfect (runtime behaviour, reaction time, inter-communication)
the SE identifies this and reacts in a safe way as e.9. by stopping the affected SW parts. This leads
to reduced FS availability and could potentially resultin the stoppage ofall application replicas ofthe
FS。
The VE shall guarantee a stable runtime behaviour and reaction time ofall SW parts Within a safety
critical FS Compartment for each timepoint; see REQ-HLPI-14。
6.9.2
Individual failures in hardware or software of the platform
Failures in the hardware or software of the VE lead to failures within the FS compartment(s).
To
address these failures effectively, redundancy mechanisms for the FS compartments are necessary。
In case of an up to SIL4 FS this redundancy is realized within the SE and depends on the safety
principle (as e.9.2003 or 2*2002).
In
case of BIL
FS,
the backup functionalities of VE standard

redundancy mechanism. It depends on detail of the concrete FS x such standard solutions can be
Used ornot:
Requirement addressed to the SE ofan up to SIL4 FS: The SE shall support the automated repair
ofa failed FS compartment, see REQ-HLPL 15。
6.9.3
Individual failures in communication
Foravailability of external communication to connected systems, each FS uses at least 2 redundant
communication
channels。
Basically,
each
individual
FS compartment
can   provide
individual
communication channels of a redundant communication.
For flexible usage on the side of the FS
compartment for automated repair of broken
network communication channels its necessary to
consider all FS compartments in the configuration and physical installation of the network。

The VE shall support the mapping of FS compartments to virtualized Ethernet adapters and to tie a
virtualized Ethernet adapter to a specific physical ethernet card. See REQ-HLPI-16。
6.9.4
Availability in context of SW maintenance
SW maintenance of non-safe software as e.9. for |T security patching shall be possible during the
operational phase of the FS for trackside use cases。
Example:
Foran up to SIL4 FS with 2003 principle, the process for an IT security
shall look like this:
Update of the FS compartment
with new version for IT-security mechanism . For this the FS
keeps running as 2002 (FS compartment 2 and 3) during the update phase and achieves
2003 mode again after Synchronization of the updated FS compartment
with the other FS
compartments 2 and 3.
Repeat this for FS compartment 2.
Repeat this for FS compartment 3
Requirementaddressed to the FS: update ofthe IT security components within the FS compartments
shall be possible "VCE-wise one after the other"
see REQHLPI 18.
Update of the VE shall be possible in same Way
PCE-wise one after the other
see REQHLPL 19.
Requirement addressed to the Platform Management: The dependency to update "one after the
other must be considered, see REQHLPI20.
Openpoint:
The
architecture
for
updating
FS
by
Shared
Services
and
Platform
Management has to be clarified. See Open-014.
6.9.5
Geographical redundancy
For trackside use cases of the Modular Platform, the aspect of "high grade of centralization'
leads
to increased availability requirements, such as geographical redundancy.
Geographical redundancy means that the FSis running distributed in different geographical locations
to provide best possible availability in case of a disaster scenario (as e.9. blackout, terror attack,
)
The main
challenge in context of geographical redundancy is the handling of the split-brain problem
foran up to SIL4 FS. See CAP theorem
Wkipedja:
When a network partition failure happens, it must be decided whether to do one of the following:
cancel the operation and thus decrease the availability but ensure consistency
proceed with the operation and thus provide availability but risk inconsistency。
Note this
doesn'tnecessarily mean that system is highly available to its users。
For up to SIL4 FS the consistency must be ensured, and this means that a network partition failure
must be handled in
a
safe way. Additionally, the safe communication to connected systems as
decentralized object controllers
must be
considered.
Safety protocols
as RaSTA require fully
Synchronized communication channels; which means the switch-over of a centralized interlocking

logic from one location to another geographical location is not possible without interruption of the
safe communication to object controllers。
The safety related handling of split-brain topic must be solved on the functional level of the SEin the
FS, even as e.9. for safety principle 2x2002 without geographical distribution. The VE does not know
details about redundancy mechanism and handling of geographical redundancy by the up to SIL4
FS

the safety related architecture for georedundant FS with safe handling of split-

Diagnosis of the FS
Each FS is responsible to provide diagnosis data about its own health state (e.9., about the health
state ofrunning SE replicas, FA replicas,

11 Diagnosis (as defined by TCCS) to the Shared Services as central data sink, see REQ-HLPI 23。
Additionally, the diagnosis data must be provided to the Platform Management as data sink for the
handling of FS compartments, see REQ-HLPI-24.
FS Which is running in several parallel FS compartments provides diagnosis data by each FS
compartment individually.
This is based on redundancy principle for availability and additionally by
individual diagnosis states in the individual FS compartments. It may happen that individual failures
happen within individual compartments, as e.9. one FS compartment may have an individual SW
failure inside_
The Platform Management must handle this relationship of the individual FS compartments of the
FS, meaning that one FS provides diagnosis data of several FS compartments, see REQ-ALPI-025.

guarantee that newly ordered hardware is 100% identical to previous deliveries of the same type.
The detailed HW related dependencies between the COTS hardware and the VE at the interface |2
must be identified and "managed'
in context of maintenance, for this see chapter 6.6.
6.14 PUBLIC CLOUD
With "public cloud" we
mean computing services offered by third-party providers over the public
Internet, making them available to anyone Who wants to purchase them. Computing services are
sold on-demand , allowing customers to pay only per usage for the CPU cycles, storage, or bandwidth

Consume
The cloud provider is responsible for the management and maintenance of the
services. Access is done via the public internet。
Examples:
Amazon Web Services (AWS)
Google Compute Engine (GCE)
IBM Cloud
Microsoft Azure
We do not see "public cloud" as a realistic use-case for the moment and within the next 5 years for
safety-related applications。
1
Data Center ("Private Cloud") with defined overall responsibility will be
possible. Basic challenges for "public cloud" are described in the following chapters。
6.14.1
Safety architecture
Basically, FS compartments of rails systems could technically run in a public cloud. Even safety
critical FS Compartments could run in a public cloud under the condition that the needed information
about the physical hardware can be provided in needed reliable way, see chapter 6.8。
For the FS compartments itself it should not make a difference i the Virtual machine is in a private
cloud or public cloud. Even protocol drivers for safety relevant communication protocols as RaSTA
can runin a
public cloud due to the safety architecture "underlying VE is not safety relevant".
The topic of "native hardware access" (NHA) is not solved for public cloud.
6.14.2
Security architecture
Handling of public cloud as a secure device in context of rail infrastructure is not solved.
Public cloud providers typically do not allow to install own /T security solutions。
6.14.3
Performance, reaction time and availability
The fulfilment of requirements of especially safety-relevant FS compartments to the underlying
software from view of performance, reaction time and reliability in the runtime behaviour for each
timepoint over long periods of several years is not yet experienced in the context of public clouds.
Such requirements (performance, reaction time) do not affect the safety but the availability of the
FS。
Example:
I
a
SW component does
not Wake
up and react in
the required time-range of 20-SOms this
misbehaviour would be identified by the SE and would lead to safe reactions and perhaps to a stop
of the safety critical FS compartment(s)
6.14.4
Integration and maintenance
Public cloud providers are not able to integrate rail systems with an updated version of the public
cloud. Handling of changes in the public cloud in context of integration with the rail systems is not
solved.

6.14.5
Business Case
Comparison of costs for running rail systems over decades within a public cloud with costs for private
cloud has not been done。
6.14.6
Responsibility
How to handle the situation that changes or instabilities of the public cloud lead to reactions on side
of the rail systems and in consequence to impact onto the rail operation (e.9. as stopping of trains
due to safe reaction of failed FS compartments)?
6.15 CERTIFICATION
In context of certification the main goal is to define the safety- and security-architecture of the
different layers within the computing platform in such a way that changes in non-safe parts like the
COTS based hardware orin common SW layers like the virtualization can be handled without impact
onto safety- and security-certification of the Functional Systems running above.
This is in the scope
ofthe SP PRAMS domain that is currently working on a document
Evolution Management of safety
related systems" [17]. Further findings and recommendations from
on modular certification and
homologation can as well be expected in the upcoming R2DATO Deliverable 026.4 [20].
6.16 CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK
The situation "various Functional Systems running aggregated on same computing element" has a
lot of new challenges affecting the architecture;
interfaces and processes Which have not been
addressed so far by standardisation as,e.9., EULYNX, Which is up to now focused only on the
trackside object controller。
The basic results Of our investigations show that essential architecture aspects depend
on the
specific solutions for SE and VE:
1)
The grade of HW independence is SE solution specific and depends on the safety concept of
the SE. Different HW related SRACs of different SE solutions require different NHA variants with
even specific direct dependencies to the interface |2 to the physical hardware and interface |3
extension to the SE running above 13.
A
generic HW independent solution of NHA is not possible for different SE solutions due to SE
solution specific dependencies at the interfaces |2 and 13 extension。
2)
The rules for handling of FS compartments in context of installation and update on side of the
Platform Management depend on the specific SE solution (as e.9.2003,2*2002,  .)
3)
The detailed solution for the SW orchestration on side of the Platform Management depends on
the specific VE solution。
4)
The technical SW architecture for realization of NHA depends on the specific VE solution and
belonging Host OS.
5)
The details for clarification of the overall architecture for IT-security according to IEC 62443
depend on the specific VE solution。
The technical quality of guaranteed resource isolation and performance depends on the
specific VE solution and must be proven individually for each specific SE solution。

Summar
The depicted architecture and principles of interfaces |2 and |3 are generally independent of the
specific virtualization environment and specific hardware and safety layer implementations (as long
as certain requirements are metas detailed in Section HLPI Requirements ) . However, specific safety
layer realizations may impose specific requirements on the NHA. Hence there will possibly not be
one single NHA realization.
Further studies are needed to explore how the NHA requirements for
different safety solutions can be harmonized or potentially omitted altogether。
If several different SE solutions shall run on the same VE solution, it's necessary to handle the SE
solution specific aspects in contextof
HW related SRACS to fulfill by specific NHA functionality" and
HW dependency individually for each SE solution.

APPLICATIONLEVEL PLATFORM INDEPENDENCE (ALPI)
7.1 INTRODUCTION
The main objective of the ALPI Interface, used in the MPC modular platform, is to simplify the design
Ofa
generic "functional application" that realizes a Business Logic in the railway sector.
The purpose of the interface is to allow application engineers to focus on solving problems closely
related to Railway Functional Applications, delegating part of the solutions to problems concerning
safety, security, HWISW integration, deployment, and maintenance to the underlying layers of the
MPC architecture.
The interface also aims to allow the Use of standard COTS solutions as much as
possible, to facilitate development of Business Logic by different suppliers.
The proposed ALPI interface shall minimize the impact on the development of runtime services,
providing the characterization of the services through configuration values (see REQ-ALPI-016), that
define
the
characteristics
of safety;
security,
and
management functionalities
for
functional
application SW orchestration。
This simplifies the interface on the functional application
USer Side,
hiding the complexity of the solutions adopted in the MPC architecture to ensure the required levels
of safety and security (see REQ-ALPI-04).
The ALPIinterface makes it possible to use different MPC platforms from different vendors, enabling
extensive Use of standard IT solutions.

the
market, especially
in
relation
to developments
in
the
felds
of Operational
Technologies (OT), Information
and
Communication Technologies (ICT), Safety
and  Security
Management。
This chapter deals with basic assumptions, preconditions, and cornerstones necessary to build and
specify an APIused by applications with safety relevance from CENELEC Basic Integrity up to SIL4.
It reflects possibilities and ideas but does not intend to head towards a specific direction, as this shall
be left to the vendors of the API . However, the suggest approach is to promote the adoption of a
common high level API set, providing the same functionalities, eventually with different semantics
harmonized with the introduction of adapters。
The discussions presented
in
this chapter are
based
On
the inputs from the
SP
CE domain
(chapter 3.7), the architecture proposal in WP26's first deliverable [18] and the ongoing work in
WP26 itself。
The following description includes aspects related to the "programming interfaces'
and related to the
definitions ofneeded functionalities from the View ofa Functional Application. The descriptions cover
both runtime services and off-line configuration。
With reference to safety, the descriptions refer to the |4 interface in the case of Functional Application
with Basic Integrity Level, while they refer to the |5 interface in the case of safety-related functions.
It is assumed that all |4 services are provided by the RTE, So |4 coincides With RTE. The Safety
Related |5 interface contains the restricted subset of |4 services compliant to CENELEC rules and
additional safety services provided by the Safety Layer, needed to tranparently manage safety
requirements。
The ALPI 15 interface cointains the transparent safety management of the replicas When needed。
The off-line configuration allows the proper selection of the safety services. The configuration knows
the nature of the FA: ifit requires safety services ornot, ORifit
requires 15 or not.

7.2 CORNERSTONES OF ALPI
To achieve platform independence on application level, the API serving the application must provide
all necessary safety-related
and
non-safety-related
interfaces
and
resOUrCeS
for fulfilling
he
application functions including diagnosis, logging, and monitoring.
Another basic aspect for platform independence is, that certain architectural principles are shared.
Otherwise, standardisation Would be hard,
not to say impossible。
As
3
result of this, also the
behaviour on the other platform interfaces must be specified With respect to the goal since this is a
necessary pre-requisite for full interoperability.
Furthermore,
Platform independence requires a standardised language to specify the application's
deployment-configuration in a platform agnostic way. During integration of the application with a
specific
platform,
the
platform-agnostic
application
deployment-configuration
is
then
translatedlconverted into a corresponding platform specific application deployment-configuration.
The process related to the deploymentand configuration should be managed using a "model driven"
approach。
The model must provide the rules and procedures for the aggregation of the elementary
basic elements necessary for the incremental construction of the subsystem layers. For each level,
the minimum constituent elements, i.e.
the
basic components" are identified and their use and
integration is described via data structures。
Note that, this translation or conversion is not an easy,
automatic task as it needs to deal with technical functionality as well as with safety principles and
fulfilment. Common standard tools must be used during the process to configure components and
their aggregation.
7.2.1
Main principles followed for the ALPIs definition
The three guidelines that are adopted in this document are listed here:
The implementation of Business Logic should be as easy as possible。
The implementation of Business Logic should be as standard as possible (see REQ-ALPI-
02)
The Business Logic should be easily integrated and reused。
7.2.1.1
Functional Interface goals
These
are achieved through a functional interface that ensures:
a
Independence: ALPI shall allow developing an application regardless of the SWIHW of
the underlying layers (see REQ-ALPI-01)
b
Transparency:
Transparency
of
the
complexities
related
to
safety
and
security
architectureslmechanisms (see REQ-ALPI-06)
C
Compatibility and Portability: ALPI shall allow running the same application on different
commercial of-the-shelf platforms, using standard HWISW basic components (see REQ-
ALPI-05)

Flexibility: maximum flexibility shall be allowed in case of Non-Safety Related Functional
Application
to
take
full advantage
Of

environment should be avoided; however, solutionslproducts that favour a high level of

This paragraph summarizes basic and agreed assumptions. As a goal,
a
general direction of the
result should be imaginable after reading this section. For each assumption an impact evaluation on
ALPIand on Functional Application is carried out in advance。
7.3.1.1
Architectural Assumptions
Following an API usually also means to adhere to a certain architecture Or
at least, to some basic
architectural concepts。
This paragraph tries to summaries exactly those concepts in a high-level
description。
The main goal of ALPI is the standardization of the development of a Business Logic. It is assumed
that a Business Logic consists in the implementation of one or more Functional Applications based
on services provided by ALPI.

The platform can be assessed against relevant standards (as at least CENELEC EN50126
EN50716
EN50129
and additional
ones

EN50155
for on-board)
These  standards
influence architectural decisions for the modular platform concept。
Functional Application and
ALPI must be compliant to relevant CENELEC standards. (see REQ-ALPI-024)

Redundancy for safety is supported, depending on and controlled via configuration. ALPI 15
provides services that allow a Safety Related Functional Application to transparently manage
redundancy for safety.
4
Redundancy for availability is supported, depending on and controlled via configuration. ALPI
14 provides services that allow a Functional Application to manage redundancy for availability

Communication is message-based. ALPI provides services that enable communication in a
Single, standardized, common Way。

7.3.1.2
Platform Components
Platform components are the basic components, tools and libraries needed to implement, test and
rUn
applications, such as:
Toolchain (e.9. validated compiler, linker, diagnosis, tracing) (see REQ-ALPI-029)
System Libraries (e.9. glibc; crypto-libs)
Coverage- and Test-Tools

Suropes Rail
These components are provided by the Run Time Environment and may be specific, depending on
the RTE.ALPI provides a standard "model driven" description that allows the integration of the
Functional Application with the needed ingredients in a common standard Way。
7.3.1.3
Platform Services
The platform services discussed here are to be seen as partof the services provided to an application
by the "Independence API" . These include but are not limited to:
Logging (e.9. syslog) (see REQ-ALPI-019, REQ-ALPI-036)
Process control (e.9. create; clone, delete)
Memory management (e.9. malloc, free)
Timing (e.9. time of day, sleep, different clocks ) (see REQ-ALPI-030)
Communication (e.9. sockets, message queues)
Maintenance-related diagnostics and errorcodes (see REQ-ALPI-038)
Security functions (see REQ-ALPI-014)
Persitency functions
Note that
of these services could be safety relevant。
For the correct usage of these services
bothin the BlL and SIL cases, ALPI will allow to specify the Safety Integrity Level to be used through
the configuration, keeping the runtime interfaces as unchanged as possible,
Due to the trade-off between the maximum flexibility for non-Safety Related Functional Application
and the constraints imposed by the CENELEC standard, ALPI will provide the Safety Related
Functional Application with a restricted subset of the available RTE services。
7.3.1.4
Functionality Implementation Assumptions
In this section, assumptions are proposed on the functionalities that ALPI must provide for the
developmentand implementation ofan application. These functionalities mustalso take into account
any constraints deriving from the use of the modular platform.
The assumptions considered concern architecture, life cycle, communications, diagnosis。
ALPI makes assumptions regarding how Applications Will work and to how
are structured and
may favor certain implementation concepts that doesn't relate to MPC.
For example;
the usage of
3
gateway concept for the implementation
of safe protocols and
Specialized data services for diagnostics are handled here。
Note
that
these
kinds
of assumptions
and
rUles
need
to
be

defined

documentation.
It is assumed that ALPI will provide a Functional Application with the services based on the following
functionalities provided by the modular platform:
Configuration for runtime behavior with reference to execution environment; Redundancy
Safety Integrity Level, Security Integrity Level, Communication.
Lifecycle: StartlOperatelStop phases. (see REQ-ALPI-031)

The behaviour of the modular platform needs to be well defined within the user documentation. Even
i the
implementation details do not need to be known , basic behaviour and maybe also limitations

As a general concept, the platform shall allow to run applications with different levels of criticality in
parallel. This so-called "mixed criticality" approach decouples the lifecycle of applications of different
SIL levels from each other and shall ease the process of changing, especially for basic integrity
applications (see REQ-ALPI-013)
Of course, this goal can only be reached 讦 the safety solution

Note: changing of functionality and using same functions on a different RTE without doing anything
regarding safety assessment is currently not possible and needs further study.

Configuration data is consisting of at least two fundamental parts:

again partitioned into

into marketlcustomer specific data and product generic data
RTE configuration data for software execution (see REQ-ALPI-033).
For all RTE specific configuration a strong requirement would be; that all platforms from different

common RTE syntax and semantic;
SO that
running the same application on
different platforms is as easy as possible。

Application utilizes the underlying platform。
It contains syntax and semantic details for each and
every purpose needed from the application.
As outlined in the chapters above, more than only this ALPI is needed to realize the goal of portable
applications, such as architectural preconditions and concrete platform behaviour. All that kind of
necessities, including ALPI,
need to be described in detail within the user documentation.

7.4 ALPI DETAILS
Based
On
What is reported in
the chapter
7.3,
this
section provides further details about the
architecture, layers, and models used to describe the ALPI interface. Descriptions are based on the
inputs from the SP CE domain (chapter 3.7), the architecture proposal in WP2G's deliverable [18],
[19] and the ongoing work in WP2G itself。
7.4.1
Assumptions
Application developers should be able to focus on implementing the application logic. AIl safety and
fault tolerance mechanisms not inherent to the
application's logic
specifically redundancy, voting
and persistence
shall be implemented in, and transparently handled by the platform。
The application-level platform independence (ALPI) interface provides the standardised abstraction
ofall platform's specific hardware and software
allowing for portable applications.
ALPI should also allow the aggregation and the interaction of Functional Application with different
Safety Integrity Level into a single Functional System
7.4.2
ALPIarchitecture and layers
From a functional point of view, ALPI interfaces |4 and |5 are
Of RTE and SE respectively.
ALPI provides the |4 interface in the case of Basic Integrity Level FA. (see REQ-ALPI-011)

ALPI provides the |5 interface in the case of Safety Integrity Level FA that require the use ofa Safety
Environment that ensures SIL using composite safety mechanisms. (see REQ-ALPI-012)
ALPI also, through |4 and |5, allows:
the interaction of FAs with the communication system, via platform, towards the |06 interface
that manages communication with other FAs and external systems
the interaction of FAs With the |1 interface and the entities outside the platform, for the
management of activities related

7.4.6.2 Messaging
Exchanging information via messages is a key service of the platform. The messaging concept shall
follow the below
paradigms:
Location transparency: It shall be transparent to a Task of a Functional Application Whether
计 is
communicating to a local entity (i.e., residing on the same local platform instance) or a
remote entity (i.e., residing on a remote platform instance);
Replication transparency: It shall be transparent to Tasks ofa Functional Application Whether
they themselves, and the Tasks of the Functional Application
are exchanging messages
with, are replicated or not;
Authentication and authorization transparency: Authentication and authorization of entities
shall be transparent to
Tasks of a
Functional Application, so that Tasks of a
Functional
Application can trust that the entities they are receiving messages from
or transmitting
messages to are the entities they claim to be;
Messages between Tasks ofa Functional Application or with Tasks of another Functional Application

A Bi-directional Messaging Relation can be used for requests from the requesting Task
once both sides have joined the Messaging Relation。
characteristics:
Posted messages shall be received by the receiver in the exact same order as they have

sent by the responder;
The platform shall deliver messages (both requests and responses) exactly once depending
on the
performance achievable by the MPC implementation7
It is to be investigated the
impact of this need on the design and architecture, and the possibility to adopt less stringent
constraints, consistent with safety requirements
Messages shall be time-stamped, so that the involved Tasks are able to determine how old
messages are, and whether
should still process or discard them, etc
The platform shall inform the requesting Task when the responding Task has joined the
Messaging Relation (for the first time, or, e.9., after a crash)
7.4.6.3
Task and Thread Scheduling
Platform implementations shall have the maximum freedom regarding the scheduling of Tasks of
Functional Applications, as
as 3 minimum set of design principles are met:
Task replicas and their threads shall be scheduled based on the following kinds of triggers
(or combinations of theses):
timer-based, i.e , in configured regular intervals, orin the form of one-shot timers;
event-based,i.e.
upon receipt of (certain types of messages);
timer- and event-based, i.e., the Task obtains execution time in regular intervals, orin
the form of one-shot timers, only if (certain types of) messages have (orhave not) been
received.
(see REQ-ALPI-028)
7.4.6.4
Time
7.4.6.4.1
Timestamps and Task replication
The platform shall be able to provide timestamps With the following three different quality attributes:
Unsynchronized Timestamp: corresponds to the time at the point when the replica requests this (and
for Which different replicas of the same Task may obtain a different
result)。
Synchronized Timestamp:

more expensive than
more imprecise ones。
This has an impact on
requirements and development。
Tasks must ensure that

7.4.6.4.2
Timestamps and Messages
For safety as well as for availability reasons, it is essential for Tasks that messages are not delayed
beyond
a defined maximum message delivery time。
The platform shall supervise the message
delivery time and inform interested Tasks in case the maximum message delivery time is exceeded.
The platform shall complement messages exchanged via Messaging Relations with timestamps,
allowing receiving Tasks to make decisions based on the age of a received message and possibly
take appropriate action。
To calculate the age of a
message,
te
notion of synchronized platform clocks (also among
distributed platforms) is necessary. Whether messages are complemented with relative or absolute
timestamps is for further study.
7.4.6.5 Gateway Concept
To enable Functional Applications to communicate with external entities,
3
gateway concept is
required . platform internal communication, i.e.
communication between Tasks running on the same
platform, uses Messaging Relations as described in the pervious chapter。 In order to exchange
information between Tasks running on different platforms, a gateway is necessary. (see REQ-ALPI-

7.4.6.7
Communication Model
The ALPI interface assumes that communications made via the platform, using the |0 interface, are
not within the scope of this document。
With reference to Figure 47, the FA performs processing on input data and produces output results
thatare managed through a communication system . Communication can take place either within the
FS or with other external FAs or systems. In order to facilitate and standardize the development of
the application, the ALPI interface shall provide a single model of communication services that make
i transparent to the FA whether the peer node is internal to the FS or it belongs to another external
System. The information that defines the node type, and therefore that allows the RTE layers to
implement
the
communication
correctly,
is
specified
in
the  configuration
of
ALPl
The
communication services provided by ALPI, after appropriate configuration, allow to implement with
a Single standard model, every elementary communication between the basic components (FAT)
constituting an FA。
ALPI communication interface is based on platform services based on messages as described in
chapter 7.4.6.2.
7.4.7
Certification
The discussion around this aspect of application-level platform independence has not started
However, there is a dedicated subsequenttask in this Work package to study certification approaches
for modular platforms。
7.4.8
Safety
The MCP allows the management of non-safety related, Basic Integrity Level, and safety-related up
to SIL4 Functional Applications。 In the case of non-safety related FAs, the
FA

7.6 CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK
While previous work and the discussions outlined in this chapter already show on a high level What
a future modular platform could look like, there is still a lot of work needed to create a coherent and
useful concept for the ALPI
the Application-level Platform Independence。
The goals of independence, standardization and ease of use for the definition of the ALPI interface
pose new challenges that imply assumptions for a correct compromise with the complexity of a
modular platform. Based on the reported description, it was found that the common definition of the
14 interface is influenced by the following factors:
Level of independence of ALPI: The common high-level description of ALPI highly depends
on the choice of RTE。
In case of a single RTE provider, the description of the |4 interface
coincides with that of the
RTE itself; in
case Of RTE from different suppliers, a specific
adaptation interface for each RTE should be provided in addition.
Level of transparency for safety: based on What is provided by the Safety Environment;
15
should provide complete transparency about consolidations required for up to SIL4 orin any
case a minimum set of runtime services. Complete transparency implies a clear definition of
the SIL of inputloutput data at configuration time。

Level of transparency for security: security communication is not taken in account by ALPI,
being managed end-to-end by the underlying layers. ALPI, during the configuration phase
must allow the selection of appropriate security-oriented protocols to be implemented by
lower levels.
Deployment;
maintenance:

is
primarily
3
runtime
interface,
SO
deployment
and
maintenance is delegated to specific tools provided by the RTE at FS level. In this case, ALPI
requires a configuration data structure for the aggregation of the basic components。
The
aggregation is managed at FS level。
Possible choices for further simplifications and standardizations: the descriptions of |4 and 15 are
based on the safety integrity level of services. It is possible either an incremental approach in which
3
safety-related FA uses |4 by default and adds |5 for the part involving the SE, orit uses an |5 that
integrates a restricted |4, in congruence With the target SIL
Up to 4.
The definition
Of the requirements in the appendix Was
made
on the
basis of an independent
approach, Which however also took into account the results of the solutions proposed in chapters 6
and 8_
7.6.1
Open points
7.6.1.1
RTE Singlelmulti provider
ALPIs scope is to propose a common high level API description. This can be facilitated through the
choice ofa single RTE provider. In the case of different RTEs, ALPIs Will have to include "adapters'
and the management of the associated complexities. The choice to impose any constraints on the
RTE provider, in order to simplify the implementation of ALPI, should be evaluated in consideration
ofthe trade-off between flexibility in the choice of multi supplier and the related additional complexity
associated with the introduction of "adapters" for RTEs harmonization.
7.6.1.2
Consistent safety
With reference to safety management, the modularity and independence of the ALPI SW from the
MPC are not sufficient and it is necessary to introduce an overall safety mechanism to ensure that
the safe system is consistent That is, to ensure that a change of version of ALPI, both |4 and |5,is
congruent with the SE. This mechanism must be considered in the ALPI configuration data structure.

8 MANAGEMENT, DIAGNOSTICS AND SECURITY RELATED
INTERFACES
This chapter deals With platform management, diagnostics and security related interfaces;
either
internal
tO
the platform,
Or
external to
the platform,
the
latter being referred
to
35
"11" (see
Chapters 3.7.1 and 5).
The interfaces are important for integration and interoperability of modular
platforms into the railways' computing landscape and operations. The interfaces discussed here are
platform-centric and do explicitly not cater to the needs of the functional
applications executed on
such a modular platform.
8.1 OVERVIEW ON THE INTERFACES
An overview on the stated interfaces is provided in Figure 56

Description
As shown in Figure 49, the CEME is expected to be 100% Commercial-of-the-
shelf (COTS), except for the Native Hardware Access (NHA) function that may
potentially not be COTS and that is required by the Safety Environments to
support Functional Systems with a SIL level。
Functional Systemfs)
Functional System(s) are defined in chapters 3.7.2 and 5. In the context of the
interfaces covered in this chapter, it is important to note that the Functional
Systems(s) are expected to contain:
FS Diagnostics Server: Entity running in a dedicated Compartment
andlor together with a Functional Application in an FS Compartment;
Which provides diagnostics information to the Platform Management and
to Shared Services
FS Update Client: Entity running in a dedicated Compartment or
together with a Functional Application in an FS Compartment, which
responds to and executes update requests from the Platform
Management or Shared Services
Shared Services
Shared Services are standardized services related to IT security (e.9.
authentication, certificate management), global time provisioning, diagnostics
and configuration management
update that are located outside the platform.
Platform
This entity supervises the operation of the Functional Systems running on the
Management
Virtual Computing Elements in one (or multiple) location(s), e.9. data centre(s). It
obtains diagnostics information from the FS Diagnostics Server within the
Functional Systems and from the Hardware and Virtualisation related
Diagnostics Functions within the CEME. It forwards the information, as
appropriate; to the Shared Services via |1-DIAG and reacts by triggering
appropriate actions, e.9., the creation of new Virtual Computing Elements inside
the Virtualisation Environment or
restarting Physical Computing Elements if
needed.
Note: The Platform Management is not safety-relevant (but ensures the
fulfilment of RAM requirements during operation ), as the Functional Systems
themselves (and the Safety Environments therein) always ensure a safe state
and safe output. It is assumed that the Platform Management provides a highly
standardized functionality in the way that it reacts to information arriving via
CEME-DIAG andlor MGMT-DIAG by triggering actions via ORCH andlor FS-
UPDATEin a standardized way, potentially
involving FS-specific policies。
The Platform Management implements the MPC specific interfaces and
abovementioned functionality, potentially utilising as much as feasible COTS
solutions, e.9. , OpenStack or other solutions。

also because they terminate at different entities
and refer to different layers in the technology stack:
The
CEME-DIAG interface

and
the
Platform Management,
conveying diagnostics information related to hardware, the Virtualization Environment;
Virtual Computing Elements etc.
The MGMT-DIAG interface is between the FS Diagnostics Server and the Platform
Management, conveying diagnostics information obtained from the application domain。
8.2 GENERAL ASSUMPTIONS ON THE INTERFACES
It is important to note that the aforementioned interfaces are all assumed to be not safety relevant。
Their failure may have an impact on the availability of a Modular Computing Platform (e.9. , because
the Platform Management is not able to correctly react to
3
hardware
Or
software failure), but
mechanisms in the Functional Systems (orin the Safety Layer therein) always ensure that safety is
fulfilled.
Regarding updates of Functional Systems and the usage of the I-UPDATE and FS-UPDATE
interfaces it is also important to note that at this point two proposals shall be provided as potential
options for further study:
a)
Shared
Services
could
directly
interface
to
the
FS
Update
Clients
in
the
FS
Compartments via |1-UPDATE to trigger updates of Functional Systems (Compartments).
This requires that Shared Services are aware that Functional Systems run in the form of
redundant replicas
in
multiple
FS Compartments
and
need
potentially
awareness
Of
constraints or procedures that have to be considered for the update of these (for instance
FS Compartments may have to be stopped, updated and started in a certain order or with
certain timing constraints, etc. ). In this case, the Platform Management needs to be informed
about any
FS Compartment updates triggered by the Shared
Services;
SO that i
Can
supervise needed activities appropriately (and forinstance correctly trigger the re-creation of
3
Virtual Computing Element)
when FS Compartment failures
are
reported through the
MGMT-DIAG interface.
b)
Shared Services interface to the Platform Management and direct
requests
related to Functional Systems to the Platform Management. In this case, the Shared Services
need not be aware of the deployment of replicas and FS Compartments,
but rather See
3
Functional System as one atomic entitity that can be
updated as a Whole based on provided

update
any

Contract No. HE

Suropes Rail
information. The Platform Management, being aware of the notion of FS Compartments and
the related FS Deployment Rules, can then translate update requests from Shared Services
into
3
sequence
of requests
Via
FS_UPDATE
to
te
FS
Update
Clients
in
the
FS
Compartments, also taking into account FS Deployment Rule specific timing constraints, etc.
Which of such options is to be used (or whether both would possibly be used concurrently orin
combination) needs further investigation。
It is assumed that option a) above introduced higher
demands on the |1-UPDATE interface specified in the TCCS domain, as the Shared Services need
to apply configuration and software updates of Functional Systems, e.9., running in data centres on
a different granularity and with different constraints than when performing configuration updates of,
e.9., field elements as currently foreseen. Option b) may require less complexity on the |1-UPDATE
interface specified in the TCCS domain, as the Platform Management, where the interface would
terminate on the platform side, Would supervise the implementation, managing their complexity and
constraints.
8.3 REQUIREMENTS ON THE INTERFACES
The requirements
for
the
interfaces
mentioned
Can
be
found
in Appendix
0, Management;
Diagnostics and Security related Interface Requirements。
The requirements for interfaces being part of |1 (e.9., |1-DIAG, |1-UPDATE, I-SEC) are not in the
scope Of work package 26. These interfaces are specified in the System Pillar TCCS domain.
It is
assumed that the modular platform concept and the entities described in this chapter would reuse
the |I-DIAG and II-SEC as they are considered in the TCCS domain so far, without posing MPC-
specific requirements. However, it is still to be checked, ideally in the dialogue between R2DATO
and the TCCS domain in the System Pillar whether this is indeed the case
For the |1-UPDATE,
as stated in Section 8.2, further investigations
are required
Wrt。
how this
interface is used in concurrence with FS-UPDATE. From this investigation, further requirements on
I1-UPDATE may be derived that would have to be considered in the TCCS domain.
8.4 CONCLUSIONS AND NEXT STEPS
This chapter has delved into platform management; diagnostics and security related interfaces。
A
distinction has been drawn between interfaces within the CPI -
Compatible Platform Implementation
(ORCH
CEME-DIAG, FS-UPDATE, MGMT-DIAG) and those toward Shared Services external to
the CPI (I1-DIAG, I1-SEC, II-UPDATE).
For the interfaces within the CPI, requirements have been derived. The common understanding is
that
The interfaces from the Platform Management to the Functional Systems
MGMTDIAGand
FS-UPDATE
are
specific to the MPC and can be specified exactly according to the identified
MPCneeds. Here, the next steps are to further develop the conceptand subsequently identify
suitable existing protocols for these interfaces and specify the interfaces in detail;
The
interfaces  from
te
Platform
Management
to
the
Compartment
Execution
and
Management Environment (CEME)
ORCH and CEME DIAG
are
expected to be based
on
existing interfaces provided by existing COTS implementations of the CEME. Here, there
is hence no degree of freedom to specify these interfaces, but it rather has to be checked
whether existing COTS solutions fulfill the requirements on these interfaces identified in this

deliverable. At the time of writing of this deliverable, there is confidence that there are multiple
COTS solutions on the market that can meet the requirements, but a detailed (gap) analysis
has to be performed.
For the interfaces from the CPIto the Shared Services
I1-UPDATE, I1-DIAG and I1-SEC -i has
to be discussed with the ERJU System Pillar TCCS domain, as noted in Sections 8.2 and 8.3, how
these interfaces are exactly to be used in the MPC context, and whether additional requirements
may be posed on these from the MPC context beyond the requirements already considered in the
TCCS domain.

9 CONCLUSIONS
Modular computing platforms
are
a proven concept in many
area5,
and
this
SUcCeSS already
motivated many endeavours to enable their usage in the railway domain [18].
Work package 26,
within the environmentof ERJU Innovation Pillar Focus Project 2 R2DATO, applied the state-of-the-
art to the input and the guidance from the ERJU System Pillar, most importantly from the Computing
Environment domain, and elaborated on important, railway specific aspects.
This activity created the "Modular Platform Concept" (MPC), Which is presented in detail in this
deliverable. The analysis and concept work are expected to further contribute to ERJU SP progress,
supporting the domains in defining a suitable environment for modular platforms to be commissioned
in the future.
The
MPC is presented
with
3
basic analysis (see chapter 3,
35
high-level requirements (see
chapter 4 respectively Appendix A), and the architecture concept (chapter 5).
The MPC is built on
three internal ideas (HLPI,ALPI, and respective interfaces; see chapters 6
7
and 8)and provides
external interfaces for operational integration as specified by ERJU System Pillar。
The overall outcome has two facets: Modular platforms as the MPC are feasible in the railway
context. However, the complexity of a fully defined MPC for safety functions set limits to the depth
of specification that can be presented here. As well, it's an ongoing discussion What actual level of
definition respectively harmonization of a platform keeps the right balance between interchange-
ability and potential for future innovation and differentiation。
As such, the specification presented is not final and implementable in a
Way that Would fulfil all
variants of interchangeability , nor would a final & fixed specification have been advantageous at the
time this deliverable
Was to be finished。
This is due to several dependencies and implications;
content- and timewise:
final specification is expected to describe platform implementations that are certifieable
and allow for modularity in a way that enables the stated goals. This will be analysed in work
package 26's next task and its results will further guide the MPC specification.
The input received from the System Pillar Was limited to information received via the FP2
Cluster System engineer respectively
via direct contacts
in
the appropriate
ERJU
SP
domains. This input Was not stable and changed regularly.
When this deliverable Was due
there were no published inputs from the relevant SP domains。
The input
from
the
SP
CE
domain
35
Shown
in chapter 3.7.1
Was
in
some aspects
unexpected and did not align With the goals of all of work package 26's members。
The
approach planned in work package 26's first deliverable [18] was not fully compatible with
the input received from the CE domain [14], especially the introduction and prioritization of 12
and |3, as Well as the different design of |1 were not expected. On one hand, the increasing
scope helped the definition of ALPIand HLPI,as introduced in Work package 26's second
deliverable
and
explained
in
detail in
this
current deliverable。
On
the other hand,
the
complexity similarly rose. Continous alignment with the SP CE domain helped to steer work
package 26 into the right direction.
The SPCE domain conclusion and final output on the computing environmentis likely several
years out。

While it was not expected to be available in the timeframe, it's still relevant to note that there
is no input yet, e.9.in the form of requirements, coming from any application in the R2DATO
context that would target the MPC.
In the environment described in the bullet points above, it's not feasible to decide on a clear
strategy for standardization approaches in the MPC.
The goal of interchangeability can be
reached
on many different granularities and
levels。
Not limiting future
innovation
While
creating beneficial harmonizations in the architecture andlor interface realms, however, is a
hard requirement for future adoption of the MPC. Existing developments in the sector have
to betaken into account, and a good and informed compromise needs to be found. One option
is to gain the necessary knowledge and drive the adoption in demonstrator projects, such as
the "Onboard Platform Demonstrator" work package 36 in R2DATO, the demonstrator cluster
of R2DATO in general;
and future phases of R2DATO respectively ERJU. Another option
could be to collect insights from incumbent platform vendors and design the MPC interfaces
accordingly. This has last option naturally has been applied to this deliverable already, as the
authors of the relevant chapters have insights into their companies experiences in this field.
Despite all these factors and caveats, this deliverable shows a concrete and complete picture of the
Modular Platform Concept highlighting many important considerations, requirements, approaches
for Safety and security, and enables the sourcing of relevant core technologies as commercial-off
the-shelf (COTS) products.

enabling decoupled security driven updates is an inherent strength of the MPC.
4)
Approaches for Safely
the MPC goal to minimize the areas With functional safety integrity levels above Basic
Integrity While still providing an up to SIL4 capable environment two approaches have been
compared: HLPIand ALPI.
The
HLPI safety discussion
motivates certain
measures that have to be implemented to
support the required safety capabilities in a virtualized environment; see chapter 6.7. The key
challenge is the decoupling or harmonization of the SRACs of the Safety Environment in the
AEE from the actual implementation details of the CEE respectively CEME. Proposals for
this challenge, like the motivation of the so-called 'Native Hardware Access'
(NHA), have
been made and show potential ways forward.
For ALPI, the |5 interface presents an opportunity for decoupling Functional Applications with
SIL greater 0 from the underlying layers。
The discussion can be found in chapter 7 _
5)
SourcingOf COIScomponents
The opportunities to source platform-defining components
as COTS without the need to
develop new technologies or products is a clear advantage of the MPC.
As highlighted in
chapters 5.1.1 and 6,COTS hardware for the Physical Computing Environment can be used
in the
MPC,
35
Well
as COTS virtualisation solutions can
be
Used for the CEME。
The
adaptation of special properties or interfaces of the COTS components is achieved by
introducing the Platform Management (PM) component within MPC.
The PM enables the
adaptation of ERJU-driven external interfaces (11) and Functional System specific internal
interfaces (see chapter 8) to the CEME。
The CEME interfaces are depending on the COTS
solutions integrated into an actual Compatible Platform Implementation (CPI). With the PM,
all variants of CPI behave the same way externally and provide the same interfaces (11).
Detailed technical analyses and further information including respective conclusions can be found in
the appropriate chapters。
A
comprehensive collection of open points is available in Appendix E。
In summary, this deliverable lays the foundation for the Modular Platform Concept, MPC, prominently
enabling  capabilities
Such

(MPC-POI),
consolidation of more software on less hardware (MPC-POG), and extensibility (MPC-PO4) in

0#
Where multiple Functional Applications are present, the MPC shall execute Functional Applications independent of their
MSCP-
individual SIL.
20
Rationale:
The SIL can be mixed within Functional Systems and across multiple Functional Systems and its Functional
Applications. The MPC implementations have to support arbitrary mixed SIL within their limitations of maximum
SIL.
尽903
0#
The MPC shall conform to the interface specification of the System Pillar Computing environment domain。

Where application-level platform independence is used, the MPC shall transparently encapsulate the safety and fault
MSCP.
tolerance mechanism.
23
Rationale:
All safety-related functions not inherent in the application logic shall be implemented as part of the platform. As
platform vendors may use their specific approaches to handling safety and fault tolerance, it must be fully
encapsulated in the platform. Applications must not include any platform specific code related to safety or fault
tolerance:

The MPC vendor shall be responsible to ensure (by provision of tooling, documentation, generic product certification, etc )
MSCP-
that a solution using the platform is certifiable according to CENELEC without the explicit involvement of the Computing
29
Platform vendor。
Rationale:
Afull decoupling of the life-cycles of the Computing Platform and the Functional Applications requires thata
deployment of Platform and Applications can be homologated without the explicit involvement of the
Computing Platform vendor。
Satisfies:
MPC-P07, MPC-LO2
尽o7
0#
The Application vendor shall be responsible to ensure, by providing all required artefacts, that a Functional System can be
MSCP
integrated on a MPC and homologated without the explicit involvement of the Application vendor。
89
Rationale:
Afull decoupling of the life-cycles of the MPC and the Functional Systems requires that a deployment of
Platform and Applications resp. Systems can be homologated without the explicit involvement of the
application(s) resp. System(s) vendor(s)。
Satisfies:
MPC P07, MPC-LO2
尽008
0#
Where application-level platform independence is used, the MPC shall define a unified set of safety related application
MSCP
conditions (SRACs) (at least to the extent that
relate directly to the Functional System) Which all safety critical
28
Functional Systems must comply With in order to be certifiable according to CENELEC safety standards。
Rationale:
In order to be able to
Functional Systems from one Platform implementation to another; i is
thatall
Platform implementations delegate the exact same set of safety related application conditions to the Functional
Systems. Otherwise; Functional Systems would have to be modified to comply with different conditions on
different platform implementations。

The MPC shall meet the relevant security system requirements as defined by the System Pillar Cyber Security domain。
MSCP.
Rationale:
Using a standards-based approach, ensures that adequate controls, processes and procedures are in place to
30
ensure the protection of the platform confidentiality, integrity and availability。
Remark:
The standards situation is being cleared up and the relevant guidelines are expected from the System Pillar。
For the HLPI approach, additional investigations can become necessary. IEC 62443:2013 SL3 can be
assumed to be the baseline。
尽019
The MPC shall ensure the authentication and authorisation of Functional Systems。
MSCP.
Rationale:
The Platform has to ensure that only authenticated Functional Systems and their components can use the
109
platform. Further Functional Systems and their components need to be able to trust that the entities they are
receiving messages from or transmitting messages to are the entities
claim to be.
尽011
The MPC shall ensure independence (e.9., in CPU and memory usage) between Functional System components to fulfil
MSCP.

Rationale:
This is
required for CENELEC compliance EN 50129:2018 or later。
尽012
0#
The MPC shall offer a management interface to set a Functional System to be active or inactive Where inactive means that

Rationale:
The operations accessible from the outside ofa platform are on the Functional System level。
尽013
0#
The MPC shall provide the Functional System the ability to report that it needed to deactivate itself。
MSCP-
Rationale:
Functional System might see the need to deactivate itself due to safety goals not being met. The MPC needs
33
to be aware of this change:
尽014
The MPC shall provide a management interface on which information is provided when a Functional System changes state。

Rationale:
Determinism is paramount in a safety critical environment. Therefore;, each relevant Functional System
component must have a defined execution period (scheduling: time interval).
尽020
0#
Where application-level platform independence is used, the MPC shall be able to assign deterministic execution behaviour
MSCP.
to relevant Functional System components triggered by an one-shot-timer event。

This is required to fulfil the norm EN 50129:2018.
尽025
Where application-level platform independence is used, the MPC shall monitor whether a Functional System component is
MSCP-
able to conclude processing within a defined time period。
118
Rationale:
It is important that Functional System components can conclude on processing, e.9. , incoming messages
within a certain CPU resource:
The platform has to monitor this to be able to potentially react。

尽031
The MPC shall allow time synchronisation with an external time server via standard protocols。
MSCP.
Rationale:
Time synchronisation aims to coordinate otherwise independent clocks. Even when initially set accurately; real
55 &53
clocks will differ after some amount of time due to clock drift; caused by clocks counting time at slightly different
rates。
The usage of standardised protocols ensure compatibility, interoperability, simplify product development
and speed up time-to-market。
尽032
0
The MPC shall include a monitoring and diagnostics interface accessible locally and via remote connection.
MSCP-
Rationale:
In order to analyse the system behaviour and performance during development, test and operation, a
60
diagnostics interface is needed between Computing Platform deployments and the MDCM (Monitoring;
Diagnostics, Configuration, and Maintenance).
尽033
0#
Where application-level platform independence is used, the MPC shall support monitoring of the execution of Functional
MSCP-
System components, for instance by capturing KPIs related memory usage, processor load, etc。
59
Rationale:
To support fault analysis as well as to monitor proper operation of deployed system。
尽034
The MPC shall be able to provide logging and tracing information to an external entity.
MSCP.
Rationale:
Logging and tracing are critical when analysing system behaviour and faults. Having a unified logging and
84
tracing concept dramatically simplifies the analysis。
尽035
The MPC shall provide safe and secure mechanism to
the run-time environment locally and remotely.
MSCP-
Rationale:
The ability of updating the platform software is essential. To minimize maintenance cost, the normal update
67 &66
deployment mechanism shall be remotely (e.9., over-the-air) with no need for physical presence of any
maintenance personnel on site (e.9., on the train). In case remote updates fail forany reason, i must be
possible to perform local updates with physical access to the MPC. Updates shall be uploaded via industry
standard interfaces。
Remark:
Remote updates must not affect the proper operation of MPCs and might need explicit planned scheduling to
be
applied。

69 &64
Rationale:
The ability of updating Functional Systems as a Whole or some of their components is essential. To minimize
maintenance cost; the normal update deployment mechanism shall be remotely (e.9., over-the-air) with no
need for physical presence of any maintenance personnel on site (e.9., on the train). In case remote updates
fail forany reason, it must be possible to perform local updates with physical access to the MPC. Updates shall
be uploaded via industry standard interfaces。
Remark:
Software updates of the Functional System are performed by the platform, but software updates of entities
controlled by the Functional System are in the responsibility of the Functional System itself (e.9., update of field
elements).
