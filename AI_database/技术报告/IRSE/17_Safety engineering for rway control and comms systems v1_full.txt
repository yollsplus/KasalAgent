Risk Analysis
Systematic identification of hazards generally involves two phases:
Risk Evaluation
an empirical phase (exploiting past experience, e.8. checklists)
a
deductive phase (proactive forecasting, e.8. brain-storming,
structured What-if studies, HAZOP; FMEA).
Hazard Control consists of a number ofactivities Which can be

Risk Acceptance
Risk acceptance criteria depend on national or international legislative requirements。
The Common Safety Method (CSM) promoted by the European Rail Agency (ERA) recognises three risk
acceptance principles:
use Of a code of practice;
use of a similar system as a reference;
explicit risk estimation (here the ERA says "The acceptability of the estimated risks shall be evaluated
using risk acceptance criteria either derived from or based on legal requirements stated in Community
legislation orin notified national rules").
In the UK the legal requirement (Health & Safety at Work Act) is that risk should be made as low as reasonably
practicable (the ALARP principle

see next pagel。
In
practice the CSM and ALARP principles are convergent, as use Of a relevant industry code of practice or use

Engineering Safety Management
Safety Management can be defined as the organisational measures applied to ensure that an acceptable level
of safety is maintained throughout the life of a system. It has much in common with Quality Management:
both are concerned with the avoidance of IosS.
What distinguishes Safety Management from Quality Management, or from the principles of good
management in general, is that Safety Management must concern itself with events Which are sufficiently
improbable to be ignored by other aspects of management. For this reason hazard identification and risk
assessment are prominent components of Safety Management。
The respective contributions of Quality Management and Safety Management to the safety of a system can be
simply stated as follows: Quality Management ensures that the system does What was intended, While Safety
Management ensures that What was intended was safe。

Safety Management and Safety Integrity
The standards for safety-related electronjc systems and software place particular emphasis on two aspects of
engineering safety management: INDEPENDENCE and DOCUMENTATION.
Independence of Roles
Many roles Within an organisation, such as Verifier, tester; Validator or assessor, are concerned with confirming
the safety of What has been produced by other roles, such as designers and installers. Independence between
such roles may be required i order to reduce the probability of people in different roles suffering from the
same misconceptions or making the same mistakes.
It is also important that people in roles which involve

Documentation
To engineer is essentially to generate or transform information, and engineering is a social activity involving
collaboration and exchanges'between individuals and organisations.
Engineers work primarily with their
brains, and documentation is the medium through Which the product ofthis Work is recorded and shared with

Why Safety Cases?
In a
Safety Case regime the Developer has to demonstrate that the
system is safe。
This is potentially more effective than relying on the Assessor or
Approver investigating the system to find out ifit is safe。
With complex systems only the Developer has sufficient knowledge of
the system to produce the evidence of safety

Part 2: Achieving Safety Integrity

What is Safety Integrity?
Safety Integrity is defined as the likelihood of a system satisfactorily
performing the required safety functions under all the stated
conditions within a stated period oftime。
The expression "required safety functions
includes the function of
reverting to a safe state in the event of a failure。
To achieve acceptable safety integrity we need to know Why failures
occur and how components and systems behave in the event of failure。
Failures relevant to safety are commonly classified as being either
random or systematic。

Random and Systematic:
From the point of view of the user, all failures are
random.Ifit was known when they would occur
Failures
could be prevented or avoided.
The failure of physical components is determined by the

Designing to Take Account of Failure
In general, failures classified as "random" are those whose rate of occurrence cannot be made low enough to
provide to provide sufficient assurance of safety. For such failures safety is assured by means of the fail-safe
principle, which can be defined as "a design property of signalling equipment, and ofthe system within Which
it is used, that under failure conditions Will provide safety for traffic"
In
practice this is achieved by constructing signalling systems from subsystems or components having well-
defined predictable failure modes and ensuring that failure states correspond to restrictive traffic conditions。
Fail-safety, can be achieved in three different Ways:
Inherent fail-safety, where the system or subsystem is designed so that any credible failure mode of
ofits component parts will result in a restrictive state。
Composite fail-safety. With this technique, each safety-related function is performed by at least twWo
items. Each of these items shall be independent from all others, to avoid common-cause failures. Non-
restrictive activities can progress only ifthe necessary numbers ofitems agree。
Reactive fail-safety. This technique allows a safety-related function to be performed by a single item,
provided its safe operation is ensured by rapid detection and negation of any hazardous fault by
anotheritem.

Inherent Fail-Safety: The Signalling Relay
The fail-safe characteristics of the signalling relay are at
the heart of almost all classical electrical signalling
safety. In British signal engineering practice the principal
relay safety characteristics are an armature and contact
operating mechanism with sufficient restoring forces
from gravity and spring pressure to ensure that it will
release When the coil is de-energised, and non-weldable
contacts formed from mating and silver-impregnated
carbon
Signalling circuitry using such relays is designed so that

relays are required to be energised to enable a
'proceed" signal aspect to be given. Any failure, such as
a broken wire or high-resistance contact, Will cause one
or more relays in the circuit concerned to de-energise,
in Which case a restrictive signal aspect will be
displayed.

Composite and Reactive Fail-Safety
Inherent fail-safety is difficult to achieve in electronic systems because they generally comprise a large number
of electronic components With a wide variety of possible failure modes, so that it is not feasible to design so
that no credible failure mode of any component will result in an unsafe state.
Inherent fail-safety has been achieved for relatively simple electronic devices, such as the transmitter and
receiver units of audio frequency track circuits, but for more complex applications based on microprocessors
and other large-scale integrated electronic components, for example signal interlockings, composite or reactive
fail-safety, or often a blend of the two, is almost always the preferred solution.
Both techniques depend on there being a very low probability of simultaneous failures in independent parts of
the overall system. This calls for the system design to ensure that the time to detect and react to individual
failures is sufficiently short. It is also necessary to ensure that inherent fail-safety will be achieved with regard
to common-cause failures which might result in multiple simultaneous failures。

The SIL Concept
The concept of SIL (Safety Integrity Level) was introduced early in the development of standards
for safety related software because there was no way of measuring the probability of unsafe
failure of software。
There is still no way of measuring this probability。
Although it is not possible to determine a numerical value for the probability of failure, it is
reasonable to believe that if more effective design and Verification & Validation methods are
used, the probability will be lower。
If the best possible methods are used, the software will have the highest possible safety integrity。
It was decided to have four categories of method, so that SIL 4is the highest possible.
The SIL concept has been extended from software to cover all types of systematic failure, such as
errors in
requirements, design errors and manufacturing errors。
