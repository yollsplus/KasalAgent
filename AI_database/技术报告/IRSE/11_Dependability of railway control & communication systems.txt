Dependability v4

Dependability
•Composed of 4 elements (giving the RAMS 
acronym):
•Reliability  - the probability that the item will deliver its required function 
when required.
•Availability  - the proportion of time for which the item is in a state to 
perform its required function.
•Maintainability  - the ease with which an item is kept in working order or 
repaired.
•Safety  - freedom from unacceptable risk of harm.
Security is sometimes considered separately and cuts across 
the 4 elements above.
Dependability v4
Maintenance
•Once the system has been designed, installed and tested, 
MAINTENANCE is the process that keeps the system 
DEPENDABLE.  It can consist of processes such as visual 
inspection, adjustment, lubrication, renewal of parts, 
testing.
•Preventive Maintenance  - to keep the item safe and reliable (usually on a pre-
determined schedule). 
•Predictive Maintenance -preventive maintenance that is only done when the item is 
predicted to fail or become unsafe (e.g. from remote condition monitoring data). 
•Reactive (or Curative, or Corrective) Maintenance (or Repairs) -restoring the item to 
working order once it has failed or has a defective part. 
•Renewals –Replacing items before they become worn, unreliable or unsafe. 
preventive maintenance is usually most valuable on items with moving 
parts in a severe environment (e.g. points machines) 
Dependability v4
Reliability
Reliability
•The probability that the item will deliver its required function 
when required.
•Delivery of correct functions when in service (Will it work 
when it is needed?)
oOften measured as Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF).  This formula gives a 
good approximation
oMTBF = Length of Time / Number of Failures in that time
oe.g.  At population level, for 120 items, there are 50 failures in a year.  The 
average MTBF for an individual item is 120/50 = 2.4 years. 
oThis will typically be measured in years for elements of a railway system (e.g. 
radio transmitter, track circuit), but lower for whole systems.
oMTTF (Mean Time To Failure) is a very similar measure used for non-repairable 
systems 
Dependability v4
Some causes of poor Reliability
•Poor design (e.g. software bug, component not resilient)
•Maintenance issues not considered at design stage (cost or 
time pressure?)
•Poor build or installation (e.g. “nicked” wires, stripped 
insulation, inherent weaknesses)
•Poor maintenance (e.g. weakness or fault left after last 
intervention, deficiency not detected at last routine test or 
visit)
•Abusive operation
•External (e.g. severe weather, power outage, physical 
damage, electromagnetic interference)
•Electronics affected by the tough rail environment
•Failure to learn from past failures !
Dependability v4
Examples of root causes of poor 
Reliability
•Track circuits (with typical symptoms)
•Flooded or contaminated ballast (track showing occupied when 
clear, or variation in test readings)
•Poor insulation of track fixings  (track showing occupied when clear)
•Failure of Insulated Rail Joint (IRJ) (track showing occupied when 
clear)
•Railhead contamination (failing to detect a train)
•Points (with typical symptoms)
•Unstable track (loss of detection –intermittent or permanent)
•Lineside equipment
•Electromagnetic interference
•Vibration
•Temperature
•Humidity
Dependability v4
Examples of Good Reliability
•A highly reliablesignalling system:
•Will ideally never fail (though may have internal faults or 
deliver degraded outputs)
•Will self-diagnose internal faults before they cause a 
failure of the system (e.g. remote condition monitoring)
•Will cope with the real world railway operating 
environment (both normal and abnormal)
•Few single points of failure
•Will cope with possible failures in other systems  (e.g. 
power supply failures or minor interruptions)
Dependability v4
Availability
Availability
•The proportion of time for which the item is in a state to perform its 
required function.
•Continuity of correct service (For how much of the time is it usable?)
At its simplest if can be expressed as:
Availability = Uptime / (Uptime + Downtime)
This is the equivalent of:
Availability = MTTF / (MTTF + MTTR)
Where MTTF is Mean Time to Failure (or use MTBF instead)
and MTTR is Mean Time to Repair  (from time of failure to rectification).
Planned outages need to be counted as failure incidents
This will typically be nearly 100% for most items of railway equipment, but lower for 
whole systems. Any unplanned system availability less than 100% causes loss and 
customer dissatisfaction.
Dependability v4
Some effects on Availability
Negative
•Intrusive preventive maintenance 
•Taking system out of service (planned)
•System out of service because of failure
•Restricting train movements to safeguard staff
Positive
•Duplication of system components or back-up systems 
(can increase availability without component reliability 
being increased)
Dependability v4
Examples of Good Availability
•A highly available signalling system:
•will work 24/7 (or all traffic hours)
•any maintenance routines do not need the system to be 
taken out of service
•will continue to deliver at least minimum functionality in 
the events of faults
•fault rectification does not need the system to be taken 
out of service
•does not require any work on the lineside
Dependability v4
Maintainability and some issues 
affecting it
Maintainability  - the ease with which an item is kept 
in working order or repaired.
•Weather protection for maintenance staff
•Ergonomics
•Easy or zero maintenance routines
•Workflow on mobile device
•Diagnostic tools to quickly identify cause of failure
•Remote testing, configuration & faulting
•Modularreplacement (especially on failure)
•Obsolescence (parts, skills, support)
Dependability v4
Good Maintainability
•A highly maintainable signalling system:
•Ideally needs no routine maintenance
•Otherwise, wherever possible, requires routine 
maintenance which aims ideally to be:
•Minimised
•Easy to do, using normal tools and test equipment
•Not very highly skilled
•Non-disruptive (e.g. can be done while trains run)
•Not on or near the track
•Remote (at central staffed point, or via internet from 
anywhere)
•Is quick to repair (easy access, modular, diagnostics)
•Has lifetime access to spares and technical support 
Dependability v4
Safety
Safety  - freedom from unacceptable risk of harm.
This includes:
•System Safety –the ability of the control and 
communications system to protect train movements at 
all times (including the associated design, installation, 
maintenance and operating processes & practices).
•Staff Safety –not exposing people who maintain, 
operate or install control and communications systems 
to danger or harm (including signallers, drivers, 
operating staff as well as maintenance and installation 
technicians)
Dependability v4
Some issues affecting System Safety
•Interlockings –designed, installed and tested to be safe 
in all combinations of circumstances
•Colour light signals –visible in all conditions
•Points –locked, detected & maintained correctly
•Train detection –no false clears with a vehicle present
•Axle counters –assurance of clear track before reset
•Cables –no false feeds or earths
•Indications –failures can mislead operators or deny 
them critical knowledge
•Hardware & Software –designed to fail safe, or (better 
still) to degrade gracefully & safely 
Dependability v4
Maintenance Errors can cause 
Unsafe Conditions 
•The following help to avoid errors
•Easy-to-follow maintenance instructions
•Avoid the need to refer to a large manual
•Encapsulated checklists or prompts on mobile devices are good
•Staff training
•Acquiring the necessary skills
•Avoiding the need for frequent reference to maintenance instructions
•Staff competence testing (at regular intervals?)
•Design to make errors difficult (e.g. pin coding of plug-in modules, 
plug couplers to prevent a wire being connected to the wrong 
circuit)
•Maintainability issues (e.g. ergonomics, weather protection)
All the above are better than the threat of disciplinary action 
after a mistake is made.
Dependability v4
Safety
•A safesignalling system:
•Prevents collisions and derailments
•Conveys clear instructions to drivers 
•Fault tolerant (or degrades gracefully) so manual 
movement authorities or workarounds are avoided
•Fails safe where complete failure is unavoidable
•Has software designed to default to the safest state
•Uses plug-in modules that are colour-coded (good) or 
pin-coded (better) to prevent use of the wrong module
•Does not expose staff to danger (e.g. trains, high 
voltages, hazardous environments)
Dependability v4
Impact on Safety of Reliability & 
Availability
Why will a signalling system with poor reliability or 
availability worsen safety?
Because the signal operator will have to use manual 
procedures more often to allow trains to run.
Being open to human error (and not fully protected 
by the fail-safe design of the signalling system) 
manual procedures are inherently less safe.
Dependability v4
Security and some issues affecting it
Security
oProtection against external actions or events (usually 
confined to malicious ones)
oWill it work without being degraded by changes or 
disruptions?
•Cyber security
•IP enabled systems
•Theft
•Vandalism
•Insider threats
Dependability v4
Good Security
•A highly securesignalling system:
•is immune to all forms of cyber attack
•is resistant or unattractive to theft
•is resistant or unattractive to vandalism
•has protections against malicious actions by insiders
Dependability v4
Examples of how to Improve Dependability
•Technology 
•Axle counters eliminate insulated block joint failures and track 
circuit failures from flooding or rail contamination.
•ETCS  -can eliminate signals and track circuits
•LED signal lamps -longer life and fewer failures
•Redundancy
•Eliminate single points of failure
•Overlap radio coverage
•Duplicate electronic interlockings and lineside modules
•Improve MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures)
•Design and install equipment for high reliability
•Reduce environmental stress (e.g. cooling)
•Improve the preventive maintenance regime
•Introduce remote condition monitoring
Dependability v4
RAMS Tools for improving 
Dependability (1)
FMECA (Failure Modes, Effects, and Criticality Analysis)
A methodology to identify and analyse:
•all potential failure modes of the various parts of a system
•the effects these failures have on the system
•how to avoid the failures and/or mitigate the effects of the 
failure on the system
RCA (Root Cause Analysis)
•A method of problem solving used for identifying the root 
causes of failures and displaying them graphically (e.g. 
Fishbone or Ishikawa diagram)
Dependability v4
RAMS Tools for improving 
Dependability (2)
CCF (Common Cause Failure analysis)
•Identifying all the ways in which a single fault can cause a 
system failure, even where system components are 
duplicated to improve reliability. Statistical analysis then 
allows a meaningful system reliability figure to be calculated.
FTA (Fault Tree Analysis)
•To identify the best ways to reduce the risk of a system failure 
by tracking the various sequences of events that could lead to 
the failure.
DRACAS (Data Reporting And Corrective Action System)
•Tracks all failure related data throughout the period from 
manufacturing to in-service
Dependability v4
RAMS Tools for improving 
Dependability (3)
FRACAS(Fault Reporting, Analysis & Corrective Action System)
•Process for reporting and analysing failures, then planning 
corrective actions. FRACAS records the problems related to an item 
and their associated root causes to assist in identifying corrective 
actions. Fault Control desks would use this. 
RCM (Reliability CentredMaintenance)
•Optimises the frequency and scope of preventive maintenance 
interventions to reduce failures and their impact on railway 
operations.  It takes account of factors such as:
•Typical failure modes
•Probability and consequence of failure
•Safety risk
•Performance risk
•Number of operations
•Operating environment
Dependability v4
Improving ‘Wear-out ’Period 
Reliability
•Optimising Maintenance & Renewals:
•Understanding impact of Failures on Safety & 
Performance (FMECA based)
•Collecting key asset information for reliability analysis
•Determining Asset Life Characteristics (point of onset of 
increasing failure rate)
•Checking current and future availability of spares and 
technical support
•Using all the above to inform the maintenance & 
renewals policy  (i.e. when should we renew?  should we 
change the maintenance regime?)
Dependability v4
Dependability Measurement 
(Operations Phase)
A few examples:
•Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)
•= Length of Time / No. of Failures during that time
•Also MTBSAF for service affecting failures
•Number of Signalling Failures ( or those causing delay, or safety 
risk)
•Mean Time To Repair (MTTR)
•(from time of failure to rectification)
•Downtime costs
•Consider leading indicators  e.g. staff competence, asset 
condition
Dependability v4
Digging Deeper than System 
Failure Rate
•Capturing all relevant data at component level (e.g. 
points, track circuits, radio aerials) gives the best 
opportunity for Dependability improvement
•Fault rate
•Precise cause
•Environment
•Fault history of component (use Computerised 
Maintenance Management System –CMMS)
•Maintenance history of component (CMMS)
•Asset condition
•Data consistency is challenging. Different people will code 
the same failure, or event differently unless the data coding 
structure is simple and foolproof.
Dependability v4
Remote Condition Monitoring
•Predictive Maintenance is the ideal to aim for (i.e. 
detecting a potential fault before it happens –and 
early enough to fix it before the system fails)
•Data should be transmitted to a person who can 
take prompt action
•Examples:
•Points slow to operate
•Error rate on data link
•Signal lamp filament failure
•But not possible for all railway control & 
communications equipment 
Dependability v4
Conclusions
•Dependability is hugely important (impact on whole life 
costs).
•Operations and maintenance (including cost of failures) 
usually exceed the capital cost of a system over its lifetime
•“Does it work?” “Is it safe?” are not enough for a project to 
aim for
•Design for Dependability
•Much cheaper and more effective than retro-fitting
•Don’t let it be value-engineered out of scope
•40 years system lifetime of regret, if you get it wrong!
•Focus on Dependability throughout operational lifetime
•Use measurement and analysis
