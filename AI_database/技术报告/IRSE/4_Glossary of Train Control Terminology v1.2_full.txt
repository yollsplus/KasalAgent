Glossary of Train Control Terminology v1.2
This glossary includes many of the terms that you will encounter in the Certificate (Module A)
Of the IRSE Examination.
Its focus is on commonly used acronyms and on terms Where; in
different countries, there are alternative names in English for the same object, role;
Or
function.
It is not a comprehensive list of all train control terminology.
It does not address
telecommunications terminology because this tends to be more consistent between
countries。
You are not expected to learn the descriptions in the 3rd column。
Just look down the first
column and check xf there are any terms that you are not familiar with。
The term in the first
column is the one that is usually used in the examination.
