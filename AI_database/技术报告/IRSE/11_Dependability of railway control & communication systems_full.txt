Dependability V4

Dependability
Composed of 4 elements (giving the RAMS
acronym):
Reliability
the probability that the item Will deliver its required function
When required。
Availability
the proportion of time for Which the item is in a state to
perform its required function。
Maintainability
the ease With Whichan item is kept in working order or
repaired。
Safety
freedom from unacceptable risk of harm。
Security is sometimes considered separately and cuts across
the 4 elements above.
Dependability V4

Maintenance
Once the system has been designed, installed and tested,
MAINTENANCE is the process that keeps the system
DEPENDABLE.
It can consist of processes such as visual
inspection, adjustment, lubrication, renewal of parts,
testing。
Preventive Maintenance
to keep the item safe and reliable (usually on a pre-
determined schedule).
Predictive Maintenance
preventive maintenance that is only done When the item is
predicted to fail or become unsafe (e.8. from remote condition monitoring data).
Reactive (or Curative, or Corrective) Maintenance (or Repairs)
restoring the item to
working order once it has failed or has a defective
Renewals
Replacing items before they become worn, unreliable or unsafe.
preventive maintenance is usually most valuable on items with moving
parts in a severe environment (e.8. points machines)

part。

Reliability
Reliability
The probability that the item will deliver its required function
When
required。
Delivery of correct functions When in service (Will it work
When it is needed?)
Often measured as Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF).
This formula gives a
good approximation
MTBF
二
Length of Time
Number of Failures in that time
e.吕
At
population level for 120 items, thereare 50 failures in a year。
The
average MTBF for an individual item is 120/50 = 2.4 years。
This Will typically be measured in years for elements of a railway system (e.8。
radio transmitter track circuit), but lower for whole systems。
MTTF (Mean Time To Failure) is a very similar measure used for non-repairable
systems
Dependability V4

Sone
causes of poor Reliability
Poor design (e.8. software
component not resilient)
Maintenance issues not considered at design stage (cost or
time pressure?)
Poor build or installation (e.吕. "nicked" wires, stripped
insulation, inherent weaknesses)
Poor maintenance (e.8. weakness or fault left after last
intervention, deficiency not detected at last routine test or
Visit)
Abusive operation
External (e.8. severe weather, power outage, physical
damage, electromagnetic interference)
Electronics affected
the tough rail environment
Failure to learn from past failures

Examples of root causes of poor
Reliability
Track circuits (with typical symptoms)
Flooded or contaminated ballast (track showing occupied when
clear, or variation in test readings)
Poor insulation oftrack fixings
(track showing occupied when clear)
Failure Of Insulated Rail Joint (IRJ) (track showing occupied when
clear)
Railhead contamination (failing to detect a train)
Points (with typical symptoms)
Unstable track (loss of detection

intermittent or permanent)
Lineside equipment
Electromagnetic interference
Vibbration
Temperature
Humidity
Dependability V4

Examples of Good Reliability
A
highly reliable signalling system:
Will ideally never fail (though may have internal faults or
deliver degraded outputs)
Will self-diagnose internal faults before they cause a
failure of the system (e.8. remote condition monitoring)
Will cope with the real world railway operating
environment (both normaland abnormal)
Few single points of failure
Will cope with possible failures in other systems (e.8。
power supply failures or minor interruptions)
Dependability V4

Availability
Availability
The proportion of time for which the item is in a state to perform its
required function。
Continuity of correct service (For how much of the time is it usable?)
At its
simplest ifcan be expressed as:
Availability
二
Uptime / (Uptime + Downtime)
This is the equivalent of:
Availability
二
MTTF / (MTTF + MTTR)
Where MTTF is Mean Time to Failure (or use MTBF instead)
and MTTR is Mean Time to Repair (from time of failure to rectification).
Planned outages need to be counted as failure incidents
This will typically be nearly 100% for most items of railway equipment; but lower for
Whole systems。
unplanned system availability less than 100% causes loss and
customer dissatisfaction.
Dependability V4
Any

Some effects
On
Availability
Negative
Intrusive preventive maintenance
Taking system out of service (planned)
System out of service because of failure
Restricting train movements to safeguard staff
Positive
Duplication of system components or back-up systems
(can increase availability without component reliability
being increased)
Dependability V4

Examples of Good Availability
A
highlyavailable signalling system:
Will work 24/7 (orall traffic hours)
any maintenance routines do not need the system to be
taken out of service
will continue to deliver at least minimum functionalityin
the events of faults
fault rectification does not need the system to be taken
out ofservice
does not require any work on the lineside
Dependability V4

Maintainability and some issues
affecting it
Maintainability
the ease With Which an item is kept
in
working order or repaired.
Weather protection for maintenance staff
Ergonomics
Easy Or zero maintenance routines
Workflow on mobile device
Diagnostic tools to quickly identify cause of failure
Remote testing, configuration & faulting
Modular replacement (especially on failure)
Obsolescence (parts, skills, support)
Dependability V4

Good Maintainability
A
highly maintainable signalling system:
Ideally needs no routine maintenance
Otherwise, wherever possible; requires routine
maintenance Which aims ideally to be:
Minimised
Easy to
using normal tools and test equipment
Not very highly skilled
Non-disruptive (e.8. can be done While trains run)
Not on or near the track
Remote (at central staffed point, or via internet from
anywhere)
Is
to repair (easy access, modular, diagnostics)
Has lifetime access to spares and technical support

Safety
Safety
freedom from unacceptable risk ofharm.
This includes:
System Safety
一
the ability of the control and
communications system to protect train movements at
all times (including the associated design, installation,
maintenance and operating processes & practices).
Staff Safety
not exposing people who maintain,
operate or install control and communications systems
to danger or harm (including signallers, drivers,
operating staff as wellas maintenance and installation
technicians)
Dependability V4

Some issues affecting System Safety
Interlockings
designed,installed and tested to be safe
inall combinations f circumstances
Colour light signals
Visibble in all conditions
Points
locked, detected & maintained correctly
Train detection
no false clears With a vehicle present
Axle counters
assurance of clear track before reset
Cables
no false feeds or earths
Indications
failures can mislead operators or deny
them critical knowledge
Hardware & Software
designed to fail safe, or (better
still) to degrade gracefully & safely
Dependability V4

Maintenance Errors can
CaUSe
Unsafe Conditions
The following help to avoid errors
Easy-to-follow maintenance instructions
Avoid the need to refer to a large manual
Encapsulated checklists or prompts on mobile devices are good
Staff training
Acquiring the necessary skills
Avoiding the need for frequent reference to maintenance instructions
Staff competence testing (at regular intervals?)
Design to make errors difficult (e.8: pin coding of
Iluemodules,
plug couplers to prevent a wire being connected to
wrong
circuit)
Maintainability issues (e.8. ergonomics, weather protection)
Allthe above are better than the threat of disciplinary action
after a mistake is made.
Dependability V4

Safety
A
Safe signalling system:
Prevents collisions and derailments
Conveys clear instructions to drivers
Fault tolerant (or degrades gracefully) so manual
movement authorities or workarounds are avoided
Fails safe Where complete failure is unavoidable
Has software designed to default to the safest state
Uses plug-in modules that are colour-coded (good) or
pin-coded (better) to prevent use of the Wrong module
Does not expose staff to danger (e.8. trains, high
voltages, hazardous environments)
Dependability V4

Impact on Safety of Reliability &
Availability
Why will a signalling system With poor reliability Or
availability worsen safety?
Because the signal operator will have to
USe manual
procedures more often to allow trains to run。
Being open to human error (and not fully protected
by the fail-safe design of the signalling system)
manual procedures are inherently less safe。
Dependability V4

Securityand some issues affecting it
Security
Protection against external actions or events (usually
confined to malicious ones)
Will it work without being degraded by changes or
disruptions?
Cyber security
IP enabled systems
Theft
Vandalism
Insider threats
Dependability V4

Good Security
A
highly secure signalling system:
is immune to all forms of cyber attack
is resistant or unattractive to theft
is resistant or unattractive to Vandalism
has protections against malicious actions by insiders
Dependability V4

Examples of how to Improve Dependability
Technology
Axle counters eliminate insulated block joint failures and track
circuit failures from flooding or rail contamination。
ETCS
can eliminate signals and track circuits
LED signal lamps - longer life and fewer failures
Redundancy
Eliminate single points of failure
Overlap radio coverage
Duplicate electronic interlockings and lineside modules
Improve MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures)
Design and install equipment for high reliability
Reduce environmental stress (e.8. cooling)
Improve the preventive maintenance regime
Introduce remote condition monitoring
Dependability V4

RAMS Tools forimproving
Dependability (1)
FMECA (Failure Modes, Effects, and Criticality Analysis)
4
methodology to identify and analyse:
all potential failure modes of the various parts of a system
the effects these failures have on the system
how to avoid the failures and/or mitigate the effects of the
failure on the system
RCA (Root Cause Analysis)
4
method of problem solving used for identifying the root
causes offailures and displaying them graphically (e.8
Fishbone or Ishikawa diagram)
Dependability V4

RAMS Tools forimproving
Dependability (2)
CCF (Common Cause Failure analysis)
Identifying all the ways in Which a single fault can cause
9
system failure, even where system components are
duplicated to improve reliability: Statistical analysis then
alloWS a
meaningful system reliability figure to be calculated。
FTA (Fault Tree Analysis)
To identify the best ways to reduce the risk of a system failure
by tracking the various sequences of events that could lead to
the failure.
DRACAS (Data Reporting And Corrective Action System)
Tracks all failure related data throughout the period from
manufacturing to in-service
Dependability V4

RAMS Tools forimproving
Dependability (3)
FRACAS (Fault Reporting, Analysis & Corrective Action System)
Process for reporting and analysing failures。
then planning
corrective actions. FRACAS records the problems related %o an item
and their associated root causes to assist in identifying corrective
actions. Fault Control desks Would use this。
RCM (Reliability Centred Maintenance)
Optimises the frequency and scope Of preventive maintenance
interventions to reduce failures and their impact on railway
operations。
It takes account of factors suchas:
Typical failure modes
Probability and consequence of failure
Safety risk
Performance risk
Number of operations
Operating environment
Dependability V4

Improving
Wear-out' Period
Reliability
Optimising Maintenance & Renewals:
Understanding impact of Failures on Safety &
Performance (FMECA based)
Collecting key asset information for reliability analysis
Determining Asset Life Characteristics (point of onset of
increasing failure rate)
Checking current and future availability of spares and
technical support
Using all the above to inform the maintenance &
renewals policy
(i.e. When should we renew? should we
change the maintenance regime?)
Dependability V4

Dependability Measurement
(Operations Phase)
A few
examples:
Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)
Length of Time
No.Of Failures during that time
Also MTBSAF for service affecting failures
Number of Signalling Failures (or those causing delay, or safety
risk)
Mean Time To Repair (MTTR)
(from time of failure to rectification)
Downtime CoSts
Consider leading indicators
e.8. Staff competence, asset
condition
Dependability V4

Digging Deeper than System
Failure Rate
Capturing all relevant data at component level (e.吕:
points, track circuits, radioaerials) gives the best
opportunity for Dependability improvement
Fault rate
Precise caUse
Environment
Fault history of component (use Computerised
Maintenance Management System
CMMS)
Maintenance history of component (CMMS)
Asset condition
Data consistency is challenging: Different people Will code
the same failure; or event gifferently unless the data coding
structure is simple and foolproof。
Dependability V4

Remote Condition Monitoring
Predictive Maintenance is the ideal to aim for (i.e.
detecting a potential fault before it happens
and
early enough to fix it before the system fails)
Data should be transmitted to a person Who can
take prompt action
Examples:
Points slow to operate
Error rate on data link
Signal lamp filament failure
But not possible forall railway control &
communications equipment
Dependability V4

Conclusions
Dependability is hugely important (impact on Whole life
costs).
Operations and maintenance (including cost of failures)
usually exceed the capital cost of a system overits lifetime
Does it Work?"
Is it safe?" are not enough for a project to
aim for
Design for Dependability
Much cheaperand more effective than retro-fitting
Don't let it be value-engineered out of scope
40 years system lifetime of regret, ifyou
i Wrong!
Focus on Dependability throughout operational lifetime
Use measurement and analysis
