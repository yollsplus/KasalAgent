INTRODUCTION
This document introduces the Deliverable 13.1 Which consists of three parts corresponding to tasks
within the Work package
Those parts are shortly described below。
2.1
TASK 13.1: SYSTEM DEFINITION
The objective of this Task (13.1) is to define the signalling system, called Moving Block System, in
particular the system objectives, capabilities, boundaries, functions, operational requirements and
assumptions in order to cooperate with the Moving Block concept and constitutes the first part of the
Deliverable 13.1.
2.2
TASK 13.2: MOVING BLOCK SPECIFICATION

REQUIREMENTS, ENGINEERING,
AND OPERATIONAL RULES
Based on the System Definition the purpose of this task is to analyse the impact of the System Pillar
on System Requirements and to develop a Moving Block Specification。
The work on the Moving
Block Specification is organized in an iterative and incremental fashion in five releases. The first
three releases are planned for WP13 and releases 4 and 5 are planned for WP14. The contents of
each release are defined in collaboration with the stakeholders (e.9. prototype developers and the
demonstrators WP). Each release leads to an intermediate and reviewed version of the Moving Block
Specification。
2.3
TASK 13.3: MoVING BLOCK SAFETY ANALYSIS
The subject of this task was the safety analysis for the "Moving Block System" (MBS) that has been
specified in Tasks 13.1and 13.2.
To move a step beyond What Was previously done in S2R (e.9.,
in-depth analysis of relevant operational scenarios) a
novel
method
called System
Theoretic
Process Analysis (STPA) -
WaS
applied to the matter. This STPA focuses on
unsafe control actions"
in control and feedback loops within complex systems. An advantage over previous methods is the
potential to identify emergent risks stemming from the interaction between those (sub)systems;
which are often overlooked.

WORK PACKAGE GLOSSARY
Note: Some of those terms are currently also defined in the Glossary of other documents (e.9.,
System Specification, Safety Analysis) of 013.1. Therefore, as long as there is no separate Glossary
document available,
care must be taken to keep the definitions synchronised。
Term
Definition
Area of Control
The
Area
of
Control
is
the   topologically
limited
extent
and
the
infrastructural Trackside Assets in this geographical extent The term is
used here for defining the technical and operational responsibility of one
MBS.
Domain Data
The Domain Data refers to USe case
specific configuration aata for the
MBS to define the specific application。
These can be broadly classified
as Map Data, Segment Profiles,
and
Parameter Data。
As
3
part of
configuration process, the MBS needs Domain Data
Potential updates
of Domain Data will be realised by a centralised provisioning process incl。
synchronous activation of the new data version.
Operational Plan
The Operational Plan is the result of the planning process performed by
the planning system (TMS). It describes either a planned Operational
Movement, Operational Restriction or Operational Warning Measure
through a temporal sequence of Operational Events to be implemented
by underlying subsystems in the Area of Control。
Operational State
The Operational State consists oftrain-related information (e.9.,
permissions, authorisations or train position) and track-related
information (e.9., state of Trackside Assets).
System Capability
ASystem Capabilityis a service an actor requires from the System tofunfil
its business goals. System capabilities are realised by exploiting one or
multiple functions, usually in a chain of functions. System capabilities in
terms Of this document are Very similar to
USe
cases and the theory
behind i。
Train-centric
4
train-centric approach from a trackside point of view focuses on the
train as thetrue business object.
Atrain object is derived by a train-centric
signalling system using the currently available sensor information from
the train and the trackside. This allows the safety logic of train-centric
signalling system to operate on the train objects instead on the auxiliary
information  'occupancy'

of vehicles through the railway network. to provide a safe route through
the railway network。

SYSTEM OBJECTIVE
2.1
DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEM UNDER CONSIDERATION
The Moving Block System (MBS) is based on a
train-centric approach using Full Moving block
principles with the overall objective to engineer high capacity, low cost, high reliability signalling
Systems. The MBS is defined as a single system, Without enforcing the conventional separation of
Radio Block Centre (RBC) and interlocking (IXL). The MBS is based on ETCS cab signalling without
lineside signals. It uses a more generic and simplified safety logic by abandoning the traditional block
concept mainly relying on signals。
By emphasising the safety logic, the dependency on country
specific operational processes is reduced.
The
Moving Block System builds on the Functional Railway System Architecture defined by the
System Pillar and the Moving Block specification defined in Shift2Rail [4] and RCA initiative [3].
Depending on the requirements and needs, the MBS can operate within an environment where TTD
equipment is installed but also within an environment where TTD equipment is not installed. The
rationale for considering TTD is to support migration, recovery from degraded situations, and to
facilitate sensor fusion principles to foster different localisation inputs.
2.1.1
System capabilities
The fundamental objectives of the MBS are to ensure safe train movement and prevent railway
accidents.
can be split into the following system capabilities:
MBS manages communication sessions With Trackside Assets (TA) via specified interfaces
within its Area of Control (AoC).
MBS manages communication sessions with trains via specified interfaces Within its AoC and
adjacentareas Where trains are supposed to establish orterminate a communication session。
MBS controls all TAs within its AoC
MBS manages
the
current trackside state
and
determines
the state
Of the track from
information given during runtime by trains and TAs within its AoC.
MBS manages all track path allocations for all trains and vehicles Within its AoC. This contains
an adequate and risk-based protection of requested pieces of track for an intentional train
movement。
MBS issues authorisations for train movements based on requested and accepted track path
allocations。
MBS supervises trains and TAs to prevent railway accidents。
This includes especially any
collision, derailment or over-speeding.
MBS stores an up-to-date, reliable and consistent current Operational State and provides
this Operational State to systems connected to MBS.
MBS manages Domain Data changes e.9. , by introducing new parts of the track。

MBS manages Usage Restriction
Areas (URA) and
ensures that any URA limitations or
constraints are considered for operation
MBS handles a safe transition of train movement from and to adjacent systems。
The system is providing Moving Block operation but it needs to be understood that its application is
more
generic. As it authorises a
movement to an arbitrary (operationally sensible) location Which
might or might not be the rear end of the preceding train,
i is in its core
moving block agnostic, as
the on-board unit is.
Thus, the MBS is capable of supporting fixed block, virtual fixed block and
moving block operation. It depends on the requesting Plan Execution (PE) system which operation
is actually performed。
2.2
LONG TERM OPERATING STRATEGY AND CONDITIONS
MBS shall offer increased operational flexibility (e.9., by enabling train movements from anywhere
to anywhere; not using pre-defined paths ) allowing for both the minimisation of manual operation by
the dispatcherloperator and enabling faster recovery from degraded and emergency situations。
The long-term operating strategy of the MBS in combination with the interfacing systems revolves
around a high grade of operational automation. In the case of deviations from normal operation, the
higher level of automation facilitates the choice of flexible; operational alternatives as well as the
reduction Of risks associated with human errors by providing improved technical assistance (e.9., for
construction workers, maintenance staff, operators).
Allin all, MBS should contribute to the increase in capacity by utilising shorter headways enabled by
the more efficient use of the infrastructure, the use of information of the running trains and the more
precise occupancy information through the combination of information sources (e.9., axle counters;
track circuits, Train Position Reports).
2.3
SYSTEM LIFE-TIME CONSIDERATIONS
System life-time is understood as system life-cycle within this system definition. MBS is foreseen
with a modular functional approach. Regarding this approach several life-cycle considerations have
to be considered:
MBS life-cycle is independent from life-cycles of surrounding systems。
changes in PE, Digital
Register (DR) or Trackside Asset Control and Supervision (TACS) do not affect MBS as
35
interfaces used are unchanged. Due to generic safety logic, MBS life-cycle is independent from life-
of Domain Data provided by DR.Changes in infrastructure and TAs only affects the Domain
Data of the MBS without change the software of the MBS. MBS requirements lifecycle is envisioned
independent from hardware components and their operating systems。
The only dependency is given by the MBS functional lifecycle itself。
2.4
LOGISTIC CONSIDERATIONS
The
MBS
as described Within this
System definition is not a physical product. At this stage of
development, logistic considerations are not necessary.

SYSTEM BOUNDARIES
This section defines the environment and boundaries of the Moving Block System (MBS) by defining
the interfaces and interactions With other technological systems, the environment, humans and other
railway duty holders。
As there is
no target CCS reference
architecture
available yet, this chapter is based
on
the
assumptions consolidated in WP13.
It is expected that the interfaces or details of the interface is
subject to change based on the evolvement of the target CCS reference architecture。

INTERFACES AND INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER TECHNOLOGICAL SYSTEM
This chapter defines the interfaces and interactions between the MBS and other technological
systems. For each technological system a description, the cardinality (from one MBS instance) and
the applicable standard (讦 any) to be used for the corresponding interface is provided。

radio-based ETCS related neighbouring system can be either another MBS ora
neighbouring Radio Block Centre (RBC) and an IXL. The interface to such a
Description
neighbouring system allows trains to pass the border tolfrom a neighbouring Level
2 area Without changing the driver responsibility and the cab-signalling
A
neighbouring system not related to radio based ETCS is an IXL. The interface to
such a neighbouring
System allows trains to pass the border tolfrom an area not
equipped with Level 2.
The cab-signalling is replaced by optical signals。
Cardinality
几
The interface to a radio-based ETCS related neighbouring system is based
te
existing ETCS specifications [1], namely Subset-039 and Subset-0g8。
For the interface to a neighbouring IXL system it is recommended, but not
mandatory, to use the SCI-ILS interface as published in EULYNX [2].
Interface
Notes:
Interfaces to neighbouring IXL systems depend on the supported interface
capabilities of the IXL and have to be adapted, e.9., by using adapter
solutions.
An interface to an adjacent MBS may also require enhancements to the
existing ETCS specifications.

INTERFACES AND INTERACTIONS WITH PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT
The MBS as described within this system definition is not a physical product. Therefore, at this stage
Of development, no interfaces and interactions with physical environment are necessary.
The MBShas to be used in a common railways' environment and therefore the system environmental
conditions for railways applications as defined by EN50125 and EN50121 have to be considered
Whereas:

radiation, lightning and pollution and
the standard EN50121
describes the characteristics of the railway system Which affect
electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) behaviour。
3.3
INTERFACES AND INTERACTIONS WITH HUMANS
The MBS as described within this system definition is not a physical product. Therefore, at this stage
Of development, no interfaces and interactions with humans are necessary and foreseen。
When using the MBSin a common railways'
environment in future, an interface to a Maintenance
Staff via Diagnostic System may be necessary。
Fortest purposes additional interactions with humans may be necessary as required by testing staff,
e.9., test interfaces, additional data capture needs, etc.
3.4
INTERFACES AND INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER RAILWAY DUTY HOLDERS
The MBS as described within this system definition is not a physical product. Therefore; at this stage
Of development; no interfaces and interactions With other railway duty holders are necessary and
foreseen. If there are requirements of other duty holders (e.9., railway undertakings), they will be
fulfilled using the existing interfaces to the actors as described above。
When using the MBSin a common railways' environment in future, an interface to other railway duty
holders may be necessary. This needs to be covered in specific projects。

SCOPE OF OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS INFLUENCING THE
SYSTEM
5.1
CONSTRAINTS IMPOSED BY EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE
The existing infrastructure today has the following characteristics that can impose constraints to the
System:
Wide range of application of baselines and system versions
Different application of L1 , L1 with infill, L1 with loops, L2 with light signals, L2 only, etc。
Highly specialised to fit to "traditional" country-specific rules
Implement national laws that are sometimes indirectly related to rail traffic;
e.9., Iaws for
public roads that affect the Use of level crossings
In conclusion, to avoid Moving Block System (MBS) dialects (e.9., in ETCS today), operational
harmonisation is necessary。
This Would drastically minimise the need for adjustments to MBSon a
national level。
Nevertheless, considering that the MBS will be integrated into existing railway infrastructure; MBS
shall be able to receive necessary information from these legacy systems to be able to ensure safe
movements inside its Area of Control (AoC).
A major interface that needs to be established is the
interfaces for adjacent interlockings and RBCs to ensure a safe handover. The integration of legacy
Traffic Management Systems (TMS), control systems and object controllers have to be analysed as
well for migration purposes。
Therefore; requirements have to be identified and exported to these
Systems so that adapter solutions can be developed to connect them to MBS. MBS itself shall ideally
only communicate to another MBS and the systems specified in the target Traffic CS architecture
defined by the System Pillar. Legacy systems have to be adapted in order to communicate with MBS.
Note: The interface for handover to and from a legacy system (see also chapter 3.1.1) is out of scope
for R2DATO Phase
1and will thus be excluded in the following subchapters:
The scope of R2DATO
Phase 2 is not yet specified。
5.2
SYSTEM OPERATING CONDITIONS AND CONSTRAINTS
The following operating constrains apply to MBS:
Operation With national ATP is not possible
No light signalling is supported (with the potential exception of transition areas)
There are several operating conditions that apply to MBS:
MBS supports ETCS Level 2。
Flexible migration of fleets concerning the ETCS equipment
have to be considered, e.9. , handling of different ETCS versions, functions and non-equipped
trains.
Trains that deliver their train integrity and safe train length information to MBS as well as
trains that do not send this information have to be supported.
The aim is a minimum or no manual interaction between driver and signaller。

Suropes Rail
AIlI movements inside the AoC of MBS are supervised . Furthermore; the logical handling of
all movements is the same, meaning that there is no distinction between shunting routes and
train routes
anymore.
The setting
and protection of any kind of trainlvehicle
movement
(scheduled or not) is executed with the same set of functions that only change parameters
according to the intended movement on the track. However, this does not mean, that the
operational process of shunting (e.9., in the mode SH or SM) will not be necessary or is
planned to be eliminated. Only the technical implementation in MBS is referred to in this
operational condition.
MBSis applicable for different types of railways lines (regional, low density, urban, main line,
high speed):
The loading and activation of Domain Data to MBS is possible during MBS' runtime. Thus,
MBS shall be independent from Domain Data update and change lifecycles。
5.3
SYSTEM MAINTENANCE CONDITIONS
The maintenance strategy provides the use of IT deployment strategies like continuous integration
based on reliable automatic configuration and test procedures。
This enables a faster adaptation of
the infrastructure to operational needs than today. This includes the update of infrastructure data;
e.9.
topology data update without restarting MBS, as
as other configuration data. MBS should
support the development of easily maintainable solutions e.9., With a feasible degree Of modularity,
thus reducing the maintenance effort for the staff e.9., changing the configuration of the system,
installing updates, etc。
Note: The physical aspects of maintenance
are
out of scope for now; thus e.9.,
changing of
hardware; cabling etc. is not considered.
Regarding the interface with actor Maintenance Staff, the necessity of an HMI has to be analysed
further during system specification. This interface Will exclude some maintenance functionalities like
the activation of Domain Data as this is coordinated by the interfacing system Digital Register。
5.4
LOGISTIC SUPPORT CONSIDERATIONS
Physical architecture of the system is out Of scope. Thus, no considerations about logistic support。
5.5
REVIEWOF PAST EXPERIENCE DATA FOR SIMILAR SYSTEMS
The general experience with a substantial subset of today's interlockings (IXL) is that there is no
standardised interface to i Which causes
a lot Of project engineering and development effort in
interfacing systems. Oftentimes, the interfacing systems, like for example the control system, needs
detailed knowledge about the behaviour of the IXL to properly command it. Every change of the IXL's
baseline
leads
to changes
of
all
interfacing systems
35
have
to support newlchanged
functionalities. High coordination effort to align the rollout and migration of all the affected railway
systems, e.9., control system, Radio Block Centre (RBC); TMS and track worker safety systems, is
needed.
This is not only costly and prone to compatibility issues,
but also significantly prolongs
project durations。
A
more specific example is the operation with ETCS. Due to the fact that the OPE TSI has a lot of
non-harmonised rules, major differences remain in the implementation of the same operational
processes in different countries. This is due to the freedom of choice and application of the trackside

(e.9., Whether or not to "stop if in SR" balise; Whether or not to apply packet 88,
Whether or not to
apply reference balises, the start of mission procedure used). Additionally, differences arise from the
use Of different class B systems. But even if the application of the TSI is chosen (i.e.
ETCS), there
appear to
be differences in the implementation and rules of operational processes。 Also; this
'loophole" to use NTCISTM when implementing ETCS ultimately delays the rollout and operation
with ETCS.An example for this can be seen in the complex integration projects, e.9., for Abellio with
3 national ATPs and ETCS integrated on-board.
The integration of ETCS also depends on the used interlocking. For example; when entering an
occupied track. Today, this is sometimes done in mode OS, sometimes done in SRor even in SH。
In most cases; the difference is due to differences in the functionality of the interlocking Which is
used. Also, With relatively modern interlockings, Which can support OS, SRor SH is implemented
nonetheless。
Note: EULYNX [2] is excluded from consideratjon here because there are no implementations of
this standard yet in operation。
5.6
INFLUENCE ON OPERATIONAL AND MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL, PASSENGERS
AND PUBLIC
There is no influence on passengers and public expected besides safety by design。
As the
neW
system
MBS
needs
to
be
maintained throughout its lifecycle;
neW
maintenance
procedures and protocols are to be expected . From a hardware perspective, MBS components shall
be able to run ona new safe computing
platform (standardised by the System Pillar) The deployment
on existing legacy hardware through e.9. =
emulation, can be analysed in a later specification level。
The MBS is expected to influence the operational procedures and conditions at least regarding the
available automated assistance for operational personnel,
new procedures for Level 2 operation in
compliance with the ETCS Specifications [1] and for entering an occupied track. Therefore; i has to
be specified how MBS is supporting and managing operation and what is needed on the operational
Side of things. The operational procedures to handle MBS shall not include business "logic" but be
based on necessary issues, not on national particularitieslsensitivities。
Note: The definition of the exact operational procedures is out of scope; because this is Within the
scope of operational harmonisation in the System Pillar。
In order to use the MBS, training as Well as operating manuals have to be provided to the railway
staff。
5.7
DESCRIPTION OF OPERATING PROCEDURES
The operation of MBS requires operating procedures as Well as maintenance procedures. Similar to
EULYNX, there is an "operating mode'
and "maintenance mode'
of the system envisioned. If the
System enters "maintenance mode'
procedures for system installation loading of new software data
and configurations can proceed. The maintenance mode as well the start of the procedures can be
activated either manually by e.9., actor Maintenance Staff, or automatically by an external actor e.9.,
Plan Execution (PE) for planned maintenance. The transition to the "operating mode" of the system
is only possible after a successful system test activating the changes made to the system during
maintenance.
Either MBS does the system test autonomously orland in interaction With local staff

that ensures that no one is endangered by the system activation e.9., by checking and confirming
that no obstacles are in the area affected by the system
5.8
MODES OF OPERATION
Modes of operation in the following three major categories according to the TSI OPE [5] are covered
by the system:
Normal operation
Degraded operation
Handling of emergency situations
Several use cases that are part of the listed modes of operation have to be handled by the MBS.
Firstly, the downgrade from normal situations to degraded situations have to be covered by MBS.
For this consideration, degraded situations can be defined as "the system With limited functionality"_
Then, the recovery procedure to normal operation needs to be handled by MBS,
with or without
interaction with interfacing systems。
Furthermore; the recovery from emergency situations to operation in degraded situations has to be
handled by
MBS.
For example;
the loss of train integrity monitoring on-board might trigger an
emergency reaction first。
After the train integrity is assessed once more; the train can continue in
degraded situations With localisation by Trackside Train Detection (TTD)
As a general principle; the handling of degraded situation shall be automated as much as possible。
This means that the operator shall intervene when a degraded situation can't be handled by rules
(interplay between PE and MBS). In order to ensure safety, the human ability to judge and assess a
situation is needed either by technical means or through legal obligation.

ASSUMPTIONS AND EXISTING SAFETY MEASURES
6.1
ASSUMPTIONS
This chapter contains assumptions related to external systems or actors interacting with the Moving
Block System (MBS) or related to input from external systems that are not covered somewhere else
(e.9.
in the corresponding standard)。
Identifier
Allocation
Assumption
61
General
Virtual Coupling is out of scope。
Justification: Virtual Coupling is not part of the Grant Agreement of
WP13.
T1
Train
Ifa train is equipped with a TIMS and this trains confirms its train
integrity, then the MBS can trust the train for:
Train Length
Received in Validated Train Data as
TRAIN,
Which is the maximum length of the train in rear of
the engine, counted from the front end of the engine
considering the active cab, and considering the coupling play
andlor any other uncertainties in the length information.
Train Position Reports
including Q_LENGTH,
匕 TRAININT
This is consistent With the approach in the ETCS Specifications [1]:
On-Board can only confirm Train Integrity to Trackside if the
train length can be treated as SIL4。
Justification: This means that the train length and information from
the train position reports (e.9., train integrity information) can be
used by the MBS to release track behind the train, and for length
calculations during splitting and joining.
Note: This implies that the MBS won't trust the train for the Train
Length 讦f the train has never confirmed its train integrity (e.9.
because the train is not equipped with a TIMS)
T2
Train
In case of joining or splitting of trains, this causes the external Train
Integrity Monitoring System (TIMS) devices (in each train) to report
loss of train integrity。
As long as MBS has not acknowledged the new train data (incl. train
length), the train integrity is not confirmed again by the train(s)
Justification: The safe train length is not valid anymore When trains
physically join or split。

GLOSSARY
Note: Some of those terms are currently also defined in the Glossary of other documents (e.9.,
System Definition, Safety Analysis) of WP13. Therefore; as long as there is no separate Glossary
document available; care must be taken to keep the definitions synchronised.
Term
Definition
Allocation Section
Allocation Sections express gauge clearance conflicts between different
tracks。
Forexample;
Allocation Sections are associated to the representation of
Switchable
Track
Assets
and further track connections
like diamond
crossings。
The
Allocation
Sections
are
used in terms of granting
3
Movement
Permission request as condition for clearance in a certain area。

Area of Control (AoC)
The Area of Control is the topologically limited extent used
here for
defining the technical and operational responsibility of one instance of
MBS.
Domain Data
The Domain Data refers to use case specific configuration data for the
MBS to define the specific application。
These can be broadly classified
as Map Data, Segment Profiles;
and
Parameter Data。
As
3
part of
configuration process, the MBS needs Domain Data。
Potential updates
of Domain Data will be realised by a centralised provisioning process incl。
synchronous activation of the new data version.

Domain Object
Domain Object is an abstract object for Which a Domain (e.9. Moving
Block System) has the main responsibility. There might be other Domains
Who are consumers of this object as Well. In general, i is based on or
linked to the Domain Data.
Drive Protection
Drive Protection Section is a linear contiguous stretch of track with a
Section (DPS)
driveability (passage possible yeslno) state.
Drive Protection Section (DPS) represents a
Track Edge Section that
can be brought to different driveability states to ensure the driveability or
safety ofa track route. As such, it is an abstraction for any location on the
railway
network
that
may adopt different
states
due
to
Switchable
Trackside Asset (e.9. points or level crossings):

MBS Operational
MBS
Operational
State
is
the
collection
Of
all
Of
Domain Objects
State
instantiated by the MBS to manage its operations and supervise the train
movements。
This includes:
Train Objects;
Unresolved Trackbound Objects;
Trackside Asset Objects,
Movement Permission,
Etc.
MBSis operational
MBSis operational when it is in a State allowing the MBS to perform its
fundamental  function
ensuring safe
train
movement and preventing
railway accidents, incidents。
From now on, communication sessions to
the
external systems (e.9,
OBU,
PE; etc.) can
be established
and
supervised。
Movement Permission
The Movement Permission defines the part of the track that is reserved
for the movement of a train.
It includes:
Movement Permission Extent
Risk Buffer
Risk Path
Requested Maximum Speed
ETCS Movement Mode
List of DPS Groups that must not be used as flank protection measure
Movement Permission
A Movement Permission Extent is a linear contiguous stretch of track that
Extent
is reserved for the movement of a train。
The Movement Permission is
translated to an authorisation (e.9. Movement Authority) according to the
IETCSI
SUBSET-026 that is transmitted to the train.
The Movement Permission Extent is
of the Movement Permission.
Source: RCA
Non-switchable
Non-switchable Trackside Asset is a Trackside Asset which provides
Trackside Asset
information to the MBS (e.9.
Trackside Train Detection) but cannot be
controlled to a particular state。
Position is ambiguous
The position information contained in a Train Position Report (Position
Report or SoM Position Report with status Valid) can be considered as
ambiguous in case MBS is not able to safely locate the train within the
track layout. Since the Train Position Report only contains a (directed)
distance to the LRBG,
MBS might not be able to locate the train on the
correct position in the track layout, e.9. in case of a Zig-zag movement

Risk Buffer
The Risk Bufferis a linear contiguous stretch of track that serves as the
oVerrun
protection and in the event of a rollback of a chased train。
It is
part of a Movement Permission。
Risk Buffer exists 讦 there is a Danger Point or a safe margin (project
specific) greater than Zero

Which a non-permitted vehicle movement could result in a flank collision
with a Vehicle
moving
the Movement Permission Extent.
Movement Permission can contain zero or more Risk Paths。
Source: RCA
Switchable Trackside
A
Switchable Trackside Asset is a
Trackside Asset Which enables (e.9.
Asset
points, derailers, movable bridges, gates) or allows (e.9. light signals at
border, level crossings) the continuation of movement beyond this asset
when this latter is controlled to particular state。
Topology Data
See entry for Domain Data
Track Edge (TE)
Track Edge is
3
linear object that defines an uninterrupted stretch of a
railway track without divergence or convergence. A Track Edge is defined
along the centre line of the 20 or 30 track alignment and has a finite
length。
The Track Edges have an implicit direction (from start to end).
The startlend of Track Edge shall correspond to the location of a simple
point, or any form of end of track。
Source: RCA, ISDIDMI
Track Edge Point
Track Edge Point is a spot location on a Track Edge。
(TEP)
Example usage: balise location

Train Location
Train Location is the MBS interpretation of the unambiguous location of
thetrain, based on Train Position Reports, Validated Train Data and other
inputs if available, e.9. TTD. Train Location is a linear contiguous stretch
of track that has a front and a rear。

Train Object
Train Object is the object needed by the MBS to manage the connected
trains currently performing their mission。
Note: This Train Object could nevertheless correspond to a train not (yet)
localised by MBS。
If a Train Object is referenced as a geometric extent, the extent is the
extent of the Train Location.

Only the ETCS modes SB, FS, OS are covered inside the AoC.
Transitions (fromlto adjacent interlockings, RBC, and MBS) are out of scope。
2.1
GENERAL LIMITATIONS
This chapter contains general limitations that are Valid for all releases of the System Specification。
Disclaimer: this specification is not yet part of a complete safety analysis。
As the System Specification also contains the functionality of an RBC, the MBS shall be able
to perform all the functions of the RBC Basic Interoperability Constituent (IC).
Instead of
repeating the /ETCS/, this document focuses on the essential functions of the MBS rather
than specifying each function in detail of the RBC functionality.
This System Specification does not explicitly specify the rules to provide national values;
position report parameters and MA request parameters to the OBU. This depends on e.9.
the operational rules and therefore is assumed to be
application specific。
This System Specification focus on functional requirements
The swinging overlaps are currently not supported (see REQ-SC_DPS_RB).
The System Version 2.1 of /ETCS/is only supported by the MBS。
Justification: This System Specification is used by the demonstrators using OBUs。
But there are no OBUs available yet supporting a newer System Version than 2.1.In
later editions of the System Specification newer System Versions will be supported。
This System Specification does not explicitly specify how the cryptographic artefacts (e.9.
KMACS) for the communication between MBS and the trains are made known to the MBS.
Justification: According to chapter 2 this interface is out of scope of this System Specification。

APPROACH AND METHODOLOGY
The Moving Block System specification is developed according to the following inputs sources:
Moving Block System Definition (ref. /SysDefl; Which
defines the System capabilities to be performed。
defines the external actors and the interfaces (System Boundaries).
The EULYNX Standard (ref. /EULYNXI)
It is used for the interface with the Trackside Asset
TACS interface; see chapter 7.1)
The CCS TSI (ref.ICCSTSII;
for the ETCS concepts and functionality
for the interface with OBU (IOBU interface; see chapter 7.3)
for the interface with adjacent system (1 
AS interface, see chapter in a later release)
forthe interface with Security Service (I_SEC interface, see chapter in a later release)

the
Work bases
on the
operational scenarios to
be
covered by the Moving Block Demonstrator (WP44).
The goal of the System Specification is the derivation of the System Requirements from the System
Capabilities。
The approach to derive the System Requirements for the MBS is as follows:

5.1.1
Communication patterns
MBS has communication sessions to its actors according to the following list. For every actor it is
described why there is the initiatorlresponder role:
(MBS as session initiator)
DR: DRis a service Which provides topology data to its clients. It therefore acts in a server
role Which means that clients (like MBS) establish the communication to the server。
TACS:
Defined
by EULYNX; the interlocking (here:
MBS) is responsible to initiate the
communication。
(MBS as session initiation responder)
PE: MBSis a service to PE which serves requests to set Switchable Trackside Assets and
grant Movement Permissions.
MBS therefore acts in a
server role Which means that PE
establishes the communication to the server (MBS):
OBU: It initiates the communication as MBS won't know all trains in its area until they connect
(IETCSI
SUBSET-O26 83.5.3.4 of /ETCSI.
MBS also supervises the communication
SO i can react to a loss of communication.
If MBS is the session initiator, it means whenever a supervision function of MBS detects that there
is no communication, it establishes a communication (which might be the Very first establishment at
start of MBSor a re-establishment after a communication loss):

Comments
Before release 5, there are the following restrictions
The scope of Topology Data is the full Area af Control (so
no
partial
update)
Topology Data are loaded only once at startup and remain unchanged (so
no update during run-time)
Itis assumed that neither connecting to DR, nor loading the Topology Data
from there fails (exclusion of unhappy paths)
The scenario will thus widen in
a later release: data
are
not only loaded and
immediately activated, but pre-loaded, approved, and activated.In order to save
work already knowing the future state, the function to load Topology Data is
already named 'preload' and not only 'load' . The term 'preloaded' can be read as
'loaded'.

SYSC: CONTROL SWITCHABLE TRACKSIDE ASSETS
Table 4
Description of SysC: Control Switchable Trackside Assets
Description
This capability allows PE
to
change the state Of a Switchable Trackside Asset by
sending
corresponding TA State Request to MBS。
MBS has to verify if the request is Valid. If it is valid, MBS carries it out by sending
the corresponding command to the TACS related to the Switchable Trackside
Asset_
Goal
Due to a request from PE, a Switchable Trackside Asset is commanded to change
its state by sending a command to its TACS.

5.8.1 Scenario: Control Switchable Trackside Assets
The figure below contains the main sequence and the failure sequence of the SysC Control
Switchable Trackside Asset。
When the MBS receives a TA State Request, it performs the safety checks (Function: Authorise TA
State Request) for the request。
If the safety checks are successful, MBS responds to PE the granting of the request and translates
the request to a
TACS command (Function: Translate TA State Request to TACS Command). The
TACS command is then sent to the related TACS (Function: Send TACS Command).
If the safety checks fail, MBS responds to PE system the rejecting of the request and performs no
further actions for the request。

FOR FURTHER RELEASE
[X2R5 REQ-Trainloc- 12]
If a train reports a
position that is unexpected or in conflict with other train movements;
the MBS shall react to transition the system to a safe state.
Rationale:
The MBSis reliant upon trains reporting their position to separate traffic safely and the
MBS must therefore react if it detects a potentially hazardous situation.
Guidance:
4
train reporting an unexpected position can be a hazard even when there is TTD x
more than one train is in the same TTD section, but the situation is more severe inan
area Without TTD.
The MBS will only be able to detect conflicts with other train movements which have
been authorised by the MBS.
There are several situations Where a position report from atrain may require immediate
action from the MBS to avoid a potential hazard, for example:
a train reporting a
position in an area previously considered clear, e.9. at Start
Of Mission; OR
a train Which has been allocated a Reserved Status Area reporting
3
position
Which cannot be linked with that Reserved Status Area, OR
a train reporting a position locating it within a Reserved Status Area allocated to
anothertrain。
The specific reaction applied Will depend
on the situation and application specific
requirements. Possible reactions include:
shortening of the Movement Authority for the affected train(s),
sending an Unconditional Emergency Stop message to the affected train(s).

6.9.8 Impact from TTD on Train Locations
REQ-TTD-I
For a system using TTD, the MBS shall manage the asynchronicity between TTD section
status and Train Position Reports for a communicating train。
Rationale:
It Will occur that the train physically occupies a TTD section before i has reported its
position Within the TTD section (or vice versa) Similarly, the train may physically leave
a TTD section before it has reported its position beyond the TTD section (or vice versa):
The MBS must correlate these events.
Guidance:
The MBS must be designed to allow for:
4
TTD section becoming Occupied by a train before the train has reported a
position within the TTD section。
train reporting a position within the TTD section before TTD section becomes
Occupied.
A
TTD section becoming Clear after a train has left the TTD section before the
train has reported a position clear of the TTD section。

Shorten the front of the Train Location for this train, by the extent of each TTD section that
is detected Clear between the Min Safe Front End and the Max Safe Front End.
Rationale:
TTD information can be used to improve the MBS knowledge about the status of the
track in the Area of Control, thus improving the performance of the system。
Guidance:
The effect of a Clear TTD section in the front part of a
Train Location is to
update the

This can be used to avoid locking points and level crossings in front of the train. Both
the reception of TTD status and the receiving of a Train Position Report can be the
trigger for updating the Train Location.

If the Mute Timer is not considered for use on a particular
application, the MBS shall react
Wwhen
the

Train Object into
an
Unresolved
Trackbound Object. The Unresolved Trackbound Object
shall correspond to the Train
Location extended to the end of the

Rationale:
This is So that;
even for
applications not utilising the
Mute timer functionality; the
Trackside is protected
when communications
With
a
train expire according to the
existing session expiry timer in the ETCS specifications [BL3 R2].
Guidance:
Whether or not to use the Mute Timer will depend on Whether it is required to detect
loss of communication before expiry of the session timer. This in turn will depend on
traffic density and the typical speed of trains。
Once atrain is reporting in RV mode; it is not able to move forwards without performing
EoM and Start of Mission, so it is not necessary to extend the Unresolved Trackbound
Object to the end of the Movement Permission。

a train length different from
previously reported within the same communication session, then the MBS shall mark the
Train Object as "integrity not confirmed'
Rationale:
If the train reports loss of Train Integrity because of joining or splitting, then this Will
already result in the Train Object marked as "integrity not confirmed" . This requirement
is to cover the situation Where the new train length is received before the loss of Train
Integrity
Guidance:
When new train data is entered, the OBU will not confirm Train Integrity until the new
train data
is acknowledged by the
MBS.

The MBS shall mark the Train Object as "integrity not confirmed
When 'No train integrity

Rationale:
This is to provide to other consumers entity as PE the information about the train

Guidance:
Once Train Integrity is considered Lost by the MBS, the mechanism in REQ-LOsSTI-2
is
applied。
It is application specific Whether to implement this function。
The timer will have
a
Value that means the function is disabled.
Note that using this timer the Driver will not be aware of the train Integrity being treated
as Lost by the MBS and as such cannot be expected to reactin any manner。
If the MBS is configured not to accept Train Integrity confirmed by Driver, and Train
Integrity confirmed by Driver is reported, then the
MBS
will treat this as "No train
integrity information" .
There is no specific relation between the length of the Mute Timer and the Integrity
Wait timer。

6.10 SYSF MANAGE UNRESOLVED TRACKBOUND OBJECT
6.10.1
Overview
The MBS must be aware of all parts of the track that are potentially occupied.
For communicating trains that are localised , the occupancy is managed by the Train
Location inside Train Object. The MBS will create and
a Train Object for each
communicating train.
For all other situations, the (potential) occupancy is managed by Unresolved Trackbound
Object. The MBS will create and
Unresolved Trackbound Object in these cases。
An
Unresolved Trackbound Object may exist for a specific train, but may also exist for another
reason, not associated with a specific train。
There are several reasons to create or extend an Unresolved Trackbound Object, as shown in

6.10.2
Propagation concept
The concept of propagation is based on the idea that an Unresolved Trackbound Object needs to
be increased, possibly after a period of time;
to allow for the fact that any railway vehicles in the
Unresolved Trackbound Object area may move without knowledge of the MBS.
Within a signalling system with 100% Trackside Train Detection (TTD), any movement which crosses
a TTD boundary is likely to be detected (see REQ-TTD-9, REQ-TTD-10, REQ-TTD-12).
In case of Ioss of communication, the
Movement Permission is also considered
35
3
possible
envelope for movements of non-reporting vehicles (see REQ-TrainLoc- 10).
Without TTD or if the TTD is already occupied, movements of non-reporting rail vehicles Will not be
detected by the MBS。
For stationary vehicles, the period oftime before propagation is applied could be associated with the
length of time for Which railway Vehicle brakes can be expected to remain active, and so keep the
Vehicle(s) stationary。
Measures are generally
in place at railway project level to prevent or detect and mitigate the risk
Of rolling vehicles moving such that
conflict with other movements:
Use of trap points or derailers in station areas andlor sidings
Use of Trackside Train Detection in station areas andlor sidings
If hazard analysis on a particular railway identifies that the remaining risk of unexpected vehicle
movement causing a collision is still not acceptable; MBS includes a propagation algorithm within
TTD (see REQ-TrainLoc- 14, REQ-TrainLoc- 15 and REQ-TrainLoc- 16) to mitigate this risk。

When Train Integrity is confirmed by External Source for a

delete all UTOs matching the length of this train。
Rationale:
The Unresolved Trackbound Object is "replaced" by the Train Location of the

When Train Integrity is confirmed by External Source for a

Recorded Train Length, then the MBS shall:
remove the part of the Unresolved Trackbound Object between the Min Safe Front

rear ends, AND
reduce the Recorded Train Length of the remaining Unresolved Trackbound Object
by the length of the train that confirmed Train Integrity, AND
dissociate the Unresolved Trackbound Object from this train
Rationale:
This is required for the MBS to maintain the Unresolved Trackbound Object within its
Area of Control whenall the train length recorded foran Unresolved Trackbound Object
is not accounted for by a train confirming integrity.
Guidance:
An Unresolved Trackbound Object cannot be fully recovered ifthe reported train length
does
not account for all the train length recorded for that area。
In this
case, the
Unresolved Trackbound Object must remain with the recorded train length reduced by
the length of the train that confirmed integrity.
The extent of the Unresolved Trackbound Object will also be reduced because the new
Train Location Will sweep the part of the Unresolved Trackbound Object from its Min
Safe Front End to the Max Safe Rear End. This could result in this area being split in
depending on the Train Location. In that case the recorded train length is the same
for both Unresolved Trackbound Object。

can be the configurable minimum length of Unresolved Trackbound Object, as defined
in ENG-Generic-3.
Additionally, projects may decide to additionally remove the UTO in front of the train in
case the MBS can unambiguously determine that there is no other (part of a) train in

FOR FURTHER RELEASE
[X2R5 REQ-TrackStatus- 16]
When the MBS considers the communication session with a train is terminated, the MBS
shall convert the Train Location to an Unresolved Trackbound Object, except if the train
is completely located inside an Active Shunting Area。
Rationale:
This is the area Where the train could be located,and as such needs to be protected
by an Unresolved Trackbound Object。
Guidance:
This requirement applies at EoM for trains not inside an Active Shunting Area。
For a train located completely inside an Active Shunting Area, there is no need foran
Unresolved
Trackbound Object since there is already
an
Unresolved
Trackhbound
Object associated with the Active Shunting Area Which will protect the train.
Ifatrain is partially located inside an Active Shunting Area, it is project specific whether
the MBS authorises the transition to Shunting Mode. Similarly, it is project specific how
the MBS subsequently manages the overlapping Unresolved Trackbound Object that
is created for the location of this train。
For
a
train leaving
the
MBS
Area,
another requirement
deals
with
the
relevant
Unresolved Trackbound Object that could be removed When the train has left the area
i.e. before the communication session has been terminated.
Loss of communications is handled by other requirements。

Removing an Unresolved Trackbound Object
REQ-TrackStatus-19
The MBS shall automatically remove Unresolved Trackbound Object for which the extent
is less than or equal to a configurable minimum length.
Rationale:
This is to avoid
having small Unresolved Trackbound Object that have to be swept
When it is known that there cannot be a vehicle inside them.
Guidance:
Small Unresolved Trackbound Object could arise from splitting and joining procedures,
Or from sweeping.

For example; this requirement could apply to cross-over areas, as in Figure 40:
Figure 40: Short Unresolved Trackbound Object at crossover
The configurable minimum length could be related to the length of the shortest vehicle
that could be running on the line. The Unresolved Trackbound Object can be removed,
regardless of the status of adjacent areas。
In case an Unresolved Trackbound Object is split in two, e.9. by a clear TTD section,
and xf one of these areas is shorter than the configured minimum distance, then it can

Impact from TTD on Unresolved Trackbound Objects

Fora
System using TTD, the MBS shall remove all or part of a Unresolved Trackbound
Object, corresponding to a TTD section which is Clear。
Rationale:
TTD information can be used to clear the track under degraded situations。
Guidance:
TTD can assist with recovery as there is no need to sweep clear TTD sections。
Only the part of the Unresolved Trackbound Object corresponding to the Clear TTD
section can be removed according to this requirement. This might mean that part of
the Unresolved Trackbound Object may remain。

For

System using
TTD;
i the
MBS
has
shortened
the
extent
Of
an
Unresolved
Trackbound Object;
then the MBS shall ensure the resulting
Unresolved Trackbound
Object is not shorter than the Recorded Train Length stored for it。
Rationale:
Applying shortening could result in the extent of the remaining Unresolved Trackbound
Object being less than the Recorded Train Length.
An Unresolved Trackbound Object with an extent shorter than the stored train length
could represent a hazard。
Guidance:
When the
application of shortening the Unresolved Trackbound Object results in the
length of the Unresolved Trackbound Object being less than Recorded Train Length,
iis
project specific What alternative action the MBS takes. For example; an
application
may decide to not apply any shortening to the Unresolved Trackbound Object; or to
apply equal shortening to the front and
rear
Whilst maintaining the length of the
Recorded Train Length。
If an Unresolved Trackbound Object is one part of an Unresolved Trackbound Object
which has been split, for example by a clear TTD, then project-specific rules may be
needed,as the Recorded Train Length will be recorded in two Unresolved Trackbound
Objects; see REQ-TrackStatus-11 .

not associated with any

Rationale:
TTD
occupancy
not associated
with
any expected train
movement should
be
considered a
potential hazard。
Guidance:
Unexpected TTD occupancy also includes a TTD remaining Occupied when it might
be expected to become Clear. For example, a TTD remaining Occupied behind a train
which has sent a Train Position Report which gives a position clear of the TTD might
indicate the presence of a Ghost Train. Implementation of such a function is project-
specific and will likely require the use of a timer to compensate for the latency between
Train Position Reports and TTD inputs。

For a
System using TTD, when detecting a TTD clearance Which cannot be associated
With any regular train movement or Train Location, the MBS shall create an Unresolved

by UTO,
oris known as cleared (by TTD ifavailable).
Rationale:
4
TTD clearance Which cannot be associated with any regular train movementor Train
Location, should be considered a potential hazard, as such the MBS needs to protect
other
train
movements
by
either creating
Or
extending
Unresolved

Guidance:
A TTD becoming unexpectedly clear might be due to several reasons. For example; a
non-communicating train is moved such that the TTD becomes clear。
The MBS must react, for example by creating an additional Unresolved Trackbound
Objects to protect the movement of trains。
Figure 41 shows the creation of Unresolved Trackbound Objects adjacent to a Clear

Overview
This function is responsible to assess the safety of a request to alter the Authorisation of a
Train
Object. PE or the operator through the operator panel can request an Authorisation through the SCI-
CMD interface which is then checked by MBS if it violates any safety constraint The MBS shall not
alter the request if certan parameters are incorrect (e.9. The operating state has changed during the
message transmission between PE and MBS) but only report the failure to PE with the failure reason。
The MP Request shall contain the following information:
Train Object Identifier
Movement Permission
The Movement Permission shall have the following attributes
Risk Buffer (LinkedPath)
Extent (LinkedPath)
Requested Maximum Speed in kmlh (LinkedPath per different speed)
ETCS Movement Mode (Linked Path per different mode)
List of DPS Groups that must not be used as flank protection measure
6.11.1.1
Flank Protection Overview
Before authorizing an MP request, MBS evaluates if sufficient protections to limit the risk of side-on
collision according to the safety analysis are in observed between the requested MP and any
uncontrolled trackbound movement。
To find the flank protecting measures applicable to the MP request, MBS builds Risk Path
Candidates that span from the end of the Allocation Sections up to the corresponding elements
providing (or not) flank protection (see requirement REQ-RP_
SEARCH):
Note: once a risk path has been created, it may also be updatedldeleted without the reception of a
new MP request (e.9. when a train is moving) through a continuous evaluation (see chapter 6.18)
Foreach Risk Path Candidate that has been built (according to REQ-SC_
RP_SEARCH), the MBS
evaluates 讦 the Risk Path is correctly terminated (according to REQ-SC_
RP_TERM) on an
element authorised to provide flank protection.
The elements than can provide flank protections include:
Switchable Track element
Examples: point from trailing side, derailerlcatch point, end of track, etc.
The position of these points ensures that any uncontrolled trackbound movement
approaching the side of the Movement Permission will be deviated or derailed.

The side of the Movement Permission is protected by another train supervised by
3
Movement Permission. As the ETCS on-board unit of the other train supervises the train
movement; this reduces the risk that the train Will exceed its authority to an extent that
could resultin a flank collision
Train Object
The side of the Movement Permission is protected by another connected train. If the on-
board unit guarantees that the train Will not move Without any authority, it is ensured that
this train Will not perform any movements that could result in a flank collision.
Protection by a sufficient distance
The side of the Movement Permission is detected as free over a sufficient distance to
mitigate the risk a flank collision to an acceptable level
Protection by Operational Rules
If the risk of flank collision cannot be mitigated by the preceding measures, the final
option is to reduce the potential consequences of a flank collision x Operational Rules
(vehicle should not be moved without permission) are violated。
This imposes a reduced speed.

Points and derailers provide flank protection by
means that no train can physically
move towards the flank protection seeking element; if the

INTERFACE SPECIFICATIONS
7.1
DESCRIPTION OF THE EXTERNAL INTERFACE
TACS
7.1.1
Role of the external interface
The interface
TACS allows the Moving Block System:
to send commands to the TACS to move switchable TAs to the required state, and
to receive from the TACS the state of the TA。
Indeed, to enable a train run from
A
to B, the Moving Block System commands to the TACS the
setting of the TA to the required state to allow the movement of the train from
Ato B.
To manage the train positioning and the movement of the trains, the Moving Block System also
needs to acquire through the TACS the state of all the TA inside its Area of Control (AoC.)
The interface
TACS covers the following interfaces defined in EULYNX:
Subsystem
Train Detection System (SCI-TDS) i TTD is used
Subsystem
Point (SCI-P)

According to EULYNX, TACS communicates either by UDP or
TLS over TCP。
For new components, it is highly recommended to Use TLS over
TCP。

7.4.1
Role of the external interface
By this interface, MBS gets the static Topology Data. This is the case both at startup and during run-
time Where there is the possibility to
existing Topology Data to a new version. Particularly it
is possible to exchange a part of existing Topology Data e.9. as result Of construction work。

Until release 4, Topology Data Will cover the Whole Area of Control and will immediately be valid
(activated) after reception.

In a further release; Topology Data can cover an arbitrary part of the Area of Control and follow a
lifecycle:
First, they will be distributed (pre-loaded)
Then, MBS will be asked for authorisation of the Topology Data activation where it checks
for conflicting
Movement Permissions
and
讦
there
is
no conflict; establishes
3
Usage
Restriction Area to keep the updated area free of future Movement Permissions until the
activation is finished
Then, Topology Data become pre-activated and MBS can start to synchronise With the TACS
(of changed or new Trackside Assets)
Finally, MBS is asked for activation, removes the Usage Restriction Area and uses the new
data from now on

AlI messages carry this generic header
Parameter: messageNumber (unique identifier of the message type)
Parameter: messagelength (total length of message)
Parameter: dateTime (sending date and timestamp of message)
Further on, the parameter consumerld will be the unique identification of MBS (configurable value)
The parameter Domainld is under discussion。
It currently pretends that updateable Topology Data
areas are fixed (pre-configured) but i shall be achieved that any sub-area, Which cannot be pre-
defined, shall be updateable. Until clarification it is used below, but the inherent future meaning shall
be that the Topology Data themselves (parameter requestedDomainData are such that they allow
identification of what sub-area they are replacing; the Domainld would then not be needed anymore.
Hint: for the mismatch of Topology Data and Domain Data (reflected in message names below) see

GLOSSARY
Check: General procedure Which ascertains if certain conditions hold (e.9., [check 讯 each end ofa
railway point is connected to a track section).
Configuration
Data:
Further information relevant for system operation that is not contained in
topology, topography or infrastructure data (e.9., identifiers & connection parameters for object
controllers and parameters for safety checks. 
Static Speed Profile: A static speed profile thatis dynamically calculated by MBS and subsequently
provided to the relevant train onboard unit。
Hazard:
hazard is defined as "a system state or set of conditions that, together With a particular
set of worst-case environmental conditions, will lead to a loss" [1].
Infrastructure data:
Additional information
not contained in the topography but necessary for
physical train operations (e.9., static speed profiles, cant,
Loss:
Within STPA,
a loss is defined as an unacceptable event which harms "something of value
to stakeholders. " [1]. Typical values to protect include human life (loss of life), system function (Ioss
Of mission), the environment (Ioss of environment), etc。
Movement Authority: Permission for a train to run to a specific location within the constraints of the
infrastructure [19].
Movement Permission: Request from PE to MBS to grant a defined MA for a certain train。
Safety Design Recommendation: Exported less stringent "recommendation" regarding the findings
in this document versus more stringent "safety requirements'
that may result from a later generation
of this analysis.
Safety Requirement:
A requirement based on findings from a safety analysis (see safety design
recommendation).
Safety Responsibility: Defined responsibility with regards to safety functions of individual actors;
systems or sub-systems.
Topography: Refers to geographical map information regarding the features of the terrain that
correctly represent physical reality (geographical position, elevation,
)
Topology: Subset of topography with linked track sections and identified track elements。
Unsafe Control Action: "An
Unsafe Control Action (UCA)is a control action that, in a particular
context and worst-case environment, will lead to a hazard" [1
System Level Constraints: "A system-level constraint specifies system conditions or behaviours
that need to be satisfied to prevent hazards (and ultimately prevent losses)" [1.
Validation: "Confirmation, through the provision of objective evidence; that the requirements for a
Specific intended
USe
or application have been fulfilled. "[3] This
means Validation is intended to
ensure that the MBS meets the operational needs of the user。
Verification: "Confirmation , through the provision of objective evidence, that specified requirements
have been fulfilled. "[3] This means verification is intended to check that the MBS meets its set of
design specifications。

INTRODUCTION
This present document constitutes the technical contribution from Task 13.3 "Safety Analysis" to the
Deliverable 013.1 "Moving Block Specifications applying a train-centric approach" in the framework
Of WP13, of FP2 R2DATO.
"The objective of this task Was to work collaboratively to analyze the impact of System Pillar activities
and Tasks (13.1 Definition/ 13.2 Specification ) to develop a Moving Block Safety Analysis considering
also the S2Rresults.
IR2DATO Grant Agreementl
To move
a step beyond
What
was previously done in S2R (e.9., in-depth analysis of relevant
scenarios) a novel method
called System Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA)
shallbe
applied to
the matter。 This STPA focuses on "unsafe control actions" in control and feedback Ioops within
complex systems. An advantage over previous methods is the potential to identify emergent risks
stemming from the interaction between those (sub)systems, Which are often overlooked。
The subject of this analysis is the "Moving Block System" (MBS) that is being defined and specified
in IP13.
The figure below Shows its localization within the planned Moving Block Demonstrator
(MBD)from WP44/45. In this preliminary architecture it is foreseen that the MBS receives its topology
model (Domain Data) from an entity designated as Digital Register (DR). Various commands and
requests (e.9., requests to move a pointlrequest to grant a movement permission) come from the
Plan Execution (PE) that executes the operational plan from the Traffic Management System (TMS).
Onthe other side, MBS facilitates communication with and also commands the Onboard-Units (OBU)
and Trackside Asset Control & Supervision (TACS)
aka trackside object controllers。

The approach is "train-centric" in the sense that the physical train itself is considered as the main
business object instead of indirectly deriving information about the train only by monitoring track
occupations. Since
We apply "moving
block principles" ,
movement authorities can therefore
be
issued up to any point on the track, and trains can safely follow each other in absolute braking
distance without being bound to wait for the next block section to become free. However, the system
Shall still be able to utilize information from previously installed Train Detection Systems (TDS) to
complement and improve localization information where applicable (e.9. if receiving a OBU radio
transmission takes longer than receiving occupation information from the TDS), andlor for migration
purposes. Some advantages of the new system are:
potential performance gains due to smaller train headway times。
reduced efforts for TDS and obsolete lineside signals (cab side signaling)。
the merger of interlocking and RBC functionality, that enables the MBS system to
eVen
consider physical trains (since traditional IXL Was only concerned about securing routes).
the concentration of safety related functions into
as few "safety-critical'
components
35
possible (thereby reducing the SIL requirement for other components).
the (envisaged) capability of runtime configuration updates。
(envisaged) improved supplier independence due to openlfully defined interfaces。
MBSis thus by design "the component performing safety related functions " within this novel trackside
CS. The implications of this approach on overall system safety are of great interest。
Previous investigations
Were focused
on train localization (performance), radio communication
(performance and availability), cold movement detection, as Well as train length- and train integrity
data. Ideally, the safety requirements from there can be mapped to the new results. However, a
focus of this analysis are the control (inter-)actions and feedback between the adjacent systems
(e.9., What are the main hazards that emerge from command and feedback loop between MBS and
3
safety operator panel):

SCOPE
The analysis for the Task 13.3 details the results of the safety analysis with focus on the MBS and
its interfaces to the other internal and external systems, as depicted in Figure 2
MBS System
Boundary. It is based on the STPA analysis method for the current safety analysis and considers the
result from the former X2Rail project。
The STPA analysis proved to be the most suitable method at
3
time,
when the system requirements
and the system design
were still subject to significant
changes. Like in traditional safety methods, the efforts involved are highly dependent on the levelof
depth to which the STPA shall be conducted, and since the task resources are limited (due to overall
WP allocation as Well as due to the number of active authors) an adaptive approach is applied. While
the
Whole system-stack involved in "command control & signaling" shall be covered at
a
high
abstraction level, certain points of interest (e.9., Where valuable information for feedback to the
specification task can be generated) can
be investigated
on a lower abstraction level, down to
individual controllfeedback telegrams。
The analysis does not provide all the evidence to obtain certification
Or to fulfil the mandatory
requirements or design standards (e.9:
EN50126-1and -2,EN50128,
EN50129,
EN50159,
However, it Will define safety related design recommendations Which shall be considered during the
development of the MBS and may be mapped to safety requirements in a later stage。
The overall analysis of the whole Moving Block Demonstrator (MBD) as depicted in Figure
below
is covered in WP44145 (Task 45.5.)
2.1
SYSTEM BOUNDARY
As briefly described in the introduction, the system boundary of MBS is defined through interfaces
within the Moving Block Demonstrator (MBD) (e.9., LPE,LDR) and also to the outside of the MBD
(e.9.,
TACS,
TACS).
Even though similar definitions have already been produced within Task
13.1,13.2 and 44.3 We decided to reproduce (copylupdatelrewrite) such a section here
at least
until the documents from these tasks are in a stable Version。
Within this section there is also a
description of all the subsystems depicted in the drawing below . Relevant Interface descriptions can
be found in chapter 6 Interface Criticality together with
3
preliminary analysis of the interface
criticality. The handover to neighboring systems is out of scope for this analysis。

SAFETY ANALYSIS METHODEOLOGY
This chapter describes the used safety analysis methodologies on a very high abstraction level. Even
though some aspects of the larger demonstrator (MBD) architecture have to be taken into account;
the target of this safety analysis is the Moving Block System (MBS). The analysis is partly based on
outputs from predecessor projects, such as X2Rail and RCA, but it also relies on inputs from system
pillar, as Well as the results from connected tasks within R2DATO.
The envisaged goal for the demonstrator (MBD) is TRL (Technology Readiness Level) 6 [20]. At this
stage; the complete safety analysis is qualitative only, not quantitative. Quantitative methods, such
as fault trees to Verify specific safety objectives, may be added in a later stage when a higher TRL
Shall be achieved.
Figure 3 shows the scope of the safety analysis in the so called "hourglass model' from CENELEC
EN 50126-2.

COMMON SAFETY METHODS
For safety-relevant
changes
to
railroad   systems (e.9,
technical,
operational,
regulative
Or
organizational changes), the risk assessment process in accordance With EU regulations 2015/1136
and 402/2013 (CSM-RA) must be applied。
However, technical changes to a system that are handled with the RAMS management process of
the CENELEC standard EN 50126 (+128/129) are generally compliant with the CSM procedure.
4.2
CENELEC STANDARDS
Tasks 13.1and 13.2 Within work package 13 are developed along the relevant CENELEC standards。
Thus, the following standards apply:
EN 50126-1.2017: Generic RAMS Process
EN 50126-2:2017: Systems Approach to Safety
EN
50716:2023:
Requirements
for
Software
development (supersedes
EN
50128:2011:
Software)
EN 50129:2018: Electronic systems
They shall be applied as far as practicable for a TRL 6 system. This means that the standards will
be taken as a major input for the development, but some requirements may be interpreted in a more
relaxed way as it would be the case for a fully operational system。
4.3
STPA
The STPA handbook [1] describes the practical application of STPA in great detail. Here, we only
provide a very short description and the reason why STPA was chosen。
STPA (System-Theoretic Process Analysis) is a
method to identify hazards and related system
constraints in complex systems, in orderto identify (unsafe) control actions that lead to those hazards
(and related losses). Mitigations to avoid these unsafe control actions can then be derived.
The reason Why STPA
was chosen is that it is geared towards large and complex systems with
multiple interactions, Where hazards do not necessarily only arise due to component failures, but
also due to emergent behavior involving multiple components。
The MBS (especially in combination
With its interfaces and interactions with the environment) is a novel system, for Which this method is
believed to be of great value.

RISKANALYSIS
This chapter details and documents the results of the conducted STPA analysis as described in
chapter 4.3. The analysis focuses on the marked section of the "hourglass model from CENELEC
EN 50126-2 as Shown in Figure 3 Which is intended to derive the safety requirements from operator
point Of view. These requirements must be considered by the suppliers of an MBS system。
The
supplier's safety analysis shall consider these requirements as their safety goals, that can be broken
down into further sub safety
and requirements。

LOSSES
The first step of the STPA is to define Which losses to consider for the analysis。
The purpose of the
analysis is to find possible causes for accidents. An accidentis defined as an undesired or unplanned
event that results in a loss。
A loss always involves something of value to the stakeholder. Typical
examples are loss of human life or injury, but also property damage; environmental pollution or loss
of mission. [1] For this analysis, three main losses are considered:

Table 11
Losses
Explicitly excluded from this analysis are loss of mission and loss of customer satisfaction, as our
focus for this analysis is strictly on safety (e.9., a person's life)
5.2
HAZARDS
The next step of the analysis is to find the system level hazards。
Within STPA,
a hazard is defined
35
a System state or setof conditions that, together with a particular set of worst-case environmental
conditions, will lead to a loss" [1]. Note that this definition differs from the classical definition of a
hazard.
It is essential that hazards
are defined at system level instead of component level;
35
hazards
may
also
arise
from the
interaction  between components
and
cannot necessarily
be
assigned to a single component:
A
System is defined as
a set of components that act together as a Whole to achieve some common
objective; or end" [1]. It may contain subsystems and the analysis may be based higher or
lower level of abstraction of individual subsystems as needed.
In order to identify system level hazards; i is therefore necessary to identify the system under
consideration and the analysis boundary as defined in chapter 2.1 System Boundary. A useful way
to define the analysis boundary may be to include only systems within the analysis boundary over
which the system designers have some form of control。
To ease readability the hazards are described in a generic form。
Each hazard may have multiple
sub-hazards, further detailing the high-level hazard。
The hazards differentiate between losses in connection with other trains and hazards in connection
with "other obstacles"
For the purposes Of this analysis, runaway trains are regarded as "other
obstacles"

HIERARCHICAL CONTROL STRUCTURE (HCS)
The hierarchical control structure models the system using functional components called controllers。
Higher level controllers may enforce constraints on the controlled system by using control actions.
Additionally, controllers may receive information from other controllers as feedback。 Together the
controllers form feedback control loops, shaping the overall behavior of the system。
Which actions a controller performs is determined by its control algorithm, representing the decision-
making process. The information available to the controller at decision time is represented by the
process model.A simple case of a control feedback
is illustrated in Figure 5.

represent a single system or multiple system. A controller may be a human as Well as a technical
system. The control structure may be represented using multiple levels, where system details for
lower levels are added as needed for the analysis。
Avery high-level control structure for the CCS system is shown in Figure 6.

ASSUMPTIONS
When analyzing a (not yet fully specified) system, a number of assumptions about its environment
and internal operations are needed. Assumptions from the WP13 System Definition (as recorded in
[1]) are used Where they are directly relevant for the safety analysis。
The corresponding System
Description IDs are referenced at the end of the assumptions in square brackets where applicable。

[ASM-2]
MBS receives position information from the trains OBU and uses
[61]
the train position information to derive movement authorities (train
centric approach).
[ASM-3]
Only ETCS Level 2 (previously Level 2/3 or R) equipped trains are
[62]
supported by the MBS during normal operation. Trains Without
TIMSare
supported for migration scenarios, When TTDs are
available.
[ASM-4]
MBS does not require TTDs but supports them for migration
[63]
scenarios。
[ASM-5]
MBS aims to have as little manual intervention (e.9. by the
[64]
operator) as possible.
[ASM-6]
MBS operation assumes trains are equipped with a TIMS (Train
[65]
integrity monitoring system) . However, in degraded modes and for
migration purposes operation Without TIMS is supported as well。
[ASM-T]
MBS is responsible for safety control and should contain a generic
[A2]
and simple safety logic. The operational commands are generated
by other systems。
[ASM-8]
Train length and train integrity confirmation are relevant for a SIL
[TO]
4 functions and therefore have to be provided with appropriate
correctness guarantees for these functions。
[ASM-9]
The train length reported by the OBU represents the maximum
[T]
train length (e.9. after stretching).
[ASM-10]
Changes in the communication technology to the Trains wi
[T2]
neither affect the content of the messages defined in the ETCS
Definitions nor the transit time (TBD $) of the messages between
the Moving Block System and the trains。
[ASM-11]
MBS functionality does not change Whether the train is operated
[T3,T4]
bya human driver or ATO.
[ASM-12]
MBS requires that the cold movement of trains is detected.
This
[T7
could be performed e.9. by a cold movement detection device
(CMD device):
[ASM-13]
The Train OBUand the infrastructure elementsloCs are SIL-4
Systems。

The integrity of communication between the train OBU and MBS
is ensured by a SIL-4
System。
[ASM-16]
The integrity of communication between the train infrastructure
elementsloCs and MBS is ensured by a SIL-4 system。
[ASM-17]
Object controllers are correctly installed and configured.
This can
be checked by operational procedures with optional automated
support (e.9. flagging the configuration as correct after multiple
successful train passings) (i.e. the position reported by a railway
point will not be incorrect due to
wiring of the 4-wire-bus).
[ASM-18]
Every train is identified by a unique and unchangeable identifier。
[ASM-19]
MBS assumes that the train is declared compliant (zugelassen")
with the tracks by the IM
[ASM-20]
A train must be able to stop before the EoAldanger point. The
braking curve is supervised by the trains OBU。
[ASM-2]
Safety Related text messages Will not be sent by the operator。
Instead, such message should be generated by automated
systems (e.9., MBS):
[ASM-22]
Interaction between the operator ana MBS only involves safety
related information.
[ASM-23]
Other interactions of the operator with the system are done via the
PE or the TMS.
[ASM-25]
Allinformation received from the operator panelis relevant for one
AoC only. This implies that it is not necessary to exchange this
information between MBS and neighbouring systems。
[ASM-26]
The received information about the infrastructure (geographical
position of tracks, points, etc. ) correctly represent physical reality。
An external controller is responsible for the data validation
process. Rationale: MBS safety functions depend on this input but
cannot verify the input independently.
[ASM-27]
When train integrity is lost, the main reservoir pipe is Vented and
the train emergency breaks engage.
[ASM-28]
Operator informs the MBS, about all regions where a train
movement has been manually authorised by the operator. This
also includes situations, where the radio connections to the OBU
is lost。

The responsibilities of MBS essentially comprise the following areas:
Assess risk of commands for trains and infrastructure elements. Reject commands, which Will
resultin an unsafe situation. Forward or process safety-validated commands。
Intervention f risk of railway accidents is not tolerable (e.9., point in reservation area loses its
end position, train moving too fast, runaway trains,
)
Safe communication with trains and field elements
Provide an up-to-date; reliable and consistent system view of trains, infrastructure and other
relevant parties (e.9., level crossings)

CONTROLLOOP ANALYSIS
In the following, relevant control and feedback Ioops are considered across the most important
interfaces.
Later in the analysis, these can be explored in greater depth or the respective systems
can be broken down into smaller controllerslactors。
1
subset of the unsafe control actions Was selected for further scenario generation. This Was done
due to the focus on changes system design, where the behavior of the moving block system differs
from traditional fixed block systems。

Scenarios for ynsafe controlactions:
[S1-UCA-OP-1]: Two railway points P1 and P2 report a lost end position and are unable to execute
throwover commands by the operator. As the railway points are within close proximity, a single
maintenance team is dispatched to investigate the two points. The maintenance team is able to fix
the position of P1 and reports work completed this to the Operator. The operator mistakenly believes
the team also fixed the position of point P2, which the team Was also tasked to investigate。
As a
result, the operator provides an infrastructure state not matching reality to MBS [UCA-OP-1]
二>
[SDR-1]: Provide an operational rule set which explicitly determines to which infrastructure item

completed
safety related) intervention referslreferred to.
[S2-UCA-OP-2]: When passing a protected level crossing, the train driver notices that the bars on
one side are not fully closed and reports this to the operator. As this particular level crossing had
problems in the past, the operator mistakenly believes that this was already entered into the operator
panel. As a result, a required URA is not applied to the MA [UCA-OP-2].
二>
[SDR-2]: When changes to the operational state are reported by personnel,
the operator shall
always check if they are already entered in the operation state of MBS, even i the operator believes
this
has
already
been
done
in
the
past

[SDR-3]: The operator panel shall provide easily accessible information on all currently manually
entered infrastructure state With the required confidence for a safety related function.
[S3-UCA-OP-3]:
A

The
construction is scheduled sequentially so that the impact on the railway traffic is minimized。
Due to
unforeseen problems on site; the construction order of the points is switched and this is reported to
the operator. As the operators shift ends shortly and the change only affects the next shift, he leaves
a note for the next shift. When the next shift starts, an operational disturbance keeps the operator

busy. As a result, the note concerning the construction schedule is read only after construction has
already begun and the operator reports the known operational state to MBS too late [UCA-OP-3]
>
[SDR-4]:
The interface for the operator shall allow to pre-schedule usage restriction areas。
二>
[SDR-5]: The operator shift handover shall include either an operational process or digital means
that prevent a loss of (safety related) information during the handover。
[S4-UCA-OP-4]: Due to construction work, a temporary usage restriction area with a speed reduction
Shall be established . When entering the speed restriction, the operator makes a typo leading to a
usage restriction area with an excessive speed limit [UCA-OP-4].
二>
[SDR-G]: The operator panel should implement procedures to verify the entered usage restriction
data, before the entered data is passed to the MBS system。
[S5-UCA-OP-5]: Amaintenance team performs work on two tracks T1 and T2 closely located to each
other. When the team reports that it has completed its work for T1 , the operator mistakenly believes
that the Work on both tracks has been completed。
As a result, the operator revokes the usage
restriction area for T1 and T2 when it still should be applied for T2 [UCA-OP-5].
二>
See [SDR-1] and [SDR-3]
[SG-UCA-OP-G]: The operator receives a report from a train driver that there are leaves on the track
reducing braking performance。
The operator knows a corresponding usage restriction has already
been entered by the previous shift. However, this usage restriction has since expired. The operator
mistakenly believes the usage restriction is still applied and as a result does not provide the usage
restriction to the operational state of MBS as needed [UCA-OP-6].
二>
See [SDR-2] and [SDR-3]
[S7-UCA-OP-7]:
An operational disturbance requires the operator to manually manage
a
large
number of trains. As the timetable should be
as much as possible, the operator is under time
pressure. In this situation a construction team reports that it will begin constructions on track TIin
half an hour. The operator takes note and is immediately occupied with train management again。
Due to time pressure; the operator only follows up on the note after the construction has already
begun. As a result, the operator provides the usage restriction area for the construction site too late
to MBS [UCA-OP-7].
>
[SDR-7]: Entering usage restriction areas shall take priority over the regular management of
running trains
二> See also [SDR-4]
[S8-UCA-OP-26]: The operator receives a report from the construction team that construction will be
completed in
half an hour。 However, unforeseen difficulties on the construction site
cause the
operation to take longer Emerged in their work the construction team does not report this delay to
the operator. The operator mistakenly believes that the team has finished their work as planned and
revokes the usage restriction area too early [UCA-OP-26].
二>
[SDR-8]: The operator shall always verify with the construction team on site that the work has
actually been completed before removing the corresponding usage restriction area.
[S9-UCA-OP-14/17/18]: Similar reasoning to [S7-UCA-OP-9] (handling of commands under time
pressure; selecting the wrong train) [UCA-OP-14, UCA-OP-17 , UCA-OP-18]

[S10-UCA-OP-15]: The Operator wants to stop a train before a danger
The interface requires
that the operator enters the stopping position manually。
While entering the stopping position, the
operator makes a typo。
As a result, the operator provides a conditional emergency stop command
with the wrong position.
As the train has already passed this position, the command is ignored by
the OBU [UCA-OP-15].
二>
[SDR-9]: The operator panel shall be designed to support the operator with contextual information
when executing operator commands. |.e. the operator shall be able to select the stopping position
based on an interface With information about the physical elementsltrackside assets and select a
stopping position based on the physical elements position。
[511-UCA-OP-16]: The operator receives information that part of a track has become unexpectedly
occupied. A train currently has a Valid MA over the obstructed portion of the track. The operator
believes the train is still at a large distance from the obstructed portion and issues a
conditional
emergency stop. However, the train position report was outdated and the train is already past the
stopping position for the conditional emergency stop。
As a result, the
operator fails to provide the
required unconditional emergency stop command. [UCA-OP-16]

Scenarios fC Selecteg Unsafe contrglactlions:
The unsafe control actions [UCA-MBS-16] and [UCA-MBS-17] were selected, as
are closely
associated With the running path protection, which may be handled differently between fixed block
and moving block systems。
[S1-UCA-MBS-16] Train T1 is a train composed of two consists, T1a and T1b, With one OBU per
consist. The train is initially at standstill, and both consists are unpowered and coupled and no TTDs
are located at the track. The consists T1a and TIb are uncoupled while the train is powered off. The
driver enters the cab of T1a, opens the desk and enters the validated train data。
He mistakenly
believes that T1b is still coupled and inputs the total of T1a and T1b as train length into the DM.As
the consist T1a is still integer, the TIMS reports integrity confirmed. When PE requests an MA for
T1a from MBS, MBS mistakenly believes that a train with a length of T1 is moved, while in reality
train T1b is still standing on the tracks.
As a result, after releasing the MA behind T1a, MBS grants
another train T2 a MA into the region Where T1b is still standing, leading to a collision [UCA-MBS-
16]
[SDR-11]: MBS shall always be aware When a change of train length is expected (i.e。
due to
splitting and joining)
[S2-UCA-MBS-16] Train T1 with length LEN1 is initially at standstill and located on track TRI. TI is
not equipped with a functioning TIMS and no TTDs are available for TR1 . The driver opens the desk
and enters the validated train data. Due to operational changes, additional cars have been added to
the train. The driver enters a too short train length LEN2, because he is not aware that the train is
longer than during normal operations。
As
he is already behind schedule
and there
are Visual
obstructions blocking his view to the end of the train, the driver confirms the train integrity without
seeing the last train cars. Therefore; MBS mistakenly believes T1 has length LEN2, Which is shorter
than the real train length LEN1, and grants an MA to T1 based on LEN2.As a result, after releasing
the MA behind T1,
MBS grants another train T2 a
MA into the region Where TI is still standing,
leading to a collision [UCA-MBS-16]

[SDR-12]: If MBS is aware of the expected train length (i.e. by transmitting the expected train
length together with the train running number from the PE) it shall compare the expected train length
with the reported train length in the Validated train data and require addition confirmation 讦 the two
lengths differ。
[S3-UCA-MBS-16] Train T1 is initially at parked and located at L1, near the bottom of a Valley。
The
train is powered down and no TTDs are available for this section of the track. After applying the
parking brakes, the railway personal does not add the brake shoes below the wheels。
Therefore;
after the air pressure is no longer sufficient to keep the train at standstill, T1 starts to move towards
the bottom of the valley and is now located at L2. MBS mistakenly believes that T1 is still located at
its last known location L1. As aresult, MBS grants anothertrain T2 a MA into L2, leading to a collision
[UCA-MBS-16]
[SDR-13]: In regions where the parking of vehicles is expected,
methods for detecting the
presence of trains independent oftrain position reports shall be available (i.e. installing TTDs in these
regions)
[S4-UCA-MBS-16] Train T1 is initially at standstill and located at L1. T1is in no power mode and no
TTDs are available。
The driver opens the desk and enters the validated train data。
The OBU does
not know the current train position. The driver therefore tells the operator the train position,
and
requests a staff responsible movement authorization. However, as the driver cannot see the track
kilometer board due to visual obstructions; he mistakenly reports the wrong train position L2 to the
operator. The operator permits a train movement based on a L2, while the train is in reality located
at1.
As a result; MBS grants another train T2 a MA into L1 , leading to a collision [UCA-MBS-16]
[SDR-14]: When moving a train based on a train position transmitted by the driver, the operator
shall perform additional validity checks from a second source (i.e. planned start location of the train)
before granting a SR authorization.
[S5-UCA-MBS-16]: Light Maintenance vehicle M1 is powered off and located at L1 on track TRI.
TRIis equipped with a track circuit TTD1
Which is unable to detect the maintenance Vehicle M1. At
MBS initialization, TTD1 is reported as clear. Therefore; MBS is unaware of the presence of M1 at
L1. As a result, MBS grants another train T1 a MA into L1 , leading to a collision [UCA-MBS-16]
[SDR-15]: When the presence of maintenance vehicles is expected, track circuits alone should
not be sufficient to clear the track, if these circuits can miss occupations by some vehicle types (i.e.
light maintenance vehicles)
Note: This may adversely impact operational performance at system
startup or When clearing areas previously occupied by maintenance Vehicles。
[S1-UCA-MBS-17] Train T1 is at standstill and located at the left track of railway point P1.
The
reported train length of LEN1 or T1 is shorter than the physical train length LEN2. Therefore; MBS
mistakenly assumes that T1 is outside the fouling point of P1. As a result, MBS grants another train
T2 a MA over P1, leading to a flank collision between T1 and T2 [UCA-MBS-17]
see [SDR-12]
[S2-UCA-MBS-17] Unsupervised area UA1 is reachable via the left track of railway point P1. Train
T1 is located in UA1,and neither the UA1 nor the tracks of P1 are equipped with TTDs。
Due to
degraded braking performance, T1 skids outside the region UA1, and beyond the fouling
OfP1
As a result, MBS grants another train T2 a MA over P1, leading to a flank collision between T1and
T2 [UCA-MBS-17]

[S3-UCA-MBS-17] Maintenance vehicle M1 located within worksite W1 on track TRI and equipped
with
movable crane arm.
Track TR2 runs parallel to TRI.
If fully extended, the crane arm of MI
can reach into the maximum permitted clearance gauge TR2。
Because Worksite WI is located on
TRI, MBS mistakenly believes this worksite cannot affect trains running on TR2. As a result, an MA
for another train T2 running on TR2 is granted while the crane arm of M1 is extended into TR2,
leading to a clearance gauge violation [UCA-MBS-17].

[S4-UCA-MBS-17] Train T1 performs end of mission on side Track TRI which is connected to the
main track TR2 via point P1. Due to an operational error the train was not protected against roll-
away。
After some time; the pressure in the brake tanks drops and the train starts to roll toward P1.
In the mean-time another MA was granted for Train T2 on the main track TR2 leading over P1. Since
MBS cannot detect the unexpected occupation on P1 nor the unexpected vacancy of the TTD on TI
in time; train T1 collides with train T2 leading to a flank collision.
[SDR-18] Simple detection of track occupation is not sufficient to prevent flank collisions in all
cases. Technical means to secure a sufficiently large Vacant area before the fouling
is required。
[S5-UCA-MBS-17] A side-track TR1 is equipped with TTD and via the point P1 connected to the
main track TR2.
Train T1 and train T3 are both located in the same TTD are on track TRI. Both
trains have performed end of mission. Due to an operational error train T1 was not secured against
roll-away. After break tank pressure drops, the train T1 rolls toward P1.

a shorter track. As a result, a train is authorized to enter the side track and collides with the buffer

[SDR-21] An operational rule may be required, that ensures that any infrastructure changes have

a URA was foreseen. However, MBS was not commanded to activate this URA before the following

From the MBS module perspective; the following interfaces are analysed according to their safety
relevance to determine which of the interfaces are safety related. The interfaces are further analysed
about the kind of communication (unidirectional or bidirectional):
This classification shall help to
reduce the development effort for such kind of interfaces Which are connecting the MBS to non-

Use TTD where trains start after NP mode. However, this is not enough on its

COMPILED DESIGN RECOMMENDATIONS
This chapter contains the compiled safety design recommendations for the analyzed control loops

Although
these

recommendations
Should
be
self-explanatory,

might
make
Sense
to
look
UP
the
linked
(hypothetical) scenarios for each, that led to unsafe control actions in the chapters above
8.1
UNSAFE CONTROL ACTIONS TOWARDSON BOARD UNIT
S>[SDR-13]:
In
regions
Where the parking
Of Vehicles is expected,
methods for detecting the
presence oftrains independent oftrain position reports shall be available (i.e. installing TTDs in these
regions)
Rationale Uncontrolled train movements, like runaway cars after parking, are not constrained by a
movement authority. Such a scenario is described in [S3-UCA-MBS-16]
二>
[SDR-16]:

and

region;
the
movement
of
non
communicating trains shall be detectable;

Or
preventable
3
pointlderailer
(similar to [SDR-13])
Rationale Detecting or preventing the presence of uncontrolled trains out of unsupervised regions
(e.9. at the borders of the region of control) is needed for assumption 2。
A
corresponding scenario
is described in [S2-UCA-MBS-17].
[SDR-18] Simple detection of track occupation is not sufficient to prevent flank collisions in all
cases. Technical means to secure a sufficiently large Vacant area before the fouling
is required.
Rationale Even when the train presence is detected according to assumption 1 ., the reaction times
can be insufficient to prevent a flank collision hazard, making further measures necessary:
[ASM-4-vz] MBS does not require TTDs for controlled train movement but supports them for
migration purposes or systems Where the chance of uncontrolled movement cannot be sufficiently
controlled by other means。
Rationale The assumption that TTDs can completely be eliminated while still guarding against all
loss scenarios found in our analysis is too strong. As long as uncontrolled train movement cannot
be eliminated, their presence is still required。

二>
[SDR-11]: MBS shall always be aware When a change of train length is expected (i.e。
due to
splitting and joining)
Rationale If the MBS detects an unexpected difference between the reported and expected train
length, this could indicate a wrong data input (either by the driver or in the operation plan).
Example This can be done e.9. by informing the MBS that splitting or joining is performed via the
plan execution。
8.2
UNSAFE CONTROLACTIONS TOWARDS OPERATOR PANEL

[SDR-1]: Provide an operational rule set Which explicitly determines to Which infrastructure item
3
completed (safety related) intervention referslreferred to.
Rationale Since safety functions of MBS directly depend on the correctness of its operational state;
special care has to be taken Where a human operator is allowed to issue safety related commands
Or settings。
>
[SDR-2]: When changes to the operational state are reported by personnel,
the operator shall
always check x they are already entered in the operation state of MBS, even x the operator believes
this has already been done in the past
Rationale as above。
二>
[SDR-3]: The operator panel shall provide easily accessible information on all currently manually
entered infrastructure state With the required confidence for a safety related function。
Rationale The operator shall have a means to reproduce origin and the reliability of the presented
data.
二>
[SDR-4]: The interface for the operator shall allow to pre-schedule usage restriction areas。
Rationale In order to avoid secondary (possibly non-SIL systems) tools;
Or
even pen
&
paper
solutions the system shall include safe and transparent means for pre-scheduling.
二>
[SDR-5]: The operator shift handover shall include either an operational process or digital means
that prevent a loss of (safety related) information during the handover。
Guidance Ideally all relevant information as Well as the handover- procedure itself are foreseen in
the operator panellsystem。
Example Whenever the operator confirms a (safety related) request from any other stakeholder, this
confirmation shall contain a token (e.9., safety code) either from MBS or a trustworthy operator panel,
guaranteeing that the said intervention is either already in place or dependably pre-scheduled.
>
[SDR-6]: The operator panel should implement procedures to verify the entered usage restriction
data, before the entered data is passed to the MBS system。

Rationale Since the operator is still a human being, additional procedures to verify the inputs are
recommended。
[SDR-T]: Entering usage restriction areas shall take priority over the regular management of
running trains
Rationale E.g., a usage restriction that was issued to late is a safety risk。
Guidance Maybe an even more general prioritization of tasks could be implemented. The life-cycle
of URAs > is a design decision potentially influencing multiple systems。
[SDR-8]: The operator shall always Verify with the construction team on site that the work has
actually been completed before removing the corresponding usage restriction area。
Rationale Again, possibly safety related information fromlthrough human beings needs to be re-
checked by adequate processes and rules。
二>
[SDR-9]: The operator panel shall be designed to support the operator with contextual information
when executing operator commands. L.e. the operator shall be able to select the stopping position
based on an interface with information about the physical elementsltrackside assets and select a
stopping position based on the physical elements position。
Rationale With processes that have a
human in the loop'
also the feedback to this human
e.9.,
its readability and its correctness
may have safety implications。
>
[SDR-10]: The operator shall receive a (visual) indication about the reported train position age.
(e.9., information outdated longer than for a defined threshold should be indicated).
Rationale Edge cases that result from timing interrelation (e.9., max. GSM-R signal roundtrip) in the
greater system need to be
at least
visible to the operator。
8.3
UNSAFE CONTROL ACTIONS TOWARDS TRACKSIDE ASSESTS CONTROL &
SUPERVISION
Those UCAs are either covered with measures defined in the EULYNX specification or are directly
linked to moving trains
and thus covered by UCAs towards the onboard unit (8.1.)

8.4
UNSAFE CONTROL ACTIONS REGARDING DOMAIN DATA & UPDATES

[SDR-25] DR shall include a set of verification functions that ensure that processed data follows
the required engineering rules and is not malformed.
Rationale as with [SDR 191.
[SDR-19] There shall be a "safety responsible'
entity Which is in a valid position to verify the
correctness (correspondence to the physical reality) of the input data for
MBS with
3
certainty
corresponding to a SIL-4 function.
Rationale With the concept of a "generic" Safety Logic the functional behavior of MBS depends on
the correctness (conformity with physical reality) of its input topography- and configuration data (here
Domain Data) from an external source。
Guidance This is a nonnegligible advantage over past and current approaches (see Figure 9).
For
example;
MBS allows for much greater flexibility with regards to setting MAs instead of relying on
pre-defined routes。
However, since MBS cannot verify that correspondence to physical reality by
itself, an exported requirement demanding
as Well as a clear path of responsibility shall be
established

[SDR-20] MBS shall include a function that ensures that the input data (here Domain Data)
received corresponds exactly to What has been verified and validated by the above (in UCA-DR-)
mentioned safety responsible (e.9. by means of a dedicated signature or safety code)
Rationale If there are intermediaries between the entity that Validated the input data for MBS and
MBS itself, then a
method is required to assure that the data has not been alteredlchanged in
between.

二>
[SDR-21] An operational rule may be required, that ensures that any infrastructure changes have
to be preceded by a (sufficiently large & restrictive) URA, and that this URA may only be lifted if the
changes have been updated in the topography & configuration data of MBS。
Rationale MBS lacks the information to verify that the
URAs
are
sufficiently restrictive for the
infrastructure change to be safely performed. This verification must therefore be performed by other
means, e.g.an
operational rule。
二>
[SDR-22] There shall be a "safety responsible" entity Which is in a Valid position to define
3
(sufficiently large & restrictive) URA Which covers the area in said AoC Which is about to change
during the upcoming data (Domain Data) update. Again, with a certainty corresponding to a SIL-4
function。
Rationale Similar to the correctness of topography and configuration for normal operations; i is
paramount that the URA covering the area that is about to change during an update (of Domain
Data) is sufficiently large and correct。
Alternative MBS could have a capability that allows to derive the delta between the current and the
uploaded newlnext Domain data update. However, a separate (and safe) concept on how to derive
3
sufficiently large URA would be required.

SAFETY RESULTS & CONCLUSION
9.1
STRUCTURE OF THE RESULTS
The results of this document are presented in three separate chapters:
Chapter 6 "Interface Criticality" contains the analysis of the safety relevance of the interfaces
connected directly to the MBS。
The neighbouring system is specified in the name of the interface
(e.9.:
DRis the interface between the MBS and the DR).An analysis with respect to the correctness
and integrity of the data as well as the availability of the connection was also conducted for each
interface. The following interface are listed as safety related:
AS,
OBU,LOP,
TACS.
Chapter 7 "Mapping of X2Rail Safety Analysis " covers the safety analysis results [X2RAIL-5] of the
project X2RAIL to
ensure that they are adequately considered in this analysis。
This is done by
analyzing each hazard from the X2Rail results and by providing a trace to different artefacts of the
STPA analysis。
It can be stated that the X2RAIL results
Where applicable (not bound to a S2R
specific solution)
are fully covered by the artifacts (e.9. assumptions, design recommendations;
interface analysis,
.) from this task。
Chapter 8 "Compiled Design Recommendations " contains the results of the risk analysis in Chapter
5 above, supplemented with rationale; guidance & example statements Where applicable. Although
these enriched recommendations should be self-explanatory, it makes sense to look up the linked
unsafe control actions in the chapters above. They describe how such a hypothetical scenario could
have occurred and form the background for the recommendations.
9.2
STARTING POINT
The basis for this analysis was the rough system architecture that is baked into the grant agreement
as Well as Various sources from previous projects (see chapter 3). However, essential inputs from
System pillar were not available at the time. Thus, an own list of assumptions (see chapter 5.5) was
created, compared, mapped, and supplemented with a similar list from the system definition task
(13.1. Similarly, the operational context
Was rather compiled and derived from state-of-the-art
procedures in the participating railway companies than given from the normative side. Another factor
shaping the work in this task, were the resources at hand, and the parallelized work structure given
through the grant agreement。

The first part of the original objectives stated in the grant agreement "analysis of the impact of the
system pillar inputs" was not feasible due to a lack of the inputs regarding the concepts and the
operational context But the missing inputs were substituted from other sources as stated in 9.2. The
results of this task can conversely serve as input for the ongoing discussion in the system pillar。
Due to limited time and resources, the authors decided to focus on system hazards, by analyzing
the control interactions between the moving block system and the systems with Which it interfaces
directly. The chosen method is explained and exemplified in chapter 5.
We expect that the results can be utilized to update the system concepts, the system definition as
Wellas the
operational context and then further the system specification for the continuing innovation
pillar work on the Moving Block Demonstrator. Some of the results can also be exported adjacent
work packages, like WP27 where the Digital Register is being specified, or to the demonstrator work
packages WP44145 where operational concepts, and an operator consolelworkbench will come into
play.
Even though a
of completeness with respect to functional safety is not in part of this task, we
were able to show that We cover the Whole set of results from X2Rail safety work in chapter 7.
9.4
DISCUSSION OF MAIN RESULTS
An advantage of the
Chosen approach
Was that it allowed to
connect the beforehand stated
assumptions With the relevant loss scenarios they affect. Some of the used assumptions were well
established (e.9., the SIL classification of the OBU, OCs), While others were relatively novel (e.9.,

Suropes Rail
not requiring
TTDs for detection
of train presence).
The safety analysis therefore provided an
opportunity to validate or
i necessary
these assumptions。
For example,
under the assumption that TTDs
are
not required ([ASM-4]),
we generated loss
scenarios for the relevant unsafe control actions to see if the hazard could still be prevented. This is
closely connected to two further assumptions about MBS:
1.
Up to date knowledge of all (potential) train positions on the tracks
2.
Ability to constrain all train movement within a known area (i.e.
movement authority)
The respective set of loss scenarios (concerning runaway wagons, loss of communication, parking
vehicles and so on) led to the specific design recommendations [SDR-13], [SDR-16] & [SDR-18].
The summary of those in turn leads to the conclusion, that the assumption that TTDs can completely
be eliminated While still guarding against all loss scenarios found in our analysis is too strong. In
Short,
讦
uncontrolled
train
movement
cannot
be
eliminated,
their presence
is
still required。
Henceforth, [ASM-4] was updated to [ASM-4-v2]
MBS does not require TTDs for controlled train
movement but supports them for migration purposes or systems Where the chance of uncontrolled
movement cannot be sufficiently controlled by other means.
A second class of assumptions is concerned with the correspondence between reported data and
physical reality. This includes assumptions about the reported train length ([ASM-8]) as Well as the
geographical position of infrastructure elements like points, tracks, etc . ([ASM-26]). For train length,
partial validation is possible in the case of splitting or joining trains. However, the validation alone
may not be sufficient to achieve the desired level of confidence required for a SIL 4 function (e.9., x
two trains enter the same TTD section and maneuvers like joining, splitting, or turning take place)
Thus [SDR-11] states that
MBS shall always be aware When a change of train length is expected
(i.e. due to splitting and joining).
The correctness of information on the geographical position of infrastructure elements is even more
critical for MBS. Some controller constraints depend on geometrical information (e.9. ensuring that
there are no intersections between movement authorities; [Resp-MBS-1]) which need the required
level of precision to ensure that
no intersections
are undetected. MBS lacks the information to
Validate
the provided information
by itself,
but depends
on
计
for
SIL-4 functions。
Thus, the
corresponding assumption [ASM-2G] has the rank of exported requirement, provided in a higher level
of granularity through the design recommendations [SDR-18] to [SDR-24].
The third class of results concerns the control loops Where a human actor is involved . Several design
recommendations in section 8.4 concern the Operator Panel; its ability to display safety related
information;
to re-verify human entered values; to schedule safety related commands;
Or
more
general operational procedures that could be linked to respective loss scenarios in our analysis。
9.5
OPEN POINTS AND FUTURE WoRK
Even though the major pain points were likely highlighted in this analysis, they are not yet verifiably
settled or solved。 In that regard,
the design recommendations will have to be considered in the
system definitions of MBS, DR and the Operator Panel
to be then re-checkedlvalidated in a further

step ofthe safety analysis (e.9., protection against side-on collisions; domain data safety responsible
entity)。
Some of the assumptions defined at the beginning of the work packages simplified the analysis and
might have to be re-opened in a later stage When extending the system scope (e.9., SIL of train
length
train integrity information; handover to neighboring MBS- or legacy systems) Finally, there
are some use-cases that were postponed to a later stage of the demonstrator (e.9., supervised
shunting) that must be analyzed as soon as first concept drafts are available。
The results of the safety analysis review from 013.1 will be further developed and addressed within
WPI4. Regarding any form of proof of completeness, e.9., for a later certification will likely have to
move to a possible second phase of the R2DATO project
