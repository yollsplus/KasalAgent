Preface
鼍
The purpose of a Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) investigation is to
improve railway safety by preventing future railway accidents or by mitigating their
consequences。
Itis not the purpose of such an investigation to establish blame or
liability. Accordingly, it is inappropriate that RAIB reports should be used to assign
fault or blame; or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting
process has been undertaken for that purpose.
RAIB's findings are based on its own evaluation of the evidence that was available at
the time of the investigation and are intended to explain What happened, and whyin a
fairand unbiased manner。
Where RAIB has described a factor as being linked to cause and the term is
unqualified, this means that RAIB has satisfied itself that the evidence supports both
the presence of the factor and its direct relevance to the causation of the accident or
incident that is being investigated. However, Where RAIB is less confident about the
existence of a factor or its role in the causation of the accident or incident;
RAIB will
qualify its findings by use of words such as 'probable' or 'possible' , as appropriate。
Where there is more than one potential explanation RAIB may describe one factor as
being 'more' or 'less' likely than the other。
In some cases factors are described as 'underlying' . Such factors are also relevant
to the causation of the accident or incident but are associated with the underlying
management arrangements or organisational issues (such as working culture).
Where necessary; words such as 'probable' or 'possible'can also be used to qualify
'underlying factor'
Use of the word 'probable'
means that, although it is considered highly likely that the
factor applied, some small element of uncertainty remains. Use of the word 'possible'
means that, although there is some evidence that supports this factor, there remains a
more significant degree of uncertainty.
An 'observation' is a safety issue discovered as part of the investigation that is not
considered to be causal or underlying to the accident or incident being investigated,
but does deserve scrutiny because of a perceived potential for safety learning.
The above terms are intended to assist readers' interpretation of the report, and to
provide suitable explanations where uncertainty remains. The report should therefore
be interpreted as the view of RAIB, expressed with the sole purpose of improving
railway safety。
information about casualties is based on figures provided to RAIB from various
SOUrCeS.
Considerations of personal privacy may mean that not all of the actual
effects of the event are recorded in the report: RAIB recognises that sudden
unexpected events can have both short- and long-term consequences for the physical
andlor mental health of people who were involved, both directly and indirectly; in what
happened.
RAIB's investigation (including its scope; methods, conclusions and recommendations)
is independent of any inquest or fatal accident inquiry, and all other investigations,
including those carried out by the safety authority, police or railway industry。

Summary

At about 22:44 hrs on Monday 23 March 2020, the 21:05 Cardiff Central to
Birmingham New Street service collided with a class 66 locomotive that had derailed
at the end of a siding, south of Bromsgrove station. The passenger train suffered
significant damage along one side of all three vehicles, although it did not derail. There
were four passengers and two crew on board the passenger train and none reported
any injuries。
The locomotive had just arrived in the siding and was to act as a 'banking' locomotive;
assisting heavy freight trains up the
1in 37
Lickey incline, to the north of Bromsgrove
station. It derailed after running through the buffer stop at the end of the siding and
came to rest
fouling the main line. The driver of the locomotive was not injured in the
collision, although the locomotive suffered damage to the corner of the leading cab。
The driver did not stop the locomotive before it reached the buffer stop because he
became distracted from the driving task by personal issues arising from the national
COVID-19 lockdown announced earlier that evening.
The collision occurred because there was insufficient time between the locomotive
derailment and the passenger train's arrival for the alarm to be raised and the
passenger train to be stopped。
RAIB has made one recommendation to Network Rail to review its processes and
standards for managing buffer stop collision risk on non-platform terminal tracks。
RAIB has also identified three learning points for drivers, relating to compliance with
mobile phone policies in the driving cab , informing signallers of accidents and safe exit
from trains during an incident.

3
At about 22:44 hrs on
Monday 23 March 2020,
a locomotive collided with the
buffer stop at the end of a siding about 700 metres south of Bromsgrove station。
The locomotive derailed and came to a stop foul of the adjacent main line. Less
than a minute later, a northbound passenger train collided with the corner of the
locomotive, but did not derail. The passenger train came to a stop between the
locomotive and Bromsgrove station。
4
No-one was hurt
5
The passenger train suffered extensive damage to one side of all three vehicles。
The front left corner of the leading vehicle was particularly damaged in the area
of the driver's door. The locomotive suffered damage to the front left corner of the
leading cab. There was also damage to the underside of the locomotive and this
resulted in a diesel fuel spill during recovery (figure 1).
The buffer
and the associated track at the end of the siding, was also
damaged during the collision.

At this location, the maximum permitted speed on the up Gloucester main line is
90 mph (144 kmlh). The maximum permitted speed on the up Bromsgrove neck
siding is 15 mph (24 kmlh). The siding and main line are on a downhill gradient of
1in 283 and a gentle right-hand curve, in the direction of travel of the locomotive.
The signalling in the area is controlled from the Bromsgrove workstation Which
is located at the West Midlands Signalling Centre. Although the line from
Birmingham as far as Bromsgrove station is electrified, the location of the
accident is beyond the end of the electrified area。

Trains involved
The locomotive
岂
14
The diesel locomotive that derailed, 66057,
Was
ofa small sub-fleet of class
66 locomotives that had been modified to undertake banking duties on the Lickey
incline.
A
banking locomotive is moved against; and sometimes coupled to, the
rear of trains requiring assistance, in Bromsgrove station (paragraph 7), before
helping to provide power up the incline. If the banking locomotive has coupled
to the train, a remote coupler release is operated , disconnecting it on the move;
when the train has reached the
of the incline。
The train then continues, and
the banking locomotive returns down the incline to Bromsgrove; ready for further
duties.
15
On the night of the accident the locomotive was due to bank its first freight train
from Bromsgrove at around midnight。
The passengertrain
16
The passenger train was a three-car class 170 'Turbostar' diesel multiple unit;
number 170107. CrossCountry reported that there were 4 passengers on board at
the time, including an off-duty DB Cargo driver, as well as two train crew。
17
It was operating service 1M87 ,1 the 21:05 hrs train from Cardiff Central to
Birmingham New Street. The train had left Worcestershire Parkway station about
12 minutes before reaching Bromsgrove
and Was
running about 2 minutes late。
Its next scheduled stop was at Birmingham New Street。
Railequipmentlsystemsinvolveg
18
The buffer stop consisted of a metal framework that was fixed to the jointed rails。
It did not contain any sliding friction elements or hydraulic buffers. It was fitted
With two permanently illuminated red lights (figure 4)
19
The buffer stop was installed in its current location (figure 5) around 2004,as
identified from historic satellite imagery. Prior to this, the siding had ended in a
buffer stop located about 90 metres further south.
Staff involved
20
The driver of the locomotive had worked on the railway for 18 years, with
14 of those driving for DB Cargo and its predecessors。
He held the relevant
competencies for driving class 66 locomotives and his route knowledge for the
route to Bromsgrove Was up-to-date.
He regularly worked this shift, operating the
banking locomotive to and from Bromsgrove.
DB Cargo stated that there were no
significant safety-related incidents on the driver's record.
21
The driver of the passenger train had been driving trains for 44 years。
CrossCountry reported that there were no significant safety-related incidents on
his record.
An alphanumeric code, known as the 'train reporting number'
is allocated to every train operating on Network Rail
infrastructure

Externalcircumstances
22
It Was dark at the time of the accident. The weather Was clearand
with

temperatures of between 2%C and 4%C recorded at local weather stations。
23
There Was very little local illumination and no significant sources of noise nearby.
岂
24
It is possible that if the accident had occurred during the hours of daylight, the
driver might have seen the locomotive slightly earlier, and been able to reduce the
collision speed a little. However, there is no evidence to suggest that any other
external circumstances affected the accident.

The sequence Of events

Events preceding the accident
9
25
The locomotive driver had last worked on the previous Saturday; two days before
the accident. He worked the night shift, getting home at around 08:30 hrs on the

Sunday morning, and rested until about midday. He spent the rest of the
at
home, going to bed at around 23:30 hrs。
26
He woke at about 08:00 hrs on the Monday morning and did not try to sleep
during the
27
At 20:30 hrs, the driver watched the Prime Minister make a statement on
television relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. This was the statement which
instructed people to stay at home, except for limited , predefined reasons, and that
no-one Was allowed to meet with friends or family unless
lived in the same
household . Immediately after watching this broadcast, the locomotive driver set
Off to work, which was a 2O-minute drive away。
28
While en-route to work, the driver received a phone call from a family
memberand there was a worried discussion about What the earlier televised
announcement would mean for his childcare arrangements。
29
The driver arrived at Bescot yard, near Walsall, and booked on punctually, by
telephone;
at 21.11 hrs。
He prepared the locomotive and departed at 21:32 hrs.
Although this departure was 27 minutes behind the published schedule; the
timetable for the journey was such that it was possible to recover this time before
Bromsgrove。
The locomotive travelled via the Sutton Park line before being
stopped for a few minutes at a red signal at Castle Bromwich curve.At 22:07 hrs,
after the signal cleared, the driver took the locomotive towards Bromsgrove via St
Andrews Junction and Kings Norton.
30
After passing Kings Norton, over a period of 11 minutes, the driver received three
text messages on his personal mobile phone. These were from the same family
member as the earlier phone call and all related to concerns about childcare
and the closure of schools.
The driver sent four text message replies to these. At
22:38 hrs he received a picture message showing advice from the school relating
to school provision, and he sent a text reply. Table
1and figure 6 show details
of these timings and the approximate locations at which the messages were
received.

31
The locomotive passed signal BA3611at 22:39:51 hrs at 38 mph (61 kmlh),and
Was routed from the down Gloucester line to the up Gloucester and then onto the
up Bromsgrove loop through the station (figure 3). The train was only two minutes
behind schedule arriving in the station.
32
The driver slowed the locomotive for the approach to signal BA7623, at the south
end of the platforms in Bromsgrove station.
This signal is approach controlled,
meaning that it was held at red for a fixed length of time as the train approached
i, before it cleared to a proceed aspect. This feature is intended to ensure that
the speed of approaching trains is reduced, because of a speed restriction on
the route beyond the signal. The signal is also fitted with the Train Protection and
Warning System (TPWS) which will automatically stop any train passing it at red。
At 22:42:01 hrs, When signal 8A7623 cleared to a proceed aspect, with a route
set for the up Bromsgrove neck, the driver released the brake and applied a low
power demand。
The train passed the signal at 6 mph (10 kmlh).
33
After passing the signal, the driver's thoughts returned to the picture message
that he had received at 22:38 hrs (paragraph 30). At 22:42:43 hrs, while travelling
at 18 mph (29 kmlh), he shut Off the power, returning the controller to neutral.At
this point the locomotive was travelling at less than the maximum permitted speed
0f 30 mph (48 kmlh) for the first 350 metres towards the up Bromsgrove neck,
although this limit subsequently reduced to 15 mph (24 kmlh) for the last 350
metres along the siding itself。
Events during the accident
34
The locomotive coasted for 52 seconds towards and into the up Bromsgrove
neck. The locomotive's speed gradually increased on the
1in 283 downhill
gradient from 18 mph (29 kmlh) to 23 mph (37 kmlh).
35
At 22:43:35 hrs, and with the locomotive 40 metres from the buffer stop, the driver
became aware of where he was and made an immediate, full
application of the
locomotive's brakes. Four seconds later, the locomotive collided with the buffer
stop at approximately 21 mph (34 kmlh).

The locomotive tore the buffer stop off the end of the siding, pushing it for about
20 metres before coming to a stop. The locomotive ran Off the end of the track,
詈
ploughing into the ballast, with only the last two sets of wheels remaining on the
台
track.As it ran on,
unguided by the track, the locomotive deviated to the left,
coming to a stop with its front left corner about 600 mm away from the nearest
running rail of the up Gloucester main line (figure 1).

37
The locomotive driver got out of the left side of the cab to investigate the
consequences of the collision. He soon became aware of the sound and lights
岂
ofan approaching passenger train, and realised that he Was on an open running
line.
He immediately ran towards the back of the locomotive to get clear of the
open line.
38
The passenger train, 1M87, was travelling at 85 mph (137 kmlh) when it collided
With the corner of the locomotive at 22:44:26 hrs, approximately 47 seconds after
the locomotive had collided with the buffer stop.
Events following the accident
39
The driver of the passenger train immediately applied the emergency brake;
coming to a stop just south of Bromsgrove station. He reported the collision to the
signaller, Who blocked all the lines to trains.
40
Network Rail reported the accident to RAIB at 23:21 hrs。
41
The few passengers on 1M87 were evacuated on foot to Bromsgrove station at
23:55 hrs. The train Was moved to the station at 03:00 hrs on 24 March, ready for
recovery to Tyseley depot that afternoon.
42
The locomotive was rerailed by 16:00 hrs on 24 March, and left in the siding to
await recovery to Toton depot
43
Network Rail undertook remedial work to remove
Ofthe buffer stop that
remained foul of the up Gloucester line
Work was also undertaken to clear up the
diesel spillage that occurred during recovery of the locomotive. The up and down
Gloucester lines were reopened to trains at 00:04 hrs on 25 March 2020.
The Up
Bromsgrove neck remained out of use for several days until track repairs were
completed.

parts

Analysis
鬟
Identification of the immediate cause
44
The locomotive became foul of the main line shortly before the passenger
Servicearrived。
45
When the locomotive hit the buffer stop, it continued for approximately 20 metres
and deviated to the left before coming to a stop. This caused it to foul the up
Gloucester line; Which was open to traffic (paragraph 36). The passenger train
arrived less than a minute later, and collided with the corner of the locomotive
(paragraph 38).
Identification of causal factors
46
The accident occurred due to a combination of the following causal factors:
The locomotive derailed to a position foul of the main line (paragraph 47).
There was no opportunity to stop the passenger train before the collision
(paragraph 72).
Each of these factors is now considered in turn。
DerailmentOf fhe locomotive
47
The locomotive derailed to a position foul of the main line。
48
This causal factor arose due to a combination of the
following:
The driver was distracted from the driving task as the locomotive entered the
siding, resulting in the collision with the buffer stop (paragraph 49).
The locomotive deviated to the left after collision with the buffer stop
(paragraph 58).
Each of these factors is now considered in turn.
Driver distraction
49
The driver Was distracted from the driving task as the locomotive entered
the siding, resulting in the collision with the buffer stop。
50
When the driver started work on 23 March, he had just seen the Prime
Minister's announcement of the COVID-19 lockdown (paragraph 27).
He had
also had a telephone discussion with a family member about the impact of the
announcement on childcare arrangements (paragraph 28). These arrangements
had relied on support from other family members Which would be prohibited
under lockdown.
It Was clear to him that this would make it very difficult for him to
continue to manage his shift working pattern.

51
The driver stated that it Was his normal routine to
his personal mobile phone
on silent and in his
prior to his driving turns, but on this occasion, he forgot

to do so and it remained, on silent and vibrate, in his pocket. As a result, he Was
alerted to receipt of the messages from the family member and he read and
replied to them while driving (table 1). The final message he received included
advice from his childrens' school that further complicated the childcare issue, and
the driver also replied to this. This final incoming message occurred about four
minutes before the locomotive passed the signal at Bromsgrove station and five
minutes before the collision With the buffer stop。
52
The driver's use of his personal mobile phone was contrary to the DB Cargo
'Mobile Phone Policy' 
Which states:
'Personal mobile telephones must not be used Whilst in the driving cab, oron or
about the running line .
53
The driver was aware of his employer's policy. However, the fact that the mobile
phone was vibrating in his pocket; combined with the significant, unresolved
childcare issue, drew him to read and respond to the mobile phone messages
While he was driving the locomotive.
54
When the locomotive passed the signal at Bromsgrove station, the driver applied
a little
power to enter the siding, before removing it and coasting (paragraph 34)
At this point, his thoughts returned to the last message relating to the school, as
the childcare problem was still occupying his mind. He sent no further messages;
but continued to worry about how the childcare issue could be resolved, while the
locomotive coasted along the siding towards the buffer stop。
The result of this Was
that he was temporarily distracted from the driving task while in the siding. It was
only when the locomotive was about 40 metres away from the buffer stop that
the driver became aware of his location and immediately made a full
application
Of the locomotive's brakes. However, it was too late to avoid a collision with the
buffer stop.
55
Although the driver had been awake for approximately 13 hours before starting
his shift, there is no evidence to suggest that he Was particularly tired at the time
ofthe accident. His time awake would have affected his level of fatigue laterin
the shift;? and RAIB notes that this does not align With good practice in fatigue
management. However, RAIB does not consider that fatigue contributed to the
cause ofthe drivers distraction on this occasion.
56
DB Cargo's 'Fatigue Management Policy' places responsibility on the employee
for reporting fatigue issues, either before or during a shift. DB Cargo also stated
that non-fatigue related 'fitness for duty' issues, such as those involving personal
circumstances, Use the same
reporting method。
This policy states that:
'AlIemployees have a duty to report if they feel the onset of fatigue at the
commencement or at any point during their shift, to the Control Duty Manager:
2 RAIB has examined first night shift fatigue in its investigation into an uncontrolled freight train run back at Shap
RAlBreport 15/2011). This also featured in a safety digest into
buffer stop collision at London King's Cross

bag;

57
At the time of signing on, Which was done remotely by telephone and not

face-to-face, the driver did not consider that he was fatigued, nor did he consider
that this was an issue
during the journey to Bromsgrove. He also did not consider
that the emerging childcare issues would affect his ability to drive during his shift。
As a result, he saw no need to report anything under the fatigue management
reporting system either before, or during, his shift。
DevationOf the locomotive lo fheleft
58
The locomotive deviated to the left after collision with the buffer stop。
59
The locomotive hit the buffer stop at 21 mph (34 kmlh); which was 40% above
the maximum permitted speed in the up Bromsgrove neck. The result was that
the locomotive detached the buffer stop from the end of the siding and pushed
its structure ahead of it. The locomotive ran Off the end of the rails and ploughed
through the ground ahead of it, causing the ballast to pile up.
This caused the
locomotive to Slow to a stop.
It would also have influenced the direction in Which
the locomotive travelled, with this effect being largely random. In this accident, it
caused the locomotive to deviate towards the up Gloucester line.
60
The speed of the locomotive as it hit the buffer stop Was sufficient for it to travel
far enough to become foul of the up Gloucester line before stopping. If the
locomotive had not exceeded the maximum permitted speed for the siding, it
Would almost certainly not have travelled far enough to foul the main line.
Standards related to the bufferstop
61
When the buffer stop was installed in its current location around 2004, the
relevant standard for managing buffer stop risks Was railway group standard GCI
RT5033 issue one (Terminal Tracks
Managing the Risk' ). This states that:
'Alength of straight track, greater than the length of the longest vehicle
permitted to use the track, shall be provided wherever reasonably practicable at
the approach to the buffer
so that any vehicle striking the buffer stop will
do So With its longitudinal axis at right angles to the buffer beam。
62
Although there was a very gradual curve to the main line and the parallel siding,
this Was of such a large radius that the locomotive would have still struck the
buffer stop square on, in line with the intent of this requirement。
63
GC/RT5033 also defined circumstances in Which an overrun risk assessment Was
required to be carried out for a buffer stop. This stated:
The risks of harm to people and damage to critical structures arising from a train
overrun at the
following locations shall be assessed:
terminalor
platforms
terminal tracks on freight lines and sidings used by trains carrying dangerous
goods
Where there are significant identified risks to persons or property beyond the
railway boundary。
Report 14/2020

November 2020
Bromsgrove
Stop,
bay

64
Because the up Bromsgrove neck was not at a station platform, Was not used
by trains carrying dangerous goods and posed no significant risk to those

outside the railway boundary; there was no requirement to undertake a specific
overrun risk assessment under this standard . However; there would have still
been a
requirement for the buffer stop installation to have a more general risk
assessment as required by the general duties associated with the Health and
Safety at Work etc Act 1974.
65
Network Rail was unable to locate any records from installation of the buffer stop
in its current location (paragraph 19) to indicate that an overrun risk assessment
was carried out, nor any findings of more general risk assessments. Bromsgrove
station was remodelled in 2016, but no changes were made to the buffer stop at
that time.
66
However, a number of mitigations, of the types suggested in standards relating to
overrun risk assessment, were present at the up Bromsgrove neck. These were:
Two permanently lit red lights were fitted to the buffer stop, to aid visibility by
any approaching trains。
Imposition ofa 15 mph (24 kmlh) maximum permitted speed, to manage the
impact energy in any collision with the buffer stop.
Normal stopping position for locomotives was more than 50 metres short of the
buffer stop, managing the risk of trains coming into contact with it。
Use of an approach-controlled signal on entry to the siding, managing the speed
oftrains entering i.
The Train Protection and Warning system (TPWS) was fitted at this signal. This
would have the effect of stopping any trains that pass it at danger, well before
reach the buffer stop.
67
The buffer stop Was not subject to any specific maintenance regime; as
defined by Network Rail standard NR/LZITRKIO01 module 18 'Inspection and
Maintenance of Permanent
Buffer Stops' .
Network Rail did not consider
the up Bromsgrove neck to be a 'terminal track on a freight line' , and so a
specific buffer stop inspection regime was not required by the standard. However,
Network Rail did expect routine visual inspections of the track to identify any
significant defects with the buffer stop and to flag these for attention. There is no
evidence to suggest that there was any defect With the buffer stop at the time of
the collision.
68
The red lights on the buffer stop were subject to regular inspection by Network
Rails Distribution and Plant team
This included replacement of the lamps every
Six months。
Records show that this was being carried out. In addition, CCTV
from a passing train shows that the buffer stop lighting was illuminated four hours
before the accident (figure 7), indicating that it was almost certainly lit at the time
of the accident。

69
The current guidance on risk assessment for buffer stops is described in
GIGN5633 (paragraph 84). Although intended for platform tracks, the risk
assessment methodology can be applied to non-platform lines. It considers
features such as the layout of the terminal track, its collision history; physical
condition and any surrounding infrastructure and population. The output of the
assessment is an estimation of the fatality and injury risk, expressed as 'estimated
years per fatality' =
70
Although GIGN5633 does not define any action levels relating to this calculated
risk, its identically titled predecessor standard , GCRC5633, indicated a first action
level of approximately 3,300 years per equivalent fatality。
71
RAIB retrospectively applied the methodology of GIGN5633 to the up Bromsgrove
neck, taking into account the mitigations present and the possibility ofa
passenger train on the adjacent up Gloucester line. This indicated a risk ofone
fatality every 135,000 years, considerably less than the threshold for action
suggested by the earlier standard。
Note that the term 'fatality' includes statistically weighted injuries, in line with railway industry standard practice。

OperationOf the passengertrain
72
There Was no
opportunity to stop the passenger train before the collision。

73
The passenger train, 1M87,
WaS
running on clear signals at around 85 mph
(136 kmlh) on the approach to Bromsgrove. There Was no possibility that the
driver of the train could have stopped the train before the collision, even ifhe had
applied the brakes on sighting the locomotive's lights in the dark. Furthermore;
seeing the lights of a locomotive on the adjacent up Bromsgrove neck Would not
have been a reason for the driver to brake; because locomotives regularly wait
in the siding.
The driver had no idea that the locomotive was foul of his line until
his train collided with i. However, as his train approached, he became aware of
a cloud of dust that had been thrown into the air during the derailment, but he did
not have time to apply the brakes before the collision.
74
The passenger train driver did not receive any warning of the derailed locomotive
prior to reaching the collision site. Such a warning could have come from the
signaller, i
had been alerted to the derailment by a GSM-R4 call from the
locomotive driver. Alternatively; the locomotive driver could have sent a Railway
Emergency Group Call (REC), Which sends a 'stop all trains' message to all
trains in the vicinity. However, the locomotive driver did not contact the signaller
immediately after the derailment, nor did he initiate a REC。
75
The passenger train arrived approximately 47 seconds after the locomotive
collided with the buffer stop (paragraph 38). The locomotive came to a stop about
four seconds after it hit the buffer stop.
A cloud of ballast dust was thrown into
the air; affecting the driver's visibility of the surroundings. The driver would then
have taken a few seconds to recognise What had happened, having only become
aware of the buffer stop four seconds before colliding With it (paragraph 35).
76
The locomotive driver's first action after the collision with the buffer stop Was to
out of the locomotive to investigate Whether it had derailed. He would have
found this difficult to judge from the cab due to the dust cloud. Exiting the cab on
a class 66 locomotive involves moving behind the driver's seat and opening a
door into a short corridor The external door then needs to be opened before the
driver can climb down to ground level. This would probably have taken the driver
about 20 seconds to complete. It is likely that the driver would only have reached
the track about 20 seconds before the arrival of the passenger train. Therefore;
he did not have time to give any warning to the signaller or to initiate a REC。
The
driver only had time to run to the back of the locomotive to get clear of the up
Gloucester line onto Which he had alighted, and on Which the passenger train Was
approaching.

77
Module M1 of the railway Rule Book (GERT8OOO-MI 'Dealing with a train

accident or train evacuation' ) states that in the event of a train accident, the driver
should take the following actions:
You must immediately switch on the hazard warning indication Where
provided。
Ifyou cannot do this, you must display a red light forward。
You must then check:
讦any other lines are obstructed (i in doubt; treat them as obstructed), and
decide the quickest way to stop any approaching trains
the exact location of your train.
You must tell the signaller about the accident in the quickest way possible and
whether the electric traction current needs to be switched
78
The driver was in a state of shock and confusion having just collided with
the buffer stop. He has stated that he did not consider the possibility that the
locomotive was foul of the main line at this time. Therefore, he did not recognise
that he needed to switch the hazard lights on. Had he switched them on, the
approaching passenger train would not have seen them until a few seconds
before the collision. It is possible that this would have caused the passenger train
driver to apply the brakes. However, although this might have reduced the speed
of the train before the collision, i would not have prevented i。
79
For the same reasons, the locomotive driver did not turn on the red tail lamps in
the leading cab, nor Sshow any other red light through the cab window. However;
had he done so, again, it would have been unlikely to have had any effect on the
actions of the passenger train driver because locomotives can often be seen to be
waiting in the up Bromsgrove neck。
80
The driver's actions in checking What had happened to his locomotive before
contacting the signaller were consistent with the wording of the Rule Book. RSSBs
has since reported that an amendment to the Rule Book Will come into force in
December 2020 which will require the driver to inform the signaller of an accident
before checking if any other lines are affected.
81
The
GSM-R Handbook' (RSSB document RS523) describes the operation and
functions of the GSM-R radio system fitted in trains and available to signallers and
operations controllers. Section 5.3 describes the use of the REC in an emergency
Situation. It states:
AREC can be used during any emergency situation affecting more than one
line or more than one train。
In an emergency situation the driver may need to initiate a REC:
The railway Rule Book is maintained and published by RSSB on behalf of its members. RSSB is a not-for-profit
body Whose members are the companies making up the railway industry, and is registered as Rail Safety and
Standards Board Ltd, but trades as RSSB.

82
Although it associates possible use of the REC with emergency situations, the
handbook does not provide detailed guidance on what situations the REC should

be used for and those for which it should not. Because a REC sends a 'STOP
EMERGENCY' message to all trains in the relevant area, there Will be situations
Where a REC is appropriate and others Where stopping all trains is not necessary。
DB Cargo stated that its training in the use of the REC uses scenarios to test the
responses Of drivers to emergency situations and the appropriate use of the REC.
However, it also stated that there is no definitive list of situations Where REC
use is required and the decision is largely down to driver discretion based on the
circumstances at the time. The locomotive driver did not initially consider that his
locomotive could be affecting the adjacent line and so did not consider using a
REC.
Observation
Buffer Stopriskassessment
83
The standards and processes that Network Rail applies to assess the risk of
overrun at buffer stops do not address those on non-platform tracks.
84
Network Rail standard NRIL2ITRK/2102 issue 8 (Design and construction of
track) requires the use of GCIRT5033 (paragraph 61) for the design of new or
renewed buffer stops. GC/RT5033 has since been superseded by rail industry
standard RIS-7016-INS 'Interface between station platforms, track, trains and
buffer stops' 
This includes the requirements for overrun risk assessment of buffer
stops. Associated guidance on how to undertake buffer stop risk assessments is
described in rail
industry guidance note GIGN5633 'Recommendations for the risk
assessment of buffer stops and end impact walls' .
85
RIS-7016-INS states that its purpose is to set out 'requirements for the design
and maintenance of station platforms for their safe interface with track, trains and
buffer stops'
Therefore; sidings that are not in station platforms, such as the up
Bromsgrove neck, are not covered by it. The associated guidance in GIGN5633 is
linked to RIS-7016-INS and so is also limited to platform tracks.
86
RAIB observes that although earlier standards had some applicability to non-
passenger terminal tracks, the current standards do not. Therefore, there is no
current requirement or guidance to specifically risk assess the overrun risk at
buffer stops that are not located in station platforms。
Previous occurrences ofa similar character
87
RAIB has investigated a number of buffer stop collisions. Examples of these
are Sudbury
RAlB report 26/200@), Chester (RAlBreport 26/2014) and King's
Cross
RAlreport 15/2016). RAIB has also published a safety digest into a
second buffer stop collision at King's Cross (Safety digest 15/2017). However;
the circumstances of this accident differ from those featured in previous
investigations, and as a result none of the previously made recommendations are
directly relevant here。

Summary of conclusions

9
Immediate cause
88
The locomotive became foul of the main line shortly before the passenger service

arrived (paragraph 44).
Causal factors
89
The causal factors were:
a
The locomotive derailed to a position foul of the main line (paragraph 47).
This causal factor arose due to a combination of the
following:
The driver was distracted from the driving task as the locomotive entered
the siding, resulting in the collision with the buffer stop (paragraph 49,
Learning point 1
j The locomotive deviated to the left after collision With the buffer stop
(paragraph 58, No Recommendation).
b
There was no opportunity to stop the passenger train before the collision
(paragraph 72, Learning points 2 and 3)
Additional observation
90
Although not linked to the accident on 23 March 2020,
RAIB observes that:
a
The standards and processes that Network Rail applies to assess the risk
of overrun at buffer stops do not address those on non-platform tracks

Recommendation and learning points
`
Recommendation
量
91
The following recommendation is made:6
岳
The intent of this recommendation is to improve the management of
overrun risk at buffer stops that are not located in station platforms。
Network Rail should review, and revise xf necessary; the processes and
|
standards that it applies to buffer stops installed on non-platform terminal
tracks, to ensure that the risks arising from potential buffer stop collisions
are being adequately managed (paragraph 90).
This recommendation may also be applicable to other infrastructure
operators。
Learning points
92
This accident demonstrates the importance of:7
train drivers complying with their employer's mobile phone usage policy
So as to avoid unnecessary distractions while driving.
2
informing the signaller following a train accident; even before it is
confirmed that adjacent lines are obstructed.
3
train drivers, and other staff, intending to get out of their trains following
an incident ensuring that
do soin a manner that does not place
them at unnecessary risk from trains on lines that are open to traffic.
Those identified in the recommendation have
general and ongoing obligation to comply with health and safety
legislation, and need to take these recommendations into account in ensuring the safety of their employees and
others。
Additionally; for the purposes of regulation 12(1) of the Railways (Accident Investigation and Reporting) Regulations
2005, this recommendation is addressed to the Office of Rail and Road to enable it to carry
its duties under
regulation 12(2) to:
(a) ensure that recommendations are duly considered and where
appropriate acted upon; and
(b) report back to RAIB details of any implementation measures, or the reasons Why no implementation
measures are
being taken。
Copies of both the regulations and the accompanying guidance notes (paragraphs 200 to 203) can be found on
RAIB's website LgoyLklrajk
'Learning points
are intended to disseminate safety learning that is not covered by a recommendation. They are
included in
report when RAIB wishes to reinforce the importance of compliance with existing safety arrangements
(where RAIB has not identified management issues that justify a recommendation) and the consequences of failing
to do so. They also record good practice and actions already taken by industry bodies that may have a wider
application。
