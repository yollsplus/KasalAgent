SUMMARY
A serious accident occurred at 20:41 hours on 24 July 2013,at PK 84+413 of line 082 from Coto da
Torre branch (Ourense) to
A
Grandeira branch (A Corufa); kilometre point 85.0,
near
Santiago de
Compostela station (A Corufa)。
This Was due to derailment of all vehicles of long-distance passenger
train 150/151, belonging to Renfe Operadora. This had come from Madrid-Chamartin and was bound
for Ferrol:
The
entire trainset
Was
derailed causing catastrophic personal injuries
and
material damage。
There were 80 fatalities and many seriously injured。
Conclusion: The cause of the accident Was excessive
Of the train (travelling at 179 kmlh) on
the curve
leading in to A Grandeira branch (the Angrois curve, speed limit 80 kmlh). The driver Was in
breach of the requirements of the timetable of train 150/151 and of the Table of Maximum Speeds for
line 082.
As a
contributory cause, i is noted that that the driver's attention was reduced when he answered a
service telephone call on the train from the train manager, Which caused him not to brake sufficiently
to reduce speed before entering that curve。
Recommendatjons:
Finaladdressee
Number
Recommendation
Make 计
a rule that all speed reductions; from a

deceleration onwards, must be marked at the trackside
by fixed speed limit signs。
For

(significant
speed
reductions),
arrange to set up balises progressively Which may help to
control the speed of trains, So that

13 vehicles。 It Was coming from Madrid-Chamartin and bound for Ferrol (A Corufia). After making
scheduled stop at Ourense station with changeover Of driver; i continued on its route via line 082
(known as the Ourense
Santiago line). It departed from Ourense with a four minute delay。
The train covered the first 78 km Of the line at an approximate speed of 200 kmlh. The ASFA Digital
system Was Working. AIl signals on its path indicated `track clear。
About 6000m (PK 78+280) before the start Of the
curve leading to the
A
Grandeira branch (at
PK 84+228, Where speed of travel is restricted to 80 km/h); the driver answered
a service call from the
train manager (guard) on the corporate mobile telephone:
The trainset continued along track 1 and passed caution signal E
7 (PK 80+619) of the A Grandeira
branch. After noting that the signal was indicating `track clear' to proceed on the main track, and at
a
speed close to 200 kmlh, the driver continued the telephone call with the train manager。
This
probably distracted his attention; and he did not start braking in time to adjust to the prescribed
speed for the radius 402 m curve located from PK 84+228.

The derailment began (point 0) at the end of the first transition. The cant on the curve
is 130 mm. Maximum permitted speed is 80 km/h according to the current Maximum Speed Table:
The elevated stretch from PK 79+630 to PK 84+261 has a

a 364 m
length of ramp begins, with an incline Of 8.600, with the appropriate vertical transition; and this is
Where the derailment occurred. The ramp ends at PK 84+625.
Some special features of the area are as follows:

Controland Signallinqsystems
Line 082, Coto da Torre branch
A Grandeira branch, km point 85.0, has a block via trackside signal
(BSL). The central traffic control (CTC), managed from the Adif Regulation and Control Centre (CRC)
at the high-speed control post of Madrid's Atocha station does not cover either branches (Coto da
Torre or
A
Grandeira). These, with the adjacent Ourense and Santiago de Compostela stations, are
managed from the Ourense control post when
are under central control. Nevertheless, both are
operable
under local control;
when operations
are
carried
out from
Ourense
and Santiago
de
Compostela statjons respectively。
The line has level
1 ERTMS/ETCS. In the direction of travel of the train (from Ourense to Santiago); this
covers from PK 1+845 to PK 80+069. In the opposite direction, ERTMS is established from PK 84+200 to
PK 7+206. Asa
back-up, ASFA is installed throughout the route。
The point of the derailment (PK 84+413) is near the end of the line, at the A Grandeira branch. This is
already beyond the stretch fitted with ERTMS. Hence at this point traffic is managed from the central
control post at Ourense or, failing this, from Santiago de Compostela station When under local control。
So there are three electronic interlocking limits laid out on the Ourense-Santiago section, Which govern
operations on this line. In the train's direction of travel, the Ourense electronic interlocking system
applies from the start of that station to PK 1+845 (the point where the ERTMS towards Santiago
commences).

INVESTIGZTION COMISSION
The beginning of the derailment (PK 84+413) is located within the Zone managed by the Santiago de
Compostela electronic interlocking system. This interlocking system covers the A Grandeira and Rio Sar
branches and Santiago station itself, all of which, as commented, are controlled from Ourense control
post; When in central control mode, or from Santiago de Compostela station when in local control
mode。
More specifically, the derailment occurred in the A
Grandeira branch;
a subsection controlled by the
Santiago de Compostela interlocking system. Access to the branch via track 1of line 082, in the direction
Of the derailment (from Ourense to Santiago) is protected by entry signal E7 (PK 84+176) which, in turn;
is announced by caution signal E' 7 (PK 80+619).
E7is atall signal with three lights (green, yellow and red). It is on the right side in the direction of travel。
It has a fixed board showing 50 (50 kmlh for a diverging line; Which is not the case) and
a luminous
direction display. It has balises beforehand (PK 83+876) and at the signal (PK 84+171). Its position is at
the exit from the Santiago tunnel (no 31) and i is clearly visible。
E'7 is 3 tall signal with three lights (of which only two are operative: green and yellow). It is on the
right-hand side in the direction of travel. It has a fixed board showing 60 (60 kmlh for a diverging line;
Which is not the case) and a luminous direction indicator. It has a balise beforehand (PK 80+319) but
not at the signal (not necessary)。
It is located
a little before the entrance to the Marrozos tunnel
(no 30) and is clearly visible。
Associated With this signal (E'7), three boards have been set up nearby, at PKs 80+086,80+278 and
80+398, located at catenary posts。
Other signs using existing boards in the area before the point of derailment; and in the direction of
travel, are as follows:
Board indicating change of ASFA mode (PK 80+803).
This is
on the right, inside tunnel
no 30 (Marrozos)
It marks the point Where i is necessary to change from
ASFA
high
to ASFA
conventional mode
Board marking the start of the RGC area (PK 84+176), located at the same post as signal
E7. It shows that near here falls within the scope of RGC (the General Traffic Regulation).
Fixed speed reduction sign (PK 84+273), on the right-hand side at 3 catenary post, and
close to the point of derailment (402
爪
curve)。
It marks the
100 metres
where the
maximum speed permissible for the infrastructure changes, as prescribed by the Maximum
Speed Table。
Below there is another board showing the depressurisation of the train, for
the comfort of the passengers。
Entries to tunnels and

To communicate outside the train on line 082, Coto da Torre branch
A Grandeira branch, km point 85.0,
GSM-R is available (mobile telephony with
a band reserved for the railway). This operates between the
train and the Madrid-Atocha control post。
On the Ways in to Ourense and Santiago de Compostela, from line
there is the track-train
radiotelephony system, Which links the train with the Ourense control post。
To communicate inside the train, there is internal telephony for the driver to communicate with the

2.2.5. Actiyatongf be@ilwaycontingency  n
According to the information supplied by the Ministry of Developments Emergencies and Crisis Coordination
and Management Unit; by Renfe Operadora and by Adif, the sequence of actions Was as follows:
24luy2013
After the accident at 20:42 hours, the driver of train 150/151 reported What had happened via GSM-R
from the driving desk (in the head power car) to CRC Atocha。
From this time on, the emergency
protocols of Renfe Operadora and Adif, and the coordination procedures between them, came into
action in order to implement the measures envisaged
a5
necessary in support Of the emergency。
Pursuant to these; CRC Atocha reported What had happened to 112, to the 24h Network Management
Centre (CGR24) and to the Adif control post at Ourense。
At 20:45 hours Adif CGR24 informed the Adif control post in Leon and the Renfe Operadora Operations
and Civil Defence Centre (CECOM):
After
a chain of communications, Renfe Operadora convened its
crisis cell and activated the emergency protocol. The cell for assistance with communication media Was
set up for 24 hours. Adif, in turn, launched its contingency plan。
In addition to tracks
1 and 2 of line 082 (Ourense-Santiago), which the accident blocked, the Ourense
control post decided to suspend traffic on the tracks of the conventional network in the area, to allow
risk-free action by people and equipment:
At 21:20 hours Renfe Operadora and Adif began to establish an alternative transport plan to minimise;
as far as possible, the consequences of the severing of lines for trains Which were already travelling on
them, or were scheduled to do SO.

CASUALTIES (DEAD AND INJURED) AND MATERIAL DAMAGE
2.3.1. Csyalties (deadandiniured)
According to the information supplied by Renfe Operadora, 221 tickets for Santiago de Compostela, or
stations beyond, Were sold for train 150/151. These tickets were for persons older than four years old

Ourense-Santiago route included
a
Safety officer, the Off-duty driver who had driven the train on the
Medina del Campo-Ourense route, tWo people working in the cafeteria, the train manager and the

To establish the number of fatalities, the Traffic Safety Regulation for the Public Railway Network, as
amended by Royal Decree 918/2010, Of 16 July 2010, in line with the criterion of the European Safety
Directive, defines a fatality as any person Who dies

The speed reduction is before [is made before] and everyone does it where he considers it appropriate。
Personally, he takes the caution signal [E '刁, about 4 km before, as the reference point for braking.
He Was going at around 180-190 km/h when the accident occurred。
He cannot explain Why he did not reduce speed。
km is covered very quickly at 200 km/h。
The signal Was at green。

There Was nothing on the track or in the vehicle Which hindered him and might have been the
cause Of this accident happening.
He Was running on ASFA in high-speed mode with BSL [ trackside signal blocking].
The public prosecutor asked: could this [referring to ASFA] rather than something else have influenced
the course of the accident or its very occurrence?. The driver replied:
'The thing is, i all depends on me having to know that; at this point; I must adjust to this speed。
Theres nothing else to i。

Puentedeume, he called to ask if he could enter on the bypass track at that station. His reply Was
affirmative: that the train could g0 on either track。
He had not referred to written material to answer the train manager's question. The only written
material he had in front of him
Was the train logbook, and he had not consulted any Written
material:
He did not know when
had called him. It had been during the arrival at Santiago。
He had no idea of the place where he had been on the route at the moment when the telephone
call had been made。
It Was clear that he was going to crash and he realised this at a distance, on seeing the curve. He
knew he applied both brakes: electric and pneumatic。
The electric brake is the motor brake and the pneumatic brake is applied to the brake shoes。
Normally, for smoother braking, you brake with the electric brake and, if You need to brake a bit
more, you apply the pneumatic brake a little。
But if YOU need to brake much more; YoU put both
brakes fullon。
He has been on many journeys with this train manager, and he does the same routes that the
train manager may go on
One
he ends up with one, and another
with somebody else。
He believes the train manager has done this route as much as he has, and he does i very often。
Answers to the public prosecutor's questions
He has both the ATO system [a control for pre-setting speeds], which is a button, and the electric
brakelpower handle. In mid-position, the handle is at zero. Move i backwards, that is the electric
brake; move i forwards, that is the power regulator。
Asked by the public prosecutor if he had to keep both hands constantly occupied, he answered:
he can keep his hands completely free. If he is driving on the pre-set speed system, he can keep
both hands free. The only thing he cannot let go is the dead man。
He positions the corporate telephone in front of him [on the driving console]. He leaves the train
logbook on a clip Which holds i and the jpad on
a kind Of screen Which is not working, and he
keeps it `enlarged so he can see it better, without having to peer。
Questioned by the public prosecutor about the reason for the train manager's call, and whether entry
on one track or another Was up to him or to the control he answered:
The train manager
WaS
asking him [the driven] whether the train would fit on the tracks at the
station, because he [the driven
Was aware Of this information. And then the train manager; given
this information, would call the management centre [at Renfe Operadora] to ask them to switch to
one track oranother。

After that; the operations centre [Adif Would call him to let him know which track to enter
although there Was
no need to say this to
a5
could tell him via the signals, by switching
them to green-yellow。
Asked by the public prosecutor if it was the train manager's job to speak to control to position the train
on one track or another; he answered:
What the train manager says is the number of passengers, Whether there is any passenger with
reduced mobility, who cannot cross via the platform. If so, he requests a change of track, etc。
Asked by the public prosecutor if the call to discuss this matter had to last nearly two minutes, and
Why the train manager did not make the call on arrival at Santiago, When the train Was stopped, he
replied that:
He had told the train manager that the train would fit perfectly at either platform, and the
train manager had insisted。
He Was bound to answer when the telephone rang, because the train might be on fire。
At that moment he did not see the danger。 He did not realise the point of reference [to start
braking], because he did not see i。
He thought t
Was not near and that he
was going quite
relaxed, at the right speed Which posed
几0
danger. He did not know e the call had been an
influence, ornot。
The public prosecutor asked him: 'Did you hang up before seeing the signal?' He answered:
When Ibraked Ihad already switched Off the telephone.'
He had missed the location of the caution signal, because he oriented himself from the signal
[caution signal E'7, from the caution sign boards。
He never saw them [the E'7 sign boards]. He did not know Why he had not seen them. [The sign
boards before caution signal E'7 were his point of reference to start braking and reduce Speed
from 200 km/h to 80 kmth].

He Works for Renfe Operadora。
His job is to check passengers getting on and Off the train. He checks the passengers' tickets。
He considers i worth reporting all incidents occurring on the train to the driver, as the driver is in

Otherwise;, where coverage exists, communication is by mobile

always uses the telephone first, since this is the quicker system。
He called the driver to tell him
he

passenger building. The driver confirmed to him that i would fit perfectly。
He had never ordered the driver to enter the track of that section, because this was impossible。
The call must have been before the accident. When the accident happened, his telephone
WaS

He could not remember at What point he had made the call. He had called because telephone
coverage existed at the time. Between Ourense and Santiago, there Was full coverage over the
Whole route, but coverage Was poor from Santiago to A Corufa.

The second call was to confirm that he could lock the doors [ operations completed].
As for the reason Why he had made the third call, he explained that he had made i to find out
Whether the train could be positioned
on track 2,
Which is the closest track to the passenger
building at Puentedeume station. Normally, at Puentedeume,
enter on the main track and, on
that track; passengers alighting from the train have to go to the end or beginning of the platform
and cross the tracks, because there are crossings between the platforms, and g0 to the passenger
building to get out on to the road Which leads to the village of Puentedeume.
The family getting Off at Puentedeume had not said anything to him. He had taken the initiative, in
order to improve the service and convenience for the passengers。
He had already made such a call several times。
He always made calls of this type in similar situations。 On some trains
can make them, on
others You cannot [he means technically].
He does this if there are passengers. He always does t for passenger convenience.
Asked by the public prosecutor:
did this conversation [the third], to tell him about the track yoU
wanted, have to last one minute 42 seconds?

SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
The European Directive on safety
on the Community's railways (2004/49/EC)
WaS
transposed into
Spanish law by Royal Decree 810/2007, of 22 June 2007, which approved the Traffic Safety Regulation
Of the
National Public Rail Network。
Annex
V
Of the
Directive prescribes the principal content of
accident and incident investigation reports. Paragraph 3.2 of this refers specifically to the traffic Safety
Management Systems (traffic SMS) of the companies involved in each accident。
The Safety
Management Systems (SMS) in force at Adif and
Renfe Operadora
Were analysed in
accordance with this Directive。 This analysis took place in three stages. The first two describe the
contents of the traffic Safety Management Systems of both companies (Adif and Renfe Operadora). A
third deals with their specific application to this accident。
3.2.1. SMSOf teifrastryctwre mamager:Alif
3.2.1.1
Structureand content
The company Chairman formally approved the SMS on
6 April 2OI0.
It first states that Article 9 Of
Royal Decree 810/2007 requires that
'the Rail Infrastructure Manager (Adif) shall establish a Safety
Management System Which shall guarantee, within the scope of its duties, that the rail system at least
meets the Safety targets and standards and is adapted to the Safety requirements prescribed in the
technical specifications for interoperability (TSIs) and technical specifications for approval, and that the
relevant parts of the safety methods (SM) are applied:
Based on this, i proved necessary to adapt the traffic SMS, in force at Adif since August 2006, to the
neW
requirements specified in Royal Decree 810/2007.
The text quoted states the requirements and presentation format which Adifs traffic SMS must meet. It
goes on to specify that it must guarantee control of all the risks posed by its own activity as manager of
the infrastructure and of the railway undertakings Which operate on it including maintenance services;
supply of equipment and deployment of contractors。
In order to adapt Adif's traffic SMS to the above requirements of the Royal Decree, the document with
three titles listed below has been drawn up:

This contains a description of the allocation of responsibilities Within the Adif organisation. It explains
how safety management
is controlled
at the various levels,
how  staff and
their representatives
participate in the Various Safety bodies, and how continuous improvement of the Safety Management
System is assured。
It is structured into five chapters, the contents of which are as follows:

According to Adif Safety Directorate Notice
dated 9 December 2011, the route between Coto da
Torre branch and
A Grandeira branch km point 85.0 (i.e. line 082, Where the accident occurred) falls
within the regulatory scope of the Technical Operating Requirements for Traffic and Safety (PTO)。
The end sections at Ourense and Santiago de Compostela
are
governed by the General Traffic
Regulation.
Thus, in accordance with PTO Article 106, the `train logbook' informs the driver about the requirements
relating to the running of the train, temporary speed limits and the composition and braking of the
train. It also contains all other information Which has to be passed to the driver. This logbook is unique
to each train and day of operation。
Nevertheless, the running of the train is covered by a document with
a
longer term of validity, called
the train timetable

section; the kilometre point (PK) locating the stations and other important points on the line, the
maximum speed Which this train can reach in practice on each section, points Where i must halt (for
scheduling
Or technical reasons); length of stop, the times at Which i has to pass these identified
points (stations etc. ) and the number of the radio channel which the driver must tune in to in the cab
to communicate with the relevant control post。
There is another document. While it is not mandatory to have it in the cab, it complements the other:
the
Maximum
Speed
Table。
This
includes the
maximum speeds per
route
(not
per train), the
permanent speed limits per track section, and other information。
Ihetrain logbock shows that braking availability Was 200%, although 155% Was necessary, and that the
train Was type 240 B (maximum speed for the type Of rolling stock Was 240 kmlh; without considering
other restrictions)。
On that day (24 July)
a
temporary speed limit Of 200 kmlh Was in place, only on
track 1
This had been imposed since 25 June 2012, between PK 77.6 and PK 80.1 of that line (082).
There were no other recorded limits or restrictions。
The_tin_tmetable (boek)forAlviatain 150LI5L reflects that i had to stop for 10 minutes at
Ourense station。
It Was scheduled to depart from there at 20:01 hours and arrive at Santiago de
Compostela station at 20:41 hours, Where i Was to
for tWo minutes。
Still  according to
the timetable, at the beginning
Of line
082 the
maximum permitted speed is
110 km/h between Coto da Torre branch and PK 2+903.
Between that point and
PK 84+230, the
maximum speed at Which this train could travel (dictated by its own rolling stock) Was 220 kmlh. This
point marked the beginning of the Angrois bend (the place of the accident), where the timetable
Shows a change of speed. This is limited to 80 km/h until the end of line 082 (A Grandeira branch km
point 85.0). It then continued (on another line: 822) with another change of speed to 75 kmlh as far
aS
Santiago de Compostela station。
Between Ourense and Coto da Torre branch, the timetable indicates that ASFA is in operation With
communication by radiotelephone (track-train: channel 62). Throughout line 082, i.e. between Coto da
Torre branch and PK 85.0 (A Grandeira branch), the timetable states that ERTMS/ETCS level 1 applies
with
ASFA (as back-up)。
Communication
is
Via
GSM-R.
However, in reality; the
ERTMS ends at
PK 80+069, as stated in previous sections。
Between
PK
85.0
and
Santiago  station, apparently
only
ASFA
is
aVailable
with
radiotelephony
(track-train: channel 64)
IheMeximym Speed Table for line 082, `odd' direction (Ourense to Santiago de Compostela), indicates
that the maximum
for the stretch is 110 km/h from the beginning to PK 2+903. From there to
PK 6+094, maximum speed is limited to 235 km/h. From there to PK 84+230 (start of the Angrois bend
and place of the accident); the maximum speed rises to 300 km/h, but is reduced to 80 on the next
section to A Grandeira km point 85.0 (end of the line). The information given in the last paragraph also
applies to the Maximum Speed Table (ERTMS appears up to PK 85 but really only reaches PK 80+069).

IspectionsDYAdf
Adif's Traffic Safety Directorate sets a number of in-cab inspections Of traffic safety during journeys in
each region. These are specified in the Annual Traffic Safety Plan (PASC).
Procedure SGSC/ICC entails inspection in the cab of conditions of travel during journeys. The purpose
is
to check, from
the
drivers cab, compliance
with
the regulations for driving
Staff and crew,
maintenance of the railway infrastructure and facilities necessary for operation, safety devices and
appliances in service, fitness to run, and the deployment of the necessary staff。
Since line 082 was commissioned in December 2011, Adif has carried out eight in-cab inspections between
Ourense and Santiago de Compostela: five in 2012 and three in 2013. One of these took place on
150/151 train service (Class 730).
Another detected the only defect (repeated defects of the inspected
rolling stock). In all these cases, the drivers behaviour Was correct and professional. In no
CaSe
Were
defects of infrastructure or other incidents detected.

Renfe Operadora establishes an annual programme of accompanied train journeys;
35
Of the
Annual Action Programme of the Annual Safety Plan. I sets 3 minimum number of checks of this type
to carry out. For this purpose it provides Procedure SMS-PE-PCIA-OI: Accompanied Train Journeys。
The aims of these checks are as follows:
to check compliance with the regulations in force;
to detect incorrect or incomplete practices by driving staff;
to check correct fitting of safety devices on power cars;
during the accompanied journey; to observe the condition of the infrastructure and signalling
equipment Which may affect traffic Safety;
to observe staff behaviour and psychological and physical conditions Which may affect them;
and
to check the ergonomics of the vehicle and installations。
The
methods of inspection
include checking train safety
Hence Procedure
SMS-PEPCIA-04
governs management of safety recorder content。
Thus personnel of Renfe Operadora's Leon Regional Delegation of the Traffic Safety Directorate and
Of North Galicia Passenger Market Management were accompanied
on journeys and their records
Were
analysed. In the period from
10 December 2011
to
24 July 2013,
on the Ourense-Santiago
route, a total Of 16 safety logs were analysed (equivalent to 1411 km).
92 medium-distance train
journeys were accompanied (equivalent to 8 114 km), and another 35 long-distance (equivalent to
3 087 km).
According to certificates produced by these two departments, the inspections accomplished during the

The Renfe Operadora Safety Management System includes the General Defect Management Procedure
(SMS-PG-I6), Which deals with defects forwarded by operating staff; on PAIs, as one of the channels
Of communication of defects. The other channels i lists are: inspections; rolling stock defect

developed. This makes i possible to e-mail the PAI to various addressees (not only the next in line).
Accordingly, CIAF investigators reviewed the PAIs in both paper and electronic format; originating from
the North
West Management and collected by the Leon Regional Delegation of the Traffic Safety
Directorate。
also reviewed reports made by other personnel and forwarded to that centre by
other means (memoranda, e-mails, telephone calls etc).
They reviewed 3 total of 21 reports, 4 of which were by PAI, for the Whole Of 2011. They reviewed 16
from 2012, Of which 8
Were
PAIs. Up to 24 July 2013 (the date of the accident), there had been
17 reports, 10 of them by PAI。
The review carried out detected no incident at all relating to line 082 and therefore to the context of
the accident。
Thus Annex 3.2.3.3.5 contains a document from the Leon Regional Delegation of the Traffic Safety
Directorate certifying that the PAIs contain no mention of any incident on the section of track Where
the derailment occurred, or on the 10 km leading to 比

Other considerations
Around 20 January 2014, we learned of the existence of a Renfe Operadora internal communication in
Which a Leader Driver assesses the hazard existing on the Angrois bend. The company Was then asked
for information about this.
The description of the facts, according to the documentation received, is as follows:
Mr. JMLis a middle manager and Leader Driver in the Galicia Management. He lives in Ourense。
His next in line is Mr. JP1, Who is Production Manager of Renfe's regional services in Galicia。
On 23 December ZOLL JPL e-mailed five Of his staff (all middle managers and Leader Drivers in
Galicia and driver trainers). They included JML.
He asked for data and documentation for the next

and
Catalunya, Which Was to be held on 28/12/2011.

On 26 December 2011 JML answered JPl's e-mail and copied his reply to the other colleagues。
He attached
a
report entitled
'Defects in the ERTMS/ETCS changeover from Level
1
to Level 0 and
peculiarities on the AV 082 line: ' Extracts from the comments in his report appear below:
Given the Way the changeover from ERTMS to ASFA has been arranged, 讦 the driver does not
reduce speed to 200 km/h on his own initiative before PK 77+600, ASFA switches on (at this point) in
emergency mode:
It is therefore urgently necessary to set back the entry to ASFA (from PK 77+600,
Where i currently is
to PK 79+500, the point where the changeover from ERTMS to ASFA takes
place)
Or moVe
the
CUNVe
for reduction
of speed to 200 km/h (from
PK 79+500 to PK 77+600)
sufficiently far forward to avoid triggering the ASFA emergency if the driver does not reduce speed to
200 km/h at this time, because he has some other priority task to carry out:
'Another peculiarity of line 082 (in the 'odd' direction,
Ourense-Santiago) is a sudden change
of speed downwards, for infrastructure reasons; from 300 kmjh (200 km/h for Class 121) to 80 km/h。
There is no advance notice of this from the trackside signalling, and no ERTMS cover, since trains are
already  running
On
ASFA。
比
seems important to study
the possibility
of requesting
trackside
installation
of permanent 80 km/h speed limit signs;
Which could facilitate compliance
Wth
the
maximum speeds。
The first comment therefore describes a defect in the
changeover from ERTMS to ASFA, bound for
Santiago;
before the Angrois (or
A
Grandeira) bend。
The second is
warning that this
CUrVe
Is
dangerous。
JMI's four colleagues have made statements that
received his e-mail and did not forward i. They
gave training to middle-distance drivers; with special advice on the speed transitions for the Angrois

On 27 December 2011 JP1 e-mailed documentation for the fifth meeting of the monitoring group
for Class 121 rolling stock in operation in Galicia, Aragon and Catalunya, to be held in Madrid
On

He submitted i to three officers of Renfe Operadora Who usually attended these
meetings with him。
The points contained in that e-mail included that referred by JMl: the defect in the changeover from
ERTMS to ASFA and the warning about the Angrois bend。

Adif to impose a temporary speed limit on this section in order to adjust the braking curve to the
Signalling restrictions of the infrastructure . There is no mention in these minutes of the warning about
the Angrois bend。
JMI's first statement says:
Given that the meetings for the monitoring of Class 121 rolling stock dealt
with the topics relating to the ERTMS changeover; he [JMI] and JPI analysed the last paragraph [this
means the one referring to the A Grandeira bend, slowing from 300 to 80 km]. Given that the change
of speed was in line with the regulations in force, they decided to intensify the training of all drivers;
in the
form
of intermediate medium-distance driving assignments [JPI
corroborates this in
his
statement]. Similarly; during the accompanied runs in the cab and advice; driving Staff were
warned
about the peculiar features of the line, to boost safety.
The following is emphasised from the statements of the three Renfe Operadora officers who received
JPI's e-mail, and who usually attended these meetings: the subject of the sudden change of
on
the Angrois bend
was not dealt With at that, or any subsequent; meeting. They only dealt with train
maintenance and overhaul issues.
On 26 January 2012 the sixth meeting of the group monitoring the Class Iz2Is in operation in
Galicia, Aragon and Catalunya Was held in Madrid. Point 6 of the minutes deals with
Braking curve for

So, as far as JMIs comments
made in his document are concerned, the problem posed by the
defective changeover from ERTMS to ASFA in the Santiago-bound direction (between PKs 77 and 80)
before the Angrois bend
WaS
passed on to Adif。
The problem Was solved by setting up temporary
speed limits。
All this formed part of the business of the meetings Which
Were being held
on the
operation of the Class 121 rolling stock。
There is no record that JMI's second comment Was passed
on to Adif: his warning of the danger of the curve itself。
On the other hand, as commented in previous sections (3.2.3.3.2), the Renfe Operadora SMS does
include organs for participation in safety management。 Among these
are the six Regional Traffic
Safety Committees (CTSCs)
one for each region. One of these is Leon regional CTSC, which includes
the area Of the North East Management (including Galicia).
As i happens; JPI and his subordinate JML attended the meetings of that Regional Traffic Safety
Committee. Information about this Was requested from Renfe Operadora. JML attended 36 of the 43
meetings of that committee from 2005。
He attended all but one of the meetings held in ZOI1, 2012
and 2013 (he was absent on 15 April 2011)
To sum up, with regard to JMI's second comment; warning of the danger of the Angrois bend, at least
nine members of Renfe Operadora were in a position to know about this. It Was not dealt with either at

FUNCTIONING OF THE TECHNICAL INSTALLATIONS AND RAILWAY ROLLING STOCK
3.4.1. Control Commandand SlqmalingSystem
The context of the accident begins at signal E7 at the entry to A Grandeira branch. As stated in Notice
74 by Adif DSC, i falls within the electronic interlocking system of Santiago de Compostela, Which is
governed by Instruction Series A no 2556, Of 16 July 2012.
This interlocking system can be managed by central control from Ourense Control Post and in local
control from Santiago de Compostela station. At the time of the accident; i Was under local control。
in order to find out What indications the track signals were giving in the immediate run-up to the
accident, Adif and Renfe Operadora staff compiled an extract from the interlocking records; in the
presence of CIAF investigators。
With the cooperation of the provider of this technological installation (Dimetronic), the consistency Of
the recorded data has been checked against the sequence of events on the video footage during the
time, and within the area, of the accident。
The interlocking events have been compiled from 20:40:00 to 20:43:39 hours on 24 July 2013. Attention
is drawn to the time mismatch between the train's safety recorder (which is taken as a reference) and
the recorder of interlocking events。
This mismatch amounts to
2 minutes 32 seconds (the derailment
occurred at 20:41:06 hours on the train's safety recorder and at interlocking time 20:43:38).
Analysis of the interlocking records against the video, from which photographs are attached, proves that
the path set for train 150/151 Was, at all times; up to signal Eg at the entry to Santiago de Compostela
station on track 1
Therefore the caution signal and the entry signal (E'7 and E7 respectively) for A Grandeira branch
Were
showing
track clear' (green)。
The next signal E8,
a
caution signal for entry to Santiago de
Compostela Was showing 'stop' (yellow); While entry signal E8 at Santiago Was showing `stop' (red)。

Background
Iformationstudy
The Directorate-General of Railways of the Ministry of Development launched the Information Study
for the Project to Provide Railway Access to Galicia, Ourense
Santiago Leg in December 1999. It
considered five alternative routes, with the same solution for access to Santiago de Compostela。
This underwent the official public information procedure in November 2001.
310 written submissions
were received, and the Information Study was altered as appropriate. None of the submissions raised
objections to the route in the accident zone。
In
2002 the file Was submitted to the Ministry of the Environment for the requisite environmental
impact declaration, Which was given in March 2003.
The State Secretariat of Infrastructure at the Ministry of Development finally approved this Information
Study in April 2003. It opted to go ahead with alternative Solution C, with the modifications contained
in the public information file and in the environmental impact declaration。
Projects
By resolution Of 30 April 2002, the State Secretariat of Infrastructure at the Ministry of Development
ordered the former Railway Infrastructure Manager to draft the corresponding projects. It divided the
line into two sections (Ourense-Lalin and Lalin-Santiago) and began formalities to draw up the basic
projects in April 2003. It did not deal with access to Santiago and Ourense.
These two
basic projects served for the tendering in the competitive procedure for the design and
building of the track formation of the line. For this purpose, each of these two sections Was initially
divided into six subsections (making
a total Of 12).
These Were put out to tender in April 2003.
The
construction projects were drawn up and approved between June 2005 and April 2006.
For access to Santiago station (track formation), tenders were invited for a basic project in March 2006
and the construction project in April 2008.
For access to Ourense station (track formation), tenders
Were invited for a basic
project in August 2005 and the construction project in November 2008.
Bidding
also proceeded
for
the
construction  projects for the
track assembly
(November 2008),
electrification (July 2008)
and
installations (September 2009) for the
Whole line。
The tender
WaS
subsequently drawn up。
This line Was designed with track of the standard (UIC) gauge。
Two gauge changers were installed:
one at Ourense (on the Santiago side, at PK

and the other at Santiago de

Compostela station itself (on the A Corufia side). The aim Was to connect the line to the rest of the rail
network on the Iberian gauge.
Consideration
Was also given to installing ERTMS between these tWo gauge changers. This system
therefore extended to Santiago de Compostela station, although i only covered the new tracks laid
out。
This means that the standard gauge tracks planned between the Ourense gauge changer and that at
Santiago de Compostela station are governed by ERTMS from CRC at Madrid-Atocha, whereas the
other tracks continue to be managed via the various interlocking systems (from Ourense and Santiago)
Which incorporate ASFA。
The changeovers between the ERTMS installed
on the new
standard-gauge tracks and the
ASFA
system present on the conventional gauge tracks at Ourense and Santiago de Compostela stations
Were planned at these gauge changers, using the manoeuvres to change the gauges of the trains。
Construction_Works
The contract for the track formation works on the Ourense-Santiago leg, on the section giving access to
Santiago
de
Compostela
station,
WaS
awarded
in
July 2009。
The
Works
Were
completed
i
November 2011.
The contract for assembly of the track on the section from 0
Irixo to Santiago de Compostela
WaS
awarded in
2010 and the contract for the Works of electrification between Ourense and Santiago
(the whole line) was awarded in February 2010.
The contract for the works on the safety and communications facilities (signalling, centralised traffic
control etc ) between Ourense and Santiago was awarded in April 2010 and for the civil defence and
tunnel safety installations in April 2011.
The line commenced service in December 2O11.
Modification Of the Originalsolution
During the course of the Works, i was decided to make a modification. This Was to provide Iberian track
gauge (rather than
standard) throughout the
line。
This
ensured  continuity
Of the
Iberian gauge
throughout the Galician rail network. The originally planned gauge changers were cancelled, because two
gauge changeovers in just 90 km would seriously erode the time savings achieved by the new section. In
future; When standard gauge might be available on other; basically southward, stretches, the switch
would be made to this gauge With multi-purpose sleepers available。

The change of gauge;, from standard to Iberian, also made i possible to increase the functionality of the
new line (082). It no longer entered single track at Santiago. Instead, connection was possible With the
Eje Atlantico towards Vigo (line 824) without the need for
manoeuvres at Santiago de Compostela
station. However, the A Grandeira and Rio Sar (line 842) branches had to be available for this purpose。
Thus,
in
June 2010,
the
initially  planned
Solution
WaS
reconsidered.
A
proposal
WaS
made
in
October 2010 to modify it. The Ministry of Development authorised this in April 2011.
This decision necessitated
a
change of plan, mainly to the safety and communication installations
(ERTMS and ASFA location), track assembly (sleepers and track gear) and electrification (catenary).
As regards the signalling and control installations; given that the
neW
gauge allowed
movements
tolfrom other existing lines managed by the Santiago interlocking system, i Was arranged that this
interlocking system Would also manage the section Of this new line where i accessed Santiago de
Compostela, plus the A Grandeira and Rio Sar branches. As commented, this access section had ASFA,
not ERTMS.
It Was therefore necessary to set the new boundaries of management of the interlocking system of
Santiago de Compostela station (and the boundaries at Ourense). This would now include governance
Ofthe access sections to the new line and its interconnections with the existing tracks。
Further thought then had to be given to the locations of the changeovers between the ERTMS safety
System planned on the new line and the ASFA system on the conventional rail network. So far these
changeovers had been provided at the planned gauge changeovers. Now, the new boundaries were
set between both systems on the new build line (082).
These changeovers must comply with the Adif standard `Functional Requirements and Engineering
Rules for
ERTMS
LL
and
12.
Version
2.4.0
dated
22/10/2009'.
More specifically,
section
5.2.6
Changeover from ERTMS/ETCS Level
1 to ASFA' states that changeovers to ASFA must be announced
and arranged on the route, and always before a caution signal。
As the Santiago de Compostela interlocking system includes the bypass
A Grandeira branch (and the
Rio Sar branch), i Was then necessary to position this changeover in the Ourense
Santiago direction
before the caution signals E
7 (for track I and E' 9 (for track 2).
Both of these are located at PK
80+619. Hence, in deference to the standard, the changeover Was located at PK 80+069 (actual PK;
the PK 80+169 in the project)。
The arrangements for changeover from ASFA to ERTMS are established in section 5.2.5: `Changeover
from ASFA to ERTMS/ETCS Level 1' of the standard. It states that the order to change to level Imust be
given in
group Of fixed signal balises. Thus, in the opposite direction, Santiago
Ourense;
on the
access tracks to Santiago the changeover
Was made at signals 844 (track I and 842 (track 2), the
first signals located after the bypass Of A Grandeira branch, at PK 84+200.

required by the applicable regulations。
The same Article adds that such authorisation must be granted by the Director-General of Railways;
having seen the following documentation:
Report Of conformity of the built structures to the technical regulations applicable, issued by
the personnel responsible for their construction and supervision;
documentation received proving completed

INVESTIGZTION COMISSION
It is worth noting that this included commissioning documentation for the electrification of the 25 kV
section from Santiago to A Corutia on the Eje Atlantico, but this has no bearing on the investigation of
this accident:
The documents in that file belonged
to the various subsystems into Which the various actions
Which gave rise to completion of line 082 can be grouped。
These  subsystems
are:
Infrastructure (subdivided
into
Track
Bed
and
Track
Assembly);
Power
(subdivided into Overhead Contact Line; Substations and Remote Control), Civil Defence (referring to the
tunnel safety installations) and the Control, Command and Signalling subsystem。
In accordance with the above-mentioned regulations, each of the subsystems described was backed
by the following documents:
Reports of conformity of the built structures to the technical regulations applicable, issued by
the personnel responsible for their construction and supervision and including; beyond the
scope of the applicable regulations in each case, documents proving acceptance Of the Works;
and
Reports   proving completed
execution
Of the
test plan
issued
by
those responsible
for
executing and supervising i; including
a
description of the test method defined by Adif and
DGF.
A certificate issued by the Adif Traffic Safety Directorate, of compliance with the required traffic safety
conditions, Was also submitted。

INVESTIGZTION COMISSION
Therefore, by Resolution of 9 December 2011, DGF authorises commissioning of the works on the new
line 082 (track gauge 1668 mm) from Ourense (PK 0+000) to Santiago de Compostela (PK 88+241),
subject to the completion of certain repairs Which are not considered relevant to the investigation of
this accident。
3.4.2.2.1.
Safetyfile
Issue of the safety certificate by Adif (which is necessary for the Ministry of Development/DGF to
authorise
commissioning)
is
based,
with
reference
to
the
Command/Control
and
Signalling
subsystem (CMS), on the safety file in accordance with Adif's internal procedures。
Thus Adif has
a
procedure `certification of fulfilment of applicable traffic safety conditions by the
Command/Control and Signalling subsystem ,' which forms part of its Safety Management System.
According to that procedure, the traffic safety certificate is based on the safety file。
This file, Which
concentrates on the Command/Control and Signalling subsystem, consists of documents demonstrating
the safety of the system installed on the track。 The safety case and Independent Assessment Report
supplement this file。
Among the standards followed by these documents are CENELEC EN-50129 (and also EN-50126 and
EN-50128), conformity to
Which is mandatory under the technical specification for interoperability
(TSI) relating to the Command/Control and Signalling subsystem dated
7 November 2006.
This does
not apply to the existing subsystems and equipment。
The safety case specifically applicable to the line
Or section to be operated contains the necessary
documentation to guarantee the installations from their conception and design stage to installation,
operation
and

The
Independent
Assessment Report is carried out (by
third party unconnected with the works) on the safety case
specific to the line or section to be operated.
Specifically, on the new Qurense-Santiago line 082, the documentation making up the Safety
file divides into three parts:
A)
OURENSE-SANTIAGQ from BK1+8575OBK84+I88Ofline 082

After reviewing the documentation contained in the safety cases for the three sections into Which the
line has been divided, We can identify, as related to the accident now under investigation, that the part
relating to the completed hazard monitoring identified a series of risks Which are `exported' outside the
actual system analysed (command/control and signalling), so that complete mitigation of these risks
fell outside the scope of this hazard monitoring。
The operator is

Risks, ' the following are highlighted as related to the present accident:
The Maximum Speed Table for the line must respect the restrictions set for the infrastructure.
Risk exported to Adif。
Trains running under cover of trackside signalling
Or ASFA must comply with the Maximum
Speed Table issued for the line by Adif. Risk exported to the driver。
The driving assistance system ASFA does not provide supervision on board。
Therefore the
driver has to obey the indications displayed by the trackside signalling. Risk exported to the
driver。
Ineco, as the independent assessment body recognised by the Directorate-General of Railways, drew
up the Independent Assessment Report for this section. It also lists the first tWo risks listed above in

In the analysis carried out on safety installations of this type, risks Which cannot be assumed by the

itself
are
exported
to
other

Those
environments accept them according to the established regulations, at least as far as those relevant to

3.4.2.3
Maintenance
Rail
network
maintenance  operations
include  preventive
maintenance;
SUch
aS
inspection
and
monitoring of railway lines。
With regard to monitoring;
a distinction can be made between dynamic
monitoring, monitoring of track geometry, and other forms. Track monitoring relies on moving vehicles
Which collect readings of various parameters for further processing and analysis。
Geometric monitoring takes place using specialist vehicles and generally takes place annually. It takes
direct readings of longitudinal level, transverse level (cant), warping, track gauge, plane line alignment
etc. There are three levels of analysis: I, II and III. Basically, level I records safety parameters; level II
ride comfort; and III track fatigue via the rail (vertical, lateral and rolling contact fatigue) and track
gauge。
Dynamic monitoring can be performed
On
specialist vehicles or
on the rolling stock in service, at
operating speed。
This generally takes place quarterly and is
an indirect method of finding out the
condition of the track. It measures the accelerations to Which the vehicle is exposed in given zones; by
positioning accelerometers at strategic points。
Dynamic monitoring measures transverse (or lateral) acceleration on bogies (or wheelsets, as in this
case); Which is associated with static Or dynamic warping and misalignments With a short wavelength。
It also detects vertical acceleration on the axle
Which is associated
with short-wave levelling
defects
on each rail (welds, slipping etc:), and lateral and vertical acceleration on the Vehicle shell
(body), Which is associated with long-wave levelling defects and misalignment Which affect passenger
comfort. Finally, i detects uncompensated lateral acceleration。
In
the
accident
zone
the
last
gemetric_
monitoring
(before
the
accident)
took
place
On
21 November 2012.
The readings for all parameters Were good, except a small levelling defect (Iow
point) Which could hardly be classed `ZUT' (a zone requiring urgent attention)。
This low point Was located towards PK 84+245, at the start of the Angrois bend, and corresponded to
the transition wedge of the first pier of viaduct E-OI (in the direction of travel of the train involved in
the accident). It Was repaired in December 2012.
The lst dynamic monitoring took place on 8 May 2013. It used specialist vehicle BT-Z, Which confirmed
the good condition of the track. AIl the acceleration values measured on the Vvehicle were far from the
minimum monitoring thresholds and Wellin excess of the values for scheduled or urgent intervention.

INVESTIGZTION COMISSION
The geometric monitoring record shows (from the top down) the longitudinal level (of the left-hand
rail, axis and right-hand rail); transverse levelling (cant), warping (for 3,
5 and
9
metres); plane
alignment (curvature) (for the left-hand rail, axis and right-hand rail), lateral rail wear (left and right);
track gauge and cant again。
It is pointed out that there is a slight mismatch With the actual kilometre count, although the location
of kilometre points is feasible from external references shown on the graph (underpasses, overpasses,
signals etc)。
On
the
other hand, significant fluctuations
Were
apparent in
some
of the
measured
parameters (curvature) up to PK 85.2. These were attributable to the diverging route of the bypass track at
crossover B1-B3 at A Grandeira branch, after the Angrois bend.
The record of the dynamic monitoring shows (from the top down): lateral acceleration measured on
both Wheels on the same side; vertical acceleration measured on the axle boxes of the tWo wheels on
both sides; lateral and Vertical acceleration
on the box (of one of the coaches); and unbalanced
acceleration. The kilometre count in this case does correspond to reality. New and larger fluctuations
emerge in some of the accelerations, though they are not of significant value. They were attributed to
transit of the straight track at the existing bypasses (B1-83) at the A Grandeira branch after the Angrois
bend。
3.4.2.4
Measurement of track data
After the event, in the morning Of 25 July 2013, safety technicians from Renfe Operadora and Adif, in
the presence of CIAF members, proceeded to
measure Various track parameters in the derailment
ZOne
They measured the track from point 0 (beginning of derailment
PK 84+413) forwards for 15 m and
backwards for 35 m (normally this is only done for 15 m). They measured the values for track gauge
and cant, metre by metre. This interval also fell entirely Within the transition curve (clothoid) leading to
the 402 m circular curve (the Angrois bend).

This implies 3.33 mmlm (for speeds greater than 60 kmlh). Here; the maximum variations measured
Were

(between points +9 and +10) and 1.6 mm (between points -29 and -30), relating to the
sections before and after point 0 respectively. Hence the readings for gauge variation
Were

Eoccant the theoretical value ranged from 96.9 mm at point
35 to 119.6 mm at point 0.
Since this is
the transition zone, i increases steadily up to 130 mm on the circular curve. Standard NAV 7.3.5.0
Track qualification: cant; warping and sleeper stability sets maximum tolerances of
10 mm for the
theoretical value, for speeds below 120 km/h。
The measurement carried out at the site found Values greater than permitted on the section after point
0, Which reached -46.2 mm at point +15。
This is logical as
a result of the derailment。
On the section
before; the values range from -4.2 mm (at point -33) to -7.9 mm (at point 0). The cant values were
therefore within tolerance。
For cht Variation
Warping); the same standard permits a tolerance of 6 mm per 3 metres; for speeds
less than 120kmjh。
The measurement at the site found values greater than permitted on the 15m
section after point 0
This made sense as
a result Of the derailment。 On the section before; the cant
variation was no higher than 2.3 mm per 3 m, Which Was therefore within tolerance.
The rail cross section Was also measured at three points (84+176: signal E7; 84+230: start of curve; and
84+413: point 0). The purpose Was to check for the presence of possible fatigue. This Was a new rail (in
service since 2011), grade 60 kglm, and was found to have maintained its theoretical dimensions。
3.4.2.5
Verification
Of maximum permitted speed admissible
on Angrois bend
and
flixed signalling in the zone
plane survey Was carried out on location on the Angrois bend. This confirmed its layout parameters. After
a
straight section, the curve begins at PK 84+228.A first section Of curve represents a 200 m transition, in
the form of a clothoid where parameter A
283.8
This ends at PK 84+428, the start of the circular curve
402 min radius and 265 m in length. This ends at PK 84+693, where another transition section, similar to
the first; begins. This is 200 m in length and has a clothoid of parameter A
283.8 ending at PK 84+893,
where a straight begins。
The curve has a 130 mm cant, So that the variation in the transition zones is 0.65 mmlm. Both values
are
normal:
As there is
an 80 kmlh speed limit on
the
cUrVe,
the unbalanced
acceleration (Asc)
obtained for that speed is 0.50 mlsz below the normally established Value for type N (normal) trains,
Which is 0.65
The latter value Would be reached at a speed of 85 kmlh。
Considering the 8 mm cant deficiency found by the measurement on location in the transition zone (in
the immediate vicinity Of point 0),
the actual cant
on the
CUrVe
Would be
122 mm (theoretical:
130 mm); giving rise to
an
Unbalanced
acceleration
Of 0.54
That Value
Is
Still below the
permitted maximum (0.65 mls?)。
Nevertheless, the dynamic monitoring commented on in a previous section took place at 72 km/h While
taking the Angrois bend. It resulted in
an unbalanced acceleration Of 0.26 mlsz consistent with the

The train involved in the accident took the Angrois bend at 179 km/h. This gave rise to an unbalanced
acceleration Of 5.41 mls?
more than eight times the permitted maximum for type N trains (0.65 mls。
It is 4.5 times the permitted maximum for the type of train involved in the accident (1.2 mls?.
With regard to signalling, on the other hand, there is a series Of sign boards in the Santiago-Ourense
direction on line 082.
These run from the end of the ERTMS (PK 80+069) to point 0 (PK 84+413) of
the
derailment:
These supplement
the
coloured-light signals
E'7
(caution)
and
E7 (entry to
A
Grandeira branch). It is worth analysing the reasons and relevance of these signs。
Board marked 'changeASFAmode'a BK80+803
Notice 74 `Commissioning new lines; routes and traffic bypasses;
dated
9 December 2011, refers to
the new line 082 and other lines affected . It specifies that this signal must be set up for trains running
to and from line 082 with ASFA equipment connected. It indicates the point where the change of mode
must take place (from high-speed to conventional ASFA
as in this case
Or vice Versa)
Taking into account that the ERTMS finishes at PK 80+069 (and therefore also the high-speed back-up
ASFA), the sign board indicating the changeover is further on (at PK 80+803).
Board marked 'RGC' z PK84+176 (postOf entrysigmalEZ)
As specified in Notice 74, referred to above, this board is set up to mark the exact scope of application
of the regulations: General Traffic Regulation (RGC)
Or
Technical and Operating Requirements for
Traffic and Safety (PTOs). It must be set up near the signals delimiting the areas covered (by the RGC
OrPTO):
Notice 74 adds that the PTOs apply from Coto da Torre branch to
A
Grandeira branch (PK 85.0). That
is Why the `RGC' board is positioned at PK 84+176, to indicate that the train is about to enter this area
(from PK 85.0)
Eixed sign toreduce speed 豇 BK84+273
As PTO Article 217 states: 'change of maximum speed', this sign marks the point on the line where the
maximum speed permitted for the infrastructure changes, as per the Maximum Speed Tables。
The
kilometre point on the line is written on the inside of the sign (in orange when the change is to a lower
speed, and in blue when i is to a higher speed). This is the point from Which the new maximum speed
must be complied with。
The sign is positioned 100 metres along the line where the change of
OCCUrS:
According to the Speed Table for line 082, it is compulsory to slow to 80 kmlh at PK 84+230 (the Angrois
bend). Hence this sign is located within the corresponding IoO-metre length (at PK 84+273) and is
orange (because it marks a reduction). It is marked `84.2'.
Notice 74 appears in Annex 3.4.2.5.

3.4.3, Roling Stock
The 730.012 unit involved in the accident is the result Of a modification of the 130.012, to allow it to
run
on unelectrified
lines。
Basically, therefore, the
end
passenger coaches (Nos 2
and
12)
Were
modified, and converted into end diesel generator cars ( CET' vehicles).
CETs   incorporate
the
diesel generation plant
and
auxiliary
installations
necessary
to  operate
themselves (refrigeration, diesel fuel supply, air intake and silencer) and to supply electricity to the
motors。
To function in diesel-electric mode; Class 730 trains are equipped with a 1800 KW diesel engine and a
1600-litre diesel fuel tank which supplies 尤
There is one of these in each of the two CET cars。
Because Of the weight of the diesel generation plant; the CET car has a towed bogie at the end and
shares
a
wheelset with the adjacent coach。
Logically, both
are Of variable gauge。
The bogie Was
developed from the Class 130.
Annex 3.4.3 shows a general diagram of the Class 730 and a detail Of a CET generator car
3.4.3.1
Authorisations
The regulation governing conditions of railway rolling stock approval is
Order FOM/233/2006, of
31 January 2006.
In this case,
比 IS
supplemented by Circular Resolution 10/2008 on the validation
procedure in
cases  Of applications for authorisation
to
commission
modified rolling stock
Which
develops this aspect and makes it more specific。
Therefore; based on the above-mentioned regulations, the modified Class 730 rolling stock; like new
rolling stock, must have the mandatory authorisation of commissioning issued by the Directorate-General
Of Railways, and the relevant authorisation to run, issued by the Adif Traffic Safety Directorate, since this
is a significant modification in the terms of Circular 10/2008.
Authorisation
is  granted
for  commissioning
once
proof
has
been
given
Of
fulfilment
of
the
requirements, conditions and technical regulations applicable, and after an approval and test process。
Next; the authorisation for running certifies
the vehicle's compatibility with the infrastructure and
specifies the conditions in Which it may travel on the lines of the RFIG.
The 130.012 unit held
a
running authorisation dated 27 June 2008.
The 730.012 unit had likewise
been granted authorisation
for
commissioning
On
11 June 2012, and
authorisation for running
On
13 June 2012.
Annex 3.4.3.1 shows the documents Which constitute evidence of these authorisations。

Maintenance Plan
For the purpose of obtaining running authorisation from Adif the order referred to above also requires
approval of the appropriate maintenance plan and the maintenance centres earmarked to carry out the
operations described in that plan.
The maintenance centres in turn must hold the appropriate approval issued by the Directorate-General
Of Railways based on the company's technical competence; personnel and finances。
The appropriate Adif approval must also be held for each type of maintenance Work to
be done;
depending on the features of the railway vehicle for maintenance。
Renfe Operadora is the body responsible for maintaining the Class 730 railcar units, Which i owns. The
companies responsible for maintaining this rolling stock are Patentes Talgo, S.L., and Btren Mantenimiento
Ferroviario, S.A.(in Which Renfe and Bombardier have participating interests).
Both companies hold the relevant approvals from the Directorate-General of Railways, granted on
19 November 2008 and 29 September 2011, respectively。
Talgo and Btren jointly maintain the Class 730 units at the workshop at the Fuencarral High-Speed
Maintenance Base, 28022 Madrid . For this purpose they hold the mandatory Adif authorisation, dated
13 June 2012 and valid for five years. This allows them to carry out operation types IS, IB, IMI, IMZ,
IM3 and IM4, in increasing order of importance (see annexed table)。
The maintenance plan is structured into intervals, depending on the number of kilometres travelled in
each case. Thus, when
a
given level of servicing is carried out, 让 includes all the operations of all the
lower levels of servicing。

around 14:30 hours, before the train departed, and that there Was one axle with a brake overridden.

Adif
Instruction

25,
of

establishes。
This contains special requirements for running Class 730 and other locomotives on RFIG
lines. It allows a double rake to run with up to 12 axles with brake overridden (six for a single rake)
although there is a speed limit. This does not apply if a brake is not available on just one axle。
After the two rakes (013 and 012) Were uncoupled at Ourense; the brake tests of both were repeated。
According to the recorder for rake 013, the test took place at around 20:00 hours, before departure for
Pontevedra, and showed
that
one axle still had
a
brake overridden
Logically, this
was the
One
detected in Madrid. The recorder for rake 012 shows that the brake test Was also carried out at around
20:00 hours, and that it had brakes on all its axles。
There Was no sign of a brake overridden on any
axle.
Annex 3.4.3.5 contains the safety recorder data。
It Shows that one brake Was unavailable on
one
axle at Madrid and Ourense
3.4.3.5.2.
Brake checkj Siwy
Train  150/151, consisting of rake 730.012, carried out emergency braking
On
24 July 2013,
near
the
Angrois bend moments before the accident。
The data from the safety recorder; located on power car 045,
Which Was running in position 1
as power car, Show that this braking began by the driver operating the
service brake handle, by moving i to the emergency position (rapid braking).
According to information from Talgo (diagnosis), the figures obtained from the record of the trains
technical parameters show that, at the time the emergency brake Was applied, the train Was moving at a
pre-set speed. Therefore; When it entered a 12.590 slope, traction did not apply and the electric brake Was
applied lightly. This took place automatically, to counter the effects of the slope in order not to exceed the
pre-set speed。
On
the section
between the time 0f application of the emergency
brake (PK 84+009)
until the
derailment occurred (PK 84+413), the train's braking curve has been compared with the following two
CUrVeS:
braking
CUIVe
under the conditions
set by
the Rolling Stock
Technical Specification for
Interoperability (TSI) and the braking curve most similar to the actual curve from the tests carried out
during approval of the Class 730 rolling stock。
These tWo curves have been adjusted to the conditions under Which rake 730.012 was running on the
day of the accident. This means they have been corrected to take account of wheel diameter; train
loading and longitudinal track profile (slopelincline).
It can be deduced from this comparison that the behaviour of rake 730.012 during the emergency
braking prior to the accident matches the description for braking curves in the TSI and in the approval
of the Class 730 rolling stock. Hence the braking performance was correct。

On the other hand, based on the data gathered by the safety recorder in the power car, the Value of
deceleration produced by the emergency braking near the Angrois bend can be estimated。
It is recorded that the emergency brake was applied at 20:40:59 hours While travelling at 195 kmlh
(at PK 84+009)。
The system delayed three seconds before actually braking. Hence i Was 20:41:02,
speed  195 km/h (at PK 84+171),
when
deceleration began。 The train left the rails (point 0) at
20:41:06 (four seconds later) While moving at 179 km/h (at PK 84+413)
In the four seconds of effective braking;
distance Of 242 m
Was covered and the speed
WaS
reduced by 16 km/h.
This resulted in deceleration Of 1.11
This value; plus the equivalent three
seconds (delay in actual application of the brake); conform to the provisions of the Rolling Stock TSI
(decision 2008/232/EC; table 7,
box A). This states that; for speeds between 230 and 170 kmlh, the
minimum deceleration is 1.05 mlszand the time equivalent is three seconds。

Withdrawal of authorisation to run Class 730 rolling stock on ERTMS between
Qurense and Santiago de Compostela
To function correctly, a safety system, Whether ASFA
Or
ERTMS, must not only be correctly installed,
both on the track and in the train, but the versions must be mutually compatible。
Article 15 of Directive 2008/57
on the interoperability of the rail system
Within the Community
provides that the
Member States shall authorise the placing in service of structural subsystems,
checking the technical compatibility of these subsystems with the system into Which
are being
integrated。
With
reference
to
the
Command/Control
and   Signalling subsystem,
Spain
therefore
carries
out
integration   tests',
previously
called
'supplementary
tests'
Which
seek
to
Verify
the
technical
compatibility of the train With the network. This is not a validation either Of track equipment or Ofthe
train's on-board equipment。
Thus the complementary tests of the Class 730 units on line 082 took place to analyse the train-track
integration of the ERTMS LL.
were carried out in February 2012 on different parts of line 082.
More specifically, the tests relating to the changeover from level STM EBICAB (with ASFA functionality) to
ERTMS LI took place on track 2, towards Ourense, at the first group of balises on the Santiago side。
Commercial serice
on the new
line 082
between
Ourense and Santiago de Compostela began
On
10 December 2011. Initially the
Madrid-A Corufa link
Was still served by make-ups consisting of
a
diesel locomotive and Talgo coaches, as serving on the conventional line。
Since this rolling stock did
not have on-board ERTMS, it ran under cover of ASFA Digital.
From 16 June 2012, this rolling stock was replaced with Class 730 railcar trains. These only ran for a
week with ERTMS switched on. Then; in the early days Of service, problems were detected with the
on-board ERTMS which had not been noticed during the complementary testing in February 2012.。

The reason for these problems Was that the version 3.1.0.1 ERTMS installed on Class 730 trains made
by Bombardier had incompatibilities with the version installed on the track of line 082, made by Thales。
More specifically, one of the faults Was failure to reach the first group of balises on track 1, Ourense
side; during changeover from ASFA to ERTMS, While bound for Santiago de Compostela。
This meant
that, for one-fifth of the distance of line 082, the train Was travelling in `driver's responsibility' mode;
without the complete supervision of ERTMS and without the protection of ASFA. This had traffic Safety
implications。
That is Why, on 23 June 2012, Renfe Operadora applied to Adif for authorisation for those trains on
line 082 to return to their previous conditions of travel, i.e. with ASFA Digital. This authorisation Was
granted on 25 June 2012.
To correct the reported defects and
enable this rolling
Stock to
USe
line
082
with
ERTMS,
the
manufacturer (Bombardier) developed
a new version Of the software (version 3.1.1.2). It delivered the
documentation for this to Renfe Operadora in November 2012。
Renfe Operadora arranged to carry out
the relevant trials on the track to check that it performed properly。
The trials were carried out; with a
positive outcome, until April 2013.
Although the risk had been minimised, i
Was still possible that the balises might not be read. Hence
the manufacturer's proposed solution Was to disable another of the on-board safety systems (EBICAB-
ATP). This is being studied (March 2014)
While i is possible that the rolling stock involved in the accident might have travelled with ERTMS in
its current configuration and extent (up to PK 80+069), this system would not have limited the speed
of entry to the Angrois bend because; from that point i could travel at 200 km/h with ASFA. It Would
still have been up to the driver to reduce speed, although he would have had to press the button
recognising exit from ERTMS on the cab DMI screen. In theory, this Would have been one more factor
calling for attention during driving. IF this had not been activated, the system Would have applied the
service brake, Which would have been released at the time of pressing the button。
Annex 3.4.3.6 contains Renfe Operadora's application to run on ASFA and Adif's authorisation to do

CRC calls to ask i help has arrived. Driver replies that it has not reached him, but

Annex 3.5.2 contains the transcribed calls mentioned above, between the driver of the train involved
in the accident and CRC.
3.5.3. Requlations On communications i theca
Chapter 15 of the Operation Manual deals with communication between the driver and the control
post。
Communication
is possible
by radiotelephony (track-train)
and,
since
the
high-speed
lines
opened, by mobile telephony (GSM-R), as in the case of line 082.
As regards the use of mobile telephones by driving staff, the existing regulations consist of Notice
from the defunct RENFE, and Driver Information Sheet FIM 3, issued by Renfe Operadora。
The
notice is published to give operating staff the
necessary information about this。
It is
not
a
regulation。
Notice 102 of the Directorate of Civil Defence and Traffic Safety, of 21 April 1997, reminds staff that;
due to the
many
means of communication
i
the cab, the driver
must prioritise the
Use Of the
radiotelephone system [track-train] and keep any other personal medium of communication switched
Off。
The Technical Office for the Human Factor at Renfe Operadora Was created in 2010. Its purpose is to
study the risks Of the human factor and how to mitigate them. Most of these centre on driving. The
Office therefore studies the most common errors (real and potential) and brings them to the attention
Of those concerned (mainly drivers). It also forwards suitable recommendations on preventing them as
far as possible。
All this information can be found in the FIM leaflets, which later provided input to the
Guide to Good Driving Practice。
This literature is for information; i is
neither
a
regulation
nOr
standard。
The use of mobile telephones and other electronic devices is Widespread nowadays. They have also
been introduced to working activity
On
a
wide scale。
Hence FIM leaflet

On
Safe Use of Mobile
Telephones
While
Driving;
dated
18 July 2011,
notes
that
using
mobile
telephones
and
other
communication devices may pose a risk, and recommends using them appropriately.
The leaflet says that; from the first minute of conversation, the person becomes more involved in i
and relegates driving to second priority; not processing the information. One of the recommendations

MANMACHINE INTERFACE OF STAFF INVOLVED
3.6.1. Working howrs Of stffiyolver
According to the report from Renfe Operadora, the driver in charge of train 150/151, involved in the
accident, is attached to the base in A Corufia.
On 24 July 2013 he had begun his working day at 11:55 hours in
A
Corufia, from where he travelled
Off-duty to
Pontevedra。
At
14:42 hours he began
his
OWn
work driving
an
Alvia 252 train from
Pontevedra to its destination at Madrid-Chamartin. He drove i to Ourense; where he arrived at 16:49.
He stayed there until 20:05, when he began driving duty on the train involved in the accident。
Therefore; by the time of the accident his working
had been 8 hours 47 minutes. Actual driving
time had been 2 hours 44 minutes. He had taken the regulatory rest in the previous 48 hours。
Additional provision I1
Of Royal
Decree  2387/2004, approving
the
Rail Sector Regulation, sets
maximum continuous driving period of 6 hours, and maximum driving in one day of 9 hours。
Likewise Royal Decree 1561/1995, of 21 September 1995, on extraordinary working
establishes
3 maximum Working day Of 12 hours and a minimum period of rest of one-and-a-half days per week。
The section on rail transport establishes
maximum Of nine hours of actual ordinary working Which
may, exceptionally, be exceeded.
Collective Bargaining Agreement II of Renfe Operadora also applies。 The professional development
agreement (part on driving) deals with the working day, Which it quantifies at 8 hours. This may rise to
91/2 in specific cases。
The agreement refers to the provision of the Single Driver Regulation (the recast
text of the Renfe Labour Regulation, Article 606)。
This specifies the content on maximum continuous
driving times, Which it quantifies at 51/2 hours。
All

The Class 730 rolling stock derives from Class 130, which was designed according to the regulations in
force at the time.
Hence the technical regulations applicable to the 730 class has continued to be as
per the first interim provision Of Order FOM/233/2006 (which governs conditions for approval of
railway rolling stock)。
More specifically, NTC MA-OOI
technical requirements for conventional rolling
stock)and NTC MA-007 ( conditions for variable-gauge axles to fulfil at speeds Up to 250 km/h).
Annex 3.6.3 shows pictures Of the driving desk of a driver's cab of the 730 class. It shows parts of
the 'dead man' system, the brakes; ERTMS-ASFA Digital and communications。
This layout of the console on the Class 730 logically derives from that of the Class 130 rolling stock。
There have been very minor modifications (addition of diesel traction). The design of the Class 130
was based on the regulations existing at the time. Basically that meant UIC booklet 651 (drivers' cabs),
to Which NTC-MA-OOI refers。

SIMILAR EVENTS IN THE PAST
Ofthe accidents and incidents known to CIAF, none has occurred either on line 082 Coto da Torre branch
A Grandeira branch km point 85.0 (in service since 2011), or on the accesses to Ourense or Santiago de
Compostela Where
connect with line 082.
Nevertheless this Commission
has investigated the following accidents caused primarily by
eXCeSS
speed While passing curves on the RFIG:
Case 0029/2008.
Derailment on 5 July 2008 on the Adif conventional network of a passenger
train at Medina del Campo station (Valladolid); due to excess speed. It Was going at 151 km/h on
a
curve with a permanent speed limit of 90 km/h。
Case 0013/2009. Derailment on 23 February 2009, on the former Feve network, involving a
passenger train near the Ozanes halt (Asturias), due to excess speed. It Was going at 77 km/h round
a curve With a permanent speed limit of 40 km/h。
Case 0028/2010.- Derailment on 14 June 2010, on the former Feve network, involving a
train at Ortigueira (A Corufa), due to excess speed. It Was going at 77 kmlh round
curVe With a
permanent speed limit of 60 km/h。
Case 0038/2010.- Derailment on 14 July 2010, on the former Feve network, of a goods train at
Ribadeo (A Corufa), due to excess speed. It was going at 73 kmlh round a

speed limit of 60 kmlh, and also failed to adjust to the features Of the curve at the set maximum
speed。
Case 0006/2012. Derailment on 19 January 2012, on the former Feve network, Of a goods
train at Arriondas (Asturias), due to
eXCeSS
speed。 It
WaS
going at 70 km/h round
a
curve With
a
permanent speed limit of 40 km/h.
Case 0012/2013. Derailment on 31 January 2013, on the former Feve network involving
train at Pesues (Cantabria), due to excess speed. It Was going at 61 km/h round a
curve With a
permanent speed limit of 40 km/h
Thus this Commission has investigated six events:
one on the Adif network and five on the Feve
network. AII occurred on curves with permanent
limits, duly signalled on the track according to
the regulations. ASFA balises were not set up on any Of these, because
are not mandatory with
permanent speed limits。
The recommendations issued by CIAF to
Feve basically sought to reinforce action to
avoid risky
behaviour by driving staff。
Adif was also requested to report events (accidents and incidents) occurring on its rail network due to
excessive speed。
From 2005 until 24 July 2013, there were 20 events (14 incidents and 6 accidents) for Which the main
CaUse
Was classed as excess
speed. Only two Of these (accidents) occurred
On
curves (one
WaS On
5 July 2008 at Medina del Campo, investigated by this Commission, and the other Was the accident
reported on here; Of 24 July 2013).
Another five (four incidents and one accident) occurred in temporary
limits (due to works or the
state of the infrastructure)。
The 13 remaining (10 incidents and
3
accidents) occurred While passing
track equipment (bypasses and crossovers).
To sum
up, none Of the events investigated by this Commission
Or occurring
on the Adif network
(since 2005) have had features similar to the Santiago de Compostela derailment; i.e. exceeding the
maximum speed prescribed for the route in the Maximum Speed Table and in the timetable.

double make-up (rakes 012 and 013).
End-destination Was Ferrol (rake 12), with arrival timetabled for
22:36 hours。
It arrived at Ourense station at around 19:55 hours; where i made a scheduled halt: This was to allow
passengers to board and alight; to unhitch the two rakes of the double make-up in Which i was running,
and change drivers. Rake 012 went to Ferrol as train 150/151 and rake 013 to Pontevedra and Vigo。
At 20:02:04 hours, the driver contacted CRC Madrid-Atocha (the control post) via GSM-R to identify
himself and say he was going on duty. The call lasted 51 seconds。
Then the driver received two calls on the corporate mobile telephone; from the train manager。 One;
Which lasted 35 seconds, Was to say hello and identify the train manager。 Then the other, lasting
15 seconds, was to confirm that he could lock the doors (operations completed).
At 20:05:13 hours, the train moved Off from Ourense station. At least from 20:08:54 (start of audio
recording), the off-duty driver, relieved at Ourense, Was also in the cab. Speed increased gradually。
The Off-duty driver stayed in the cab conversing until 20:12:01 hours. Subject of discussion Was an
unresolved technical problem (of no significance to What happened). At that time, the Off-duty driver
left the cab to resolve the defect outside
At the time, the driving proceeded normally, passing balises showing `track clear ' At 20:09:29 hours
the
driver pressed the
button
on the panel to
Switch from
ASFA
Conventional
mode to
ASFA
High-Speed mode (on passing the `change ASFA mode' board). Speed of travel Was 98 km/h. Then
he passed 3 voltage changeover zone; beginning at 20:10:01, slowed from 105 to 12 kmlh (time
20:11:36), then regained speed。
At 20:15:19
an
acoustic signal sounded to press the
dead
mans switch (DM);
and
the
driver
depressed the DM
In any case, the emergency brake
Was activated through the DM at PK
8+889, With the train going at IIO km/h (first DM activation). This reduced the speed to 48 kmlh
as the train passed through
a
neutral zone between PKs 8+909 and 9+585. The driver confirmed
that this had been passed and regained speed。
At 20:17:03 the acoustic Signal sounded to press the DM.
The driver pressed the DM pedal. In any
case, the emergency brake Was again activated via DM (second DM activation) at around PK 10+857,
at a
speed of 109 km/h. This slowed to 86 km/h at 20:17:20, after Which i again increased。
At 20:17:42 the driver received
a
telephone call by corporate mobile telephone (the first call while in
motion):
This Was from the outgoing driver. The conversation began three seconds later (around PK
11+958). It lasted 46 seconds. The driver Was interested in Whether the incident Was already resolved,
and in the braking by DM. The speed continued to increase.
Between 20:19:02 and 20:28:33, the train passed successive signal balises showing

hours, when i stayed close to the permitted maximum (200 kmlh) with no further slowing. Progress
Was normal
At 20:29:02
an
acoustic signal began associated with the first speed alert from the
ASFA digital
system, as 201.25 km/h
was exceeded. The signal ended at 20:29:49, When speed slowed to below
197 kmlh. Total duration of alert: 47 seconds (first speed alert)。
At 20:30:33 another acoustic signal began, associated with the first speed alert from the ASFA
digital system, when 201.25 km/h
Was
again exceeded. The signal ended at 20:31:45, with speed
back below 197 km/h. Total alert duration: 72 seconds (second speed alert)。
Various signal balises were passed until 20:36:58. These showed `track clear' (with corresponding acoustic
signals from the system). Speed was close to the permitted maximum (200 kmlh) and was not reduced。
At 20:39:06 (PK 77+780) the driver received another call on the corporate mobile telephone (second
callin motion). Nine seconds later, at 20:39:15, the conversation began. At this moment; the train Was
at PK 78+280 at a speed of 199 km/h。
The conversation lasted 100 seconds. It ended at 20:40:55, level with PK 83+821.
The caller Was the
train manager asking if the train Would fit on to track 2 (section) at Puentedeume station. This Was to
help a family to alight and get out of the station. During this time (100 seconds) the following events
occurred:
At 20:39:23 (eight seconds into the conversation) it passed
a neutral zone between PKs 78+646
and 79+056, and the driver pre-acknowledged (by pressing a button).
The train passed the first two proximity signs (boards at PKs 80+086 and 80+278) for caution
signal E' 7 and maintained speed。
At 20:39:52 i passed the approach balise (PK 80+319) to caution signal E'7 for A Grandeira
branch。
This showed
track clear
(the system gave
an acoustic signal). Speed
was 199 km/h。
Then i passed the third and last proximity sign (PK 80+398) for E' 7
Around 20:39:58 it passed signal E' 7 (PK 80+619, no balise) and maintained speed。
According to the drivers statement in this zone he had the instruction to reduce speed to the
limit (80 kmlh) in force
3 600
metres further
on (PK 84+230,
Angrois bend at
A
Grandeira
branch). In this case he did not do SO
The train entered the Marrozos tunnel (marked by a board at the entrance; PK 80+671).
In the tunnel at 20:40:01, i passed PK 80+803 Where there is a board warning of the change of
ASFA mode (from high-speed to conventional); but the driver did not make this change. Speed
was maintained. This Was 46 seconds into the telephone call。

It crossed
Eixo viaduct (marked at the start by a board, PK 82+112)
It entered the Santiago tunnel (marked at the entrance by a board, PK 83+465).
In that tunnel at 20:40:55, the last sound of the driver's voice can be heard in the telephone call。
This Was 100 seconds after the start of the call, during Which 5 540 metres were travelled.
The train Went on through the tunnel. At 20:40:56 it passed the approach balise (PK 83+876) to signal
E7 at the entrance to the
A
Grandeira branch, showing
track clear' (with acoustic signal from the
system)。
At 20:40:59,
PK 84+009, the driver applied the emergency brake (on the service brake
handle) while travelling at 195 kmlh. The train then emerged from the tunnel (PK 84+106).
At 20:41:02 it passed the balise at the foot of signal E7 (PK 84+171), Which Was showing `track clear'
(with acoustic signal from the system) at 195 kmjh。
Then at PK 84+228, the transition to the Angrois bend began
This is the start of the 80 km/h
limit according to the timetable。 Hence, at around 20:41:03, the train slowed to around
191 km/h. It also passed the speed reduction sign (PK 84+273) and viaduct E-OL on Which the sign
stands。
Near the end (PK 84+428) of the initial transition stretch Of the Angrois bend, the derailment began
(point 0), at PK 84+413. Time Was 20:41:06; speed 179 kmlh。
Images recorded by the security cameras installed on line 082 show that train 150/151 had reached
the Angrois bend at the time of derailment. The head power car, in position 1, had entered the bend。
The

and
then
(but
almost
simultaneously) a Sideways shift towards the outside of the curve (right-hand side in the direction of

Apparently the generation
as i left the track; also pulled the power
car Off the track and the
coaches in the positions behind the generation car。
A
large flashover
Was noticed near the
catenary;
possibly as the contact wire touched part of the train, or part of the catenary masts Which i dragged
along:
The power car ran on, going Off the side of the track (outside of the curve;
right-hand side in direction
Of travel of the train). It twisted to the right along its longitudinal axis (still in the direction of travel). It
ended up resting on its right side on Which it slid (already Off the track), dragging catenary masts,
including the post supporting the security camera。
At 20:41:16 (according to the audio recording) the derailment ended at PK 84+684. The 13 coaches
making up the train
were derailed Off track 1,

What had happened. Later two more conversations were held
Both main tracks of line 082 were blocked at the A Grandeira branch. A third track, Which starts at that
point, next to the others but belonging to line 822 (Zamora
A
Corufa), Was also treated as out of
service, to facilitate the Work of assistance and repair, although this third track Was not affected by the
accident。
Track 2
was not opened to traffic until 26 July and track 1 remained closed until 29 July.

DISCUSSION
With regard to the drivers Statement [section 3.11
The drivers statement to Magistrates' Court No 3 of Santiago de Compostela says that he should
have been travelling at 80 kmlh at PK 84+300,i.e.
on the Angrois bend. He therefore started to
reduce speed normally at caution signal E'7 [located at PK 80+619], but that day he took i [the
bend] at around 190 kmlh。
Wthregardto hherequlatory documentsn the cabIsection3.23.11
The driver had the required documentation at his disposal: the train logbook and train timetable
(timetable book).
According to the train logbook, there
Were
no temporary speed restrictions near the point of
derailment (PK 84+413 of line 082).
The train timetable (book) showed a change of maximum speed of travel from Santiago from PK
84+230, down from 220 to 80 kmlh. This coincided with the Angrois bend where the accident took
place. This change of maximum speed of travel Was also reflected in the Maximum Speed Table for
line 082,and was also indicated in the PTOs。

It Was functioning correctly:
The Ministryof
Development
had
issued  commissioning
authorisation
for
line
082,
Which
commenced service in December 2011.
The regulations applicable from Coto da Torre branch to
A
Grandeira branch point at km 85.0,
the section Where the accident occurred, are the Technical and Operating Requirements (the 'PTOs").
The new line 082, from PK 80.1 (end of ERTMS and start of ASFA) to PK 85.0 (end of line and
junction With line 822 at Santiago station), only has ASFA (as its main system)。
This is the stretch
Where the accident occurred。
The safety case documentation for the Command/Control and Signalling subsystem on the new
line 082 (these include the `safety file) includes
a
risk assessment。
This identifies the risks and
considers that those Which cannot be covered by the specific subsystem should be exported to other
environments. These environments then take over the risks according to the established rules (at least
those relating to the circumstances of this accident)。
To be specific, and with direct application to this accident; the safety case states that `trains travelling
under cover Of the lateral signalling or ASFA (as is the case) shall comply with the Maximum Speed
Table for the line issued by Adif. This risk shall be exported to the driver. '
So
the risk assessment in
the strict
Sense
is
applied to this subsystem (command/control and
signalling)。
The remaining subsystems
are
governed by other risk acceptance principles。
A
joint
analysis
is
therefore
appropriate;
taking
account
Of
the
interaction
between
subsystems
(Recommendation 5).
The last dynamic examination, in
2013, yielded figures indicating that the track Was in
good condition
on the stretch Where the accident took place。
This finding
Was corroborated by
collection Of field data from the track. All values were within tolerance。
The maximum permitted speed
on the Angrois bend (80 kmlh) is reflected in the Maximum
Speed Table and train timetable: I is compatible With the horizontal layout and camber of the curve:
The fixed signals in the form of signage arranged
near the derailment zone (change of ASFA
mode; RGC and speed reduction) comply, in both location and content; with the requirements of the
PTOs。
In fact the PTOs do not require prior, fixed trackside signalling of downward changes in
maximum speed。

Withregard to the rollingstock_involved in theaccident[section3.431
It Was functioning properly:
Rake
730.012, involved
i
the accident
had received
authorisations for commissioning
and
running。
It had an approved maintenance plan. Approved contractors had carried out all servicing required
by that plan, at authorised centres。
The fault logs for the tractor units of the trainset involved in the accident contained no notes Of
outstanding brake defects。
The figures for running the Whole make-up were within the limits set by the maintenance plan
and by the regulations。
The brake test; carried out at Ourense, showed that rake 012, involved in the accident; had
braking on all its axles and Wheelsets。 An estimate Of the deceleration achieved by the emergency
braking, carried out moments before the derailment, yields Values commensurate with the provisions
Of the Rolling Stock TSI。
Due to ERTMS problems from June 2012, the rolling stock Was authorised to run With the ASFA
Digital system switched on throughout the length of line 082.
ERTMS
Was not active at any time on
the Ourense-Santiago stretch. The train was therefore running under cover of lateral signal blocking;
at the then maximum permitted speed of 200 kmlh. This was still so in March 2014.
Therefore the decision taken at the time to modify the physical extent of the ERTMS bore
no direct
relation to the specific causes established for this accident. The incompatibilities which obliged this train
to travel on BSL and ASFA might have arisen even if the ERTMS had covered Santiago de Compostela
station。
While it is possible that the rolling stock involved in the accident could have travelled with ERTMS at its
current extent (up to PK 80+069) and configuration, this system Would not have limited the speed of
entry to the Angrois bend. This Was because, from that point; the train could travel at 200 km/h with
ASFA. It Was the driver Who had to reduce speed, although he would have to have noticed in the cab
that the train had left the ERTMS. Theoretically, this would have been one more factor focusing his
attention on driving. Ifthis had gone unnoticed, the system would have turned on the brakes。
Ihe data logfrom the safetyrecorder on the head locomotive of the train involved in the accident
makes i clear that it left Ourense four minutes late, at 20:05 hours。 It was travelling normally,
reaching its maximum speed of 200 kmlh around 20:23 hours, having passed all signals at green。
It did not start braking at PK 80+619 (signal E'7 to adjust to the 80 km/h limit at PK 84+230
start of
the Angrois bend). Instead, i maintained
a
speed Of nearly 200 km/h up to

CONCLUSIONS
Consequently, in view of the description of events and taking the earlier considerations into account
together with the special reports from Adif and Renfe Operadora, the chief investigator concludes
that:
The cause of the accident Was excessive speed of the train (going at 179 kmlh) on the curve entering
the
A
Grandeira
branch (Angrois bend,
limited
to
80 kmlh).
The
driver
WaS
in
breach
Of the
requirement of the timetable book for train 150/151 and the maximum speed table for line 082.
As
a
contributory cause, We note that the driver was distracted by answering an internal telephone
call from the train manager on
own train Which explains Why he did not brake hard enough to
reduce speed before entering that curve
4.4
FURTHER FINDINGS
Minor discrepancies have been found between the set timetable for train 150/151, the Maximum
Speed Table for line 082 and the practical arrangements (relating to the scope of the ERTMS). These
discrepancies are unrelated to the accident causes。

SPECIFIC MEASURES IN THE ACCIDENT ZONE OF LINE 082
On 13 August 2013, after the accident; Adif installed signage corresponding to two temporary speed limits
on track Lof line 082 heading towards Santiago de Compostela, and near Angrois. These were 160 km/h;
With signs in the run-up (PK 78+778) and at the start of the restriction (PK 80+338); and 30 km/h (initially
due to the repair Of this track after the accident), and also with signs in the run-up (PK 81+669) and at the
start of the restriction (PK 84+400).
A balise
Was also set Up With the sign announcing the temporary
30 km/h speed limit. These signs remained in place on track Iin March 2014。
In the same direction on track 2 (Ourense-Santiago), signs were also set up on the Angrois bend as a
permanent speed limit. There Was a sign giving advance notice Of the speed restriction (as the speed
WaS
greater than 160 kmlh) and signs giving warning; and at the start; Of the 80 kmlh speed limit。
These signs were backed by a balise at the pre-warning sign。
