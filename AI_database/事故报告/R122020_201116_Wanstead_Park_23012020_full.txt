Preface
鼍
The purpose of a Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) investigation is to
improve railway safety by preventing future railway accidents or by mitigating their
consequences。
Itis not the purpose of such an investigation to establish blame or
liability. Accordingly, it is inappropriate that RAIB reports should be used to assign
fault or blame; or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting
process has been undertaken for that purpose.
RAIB's findings are based on its own evaluation of the evidence that was available at
the time of the investigation and are intended to explain What happened, and whyin a
fairand unbiased manner。
Where RAIB has described a factor as being linked to cause and the term is
unqualified, this means that RAIB has satisfied itself that the evidence supports both
the presence of the factor and its direct relevance to the causation of the accident or
incident that is being investigated. However, Where RAIB is less confident about the
existence of a factor or its role in the causation of the accident or incident;
RAIB will
qualify its findings by use of words such as 'probable' or 'possible' , as appropriate。
Where there is more than one potential explanation RAIB may describe one factor as
being 'more' or 'less' likely than the other。
In some cases factors are described as 'underlying' . Such factors are also relevant
to the causation of the accident or incident but are associated with the underlying
management arrangements or organisational issues (such as working culture).
Where necessary; words such as 'probable' or 'possible'can also be used to qualify
'underlying factor'
Use of the word 'probable'
means that, although it is considered highly likely that the
factor applied, some small element of uncertainty remains. Use of the word 'possible'
means that, although there is some evidence that supports this factor, there remains a
more significant degree of uncertainty.
An 'observation' is a safety issue discovered as part of the investigation that is not
considered to be causal or underlying to the accident or incident being investigated,
but does deserve scrutiny because of a perceived potential for safety learning.
The above terms are intended to assist readers' interpretation of the report, and to
provide suitable explanations where uncertainty remains. The report should therefore
be interpreted as the view of RAIB, expressed with the sole purpose of improving
railway safety。
information about casualties is based on figures provided to RAIB from various
SOUrCeS.
Considerations of personal privacy may mean that not all of the actual
effects of the event are recorded in the report: RAIB recognises that sudden
unexpected events can have both short- and long-term consequences for the physical
andlor mental health of people who were involved, both directly and indirectly; in what
happened.
RAIB's investigation (including its scope; methods, conclusions and recommendations)
is independent of any inquest or fatal accident inquiry, and all other investigations,
including those carried out by the safety authority, police or railway industry。

Summary

Shortly before 06:00 hrs on Thursday 23 January 2020,a wagon in the rear half of
3
heavily loaded freight train derailed on a small radius curve as it crossed a bridge
in east London. The forces from the train caused the rails on the bridge, which were
attached to large longitudinal timbers, to spread apart Two adjacent wheelsets
from different wagons derailed, but one wheelset re-railed itself after travelling a
Short distance
The other wheelset remained derailed as the train continued for 2.5
miles (4.1 km) before stopping, and this caused significant track damage. Wagons
positioned behind the derailed wagons remained on the track。
Track Where the rails are supported on longitudinal timbers is subject to special
inspections by staff who have received additional training to undertake this role。
RAIB found that the condition of the timbers at the point of derailment had severely
deteriorated because of rot, but this Was concealed by their superficially
exterior
condition. The inspection method and tools used by Network Rail staff were not
sufficient to detect the poor internal condition of the timber。
The widening of the track gauge Was identified , by track recording vehicles operated
by Network Rail, six times between March 2019 and January 2020. On three
occasions, the track maintenance gangs responded but undertook work in a nearby
location due to erroneous GPS data. On three other occasions, the track recording
Vehicles' software did not report the location of the fault so maintenance staff remained
unaware of it。
One wagon in the train exerted sufficient force on the Weakened track support to force
the rails apart and cause the Wagon to derail. Examination of the first wagon to derail
and its maintenance records indicated that it had experienced unusually rapid wheel
wear over several years. It is possible that this meant it was imposing higher than
normal lateral forces on the track and that this is related to a defect which affected the
way the bogie was able to rotate.
Following the failure of a longitudinal timber on a bridge in the same area in August
2017 , Network Rail launched a review resulting in an updated standard for the detailed
inspection and management of longitudinal timbers. The updated standard was under
development at the time of the accident, and was published in March 2020.
RAIB has made one recommendation to Network Rail regarding improvements in
the provision of track recording vehicle data to track maintenance staff, and one
recommendation to the wagon owner concerning the monitoring of maintenance
activities to reduce the risk of defective rail vehicles entering service。
It has identified
three learning points covering the management of longitudinal timber systems and
loading activities in freight loading terminals。

The accident

Summary of the accident
岂
4
At about 05:54 hrs on Thursday 23 January 2020, two adjacent wagons;
positioned towards the rear of a 22-wagon freight train, became derailed between
Woodgrange Park and Wanstead Park in north-east London。
The rear wheelset
of the leading of these wagons derailed with its right-hand wheel dropping to run
inside the right-hand rail. The derailment occurred on a curve when rail movement
resulted in an increase in the distance between the rails, known as gauge
widening or a Wide gauge fault. This occurred on a bridge on Which the rails were
supported on longitudinal timbers running continuously beneath each rail。
5
About seven metres beyond the initial point of derailment (POD), and at the end
of the bridge, the leading left-hand wheel of the following wagon derailed with
its left-hand wheel running inside the left-hand rail. The five following wagons
continued without derailing after the rails were able to move back and the gauge
reduced。
The derailed train continued for 4.1 km (2.5 miles ), travelling at up to 35 mph
(56 kmlh) and causing extensive damage to the track. The driver was unaware
Ofthe derailment until the brake pipe between the two affected wagons
separated causing the train brakes to apply automatically. The train came to a
stand between Leyton Midland Road and Walthamstow Queens Road stations
(figure 1:
The railway between Woodgrange Park Junction and South Tottenham East
Junction was closed for repair for 27 days, reopening on 19 February 2020.

There were no injuries. Part of the brake system on wagon number 3415 became
detached because of vibration caused by the derailment. There was some
consequential damage to the underside of the wagon's body and wheels。

Context
Location
10
The
Barking to Gospel Oak (Hampstead) line runs in an arc across north-east
London, passing through Walthamstow and Tottenham (figure 2). Electrification of
the line Was completed in 2018. The route now carries a local passenger service
every 15 minutes in each direction, and longer-distance freight trains. In the 12
years prior to the derailment, the route saw a 500% increase in the amount of
traffic; due to increased passenger services and the opening of new freight and
port facilities in east London and Essex (paragraph 55).
11
The train involved in the accident (train reporting number 6254) was travelling
west on the up Tottenham & Hampstead line. The derailment occurred as the
train crossed bridge TAH2/456 spanning Lorne Road, a residential road in
Forest Gate.
The bridge is located at 11 miles 825 yards. "
It forms part of a
4.9 km long section of elevated railway with numerous metal
spanning
roads, interspersed with masonry arched viaducts and some short sections of
embankment:

Train and Wagonsinvolveg
17
Train 6254 formed the 05:31 hrs service from Barking Eurohub to Calvert, near
Aylesbury; via Acton
It consisted of 22 loaded JNA, KEAand JXA open
bogie box wagons hauled by a Class 66 diesel locomotive (number 66154).
Although all three types of wagon had the same capacity; JXA wagons are larger
and heavier than the other two types。

Wagon 3415, the first wagon to derail, Was a JNA bogie box wagon, weighing
27.4 tonnes tare. Its load carrying capacity was limited to 74.2 tonnes so that
its gross loaded weight did not exceed 101.6 tonnes, the maximum permitted

on Network Rail infrastructure. The wagon was fitted with Davis & Lloyd
ESCI
3-piece bogies, and wheels with a PG wheel profile (figure 4).

On departure from Barking on 23 January 2020, the train weighed 2170
tonnes, excluding the locomotive, and was carrying 1435 tonnes of clay
It
comprised a rake of wagons being used on a daily round trip from Barking to
Calvert; returning empty to Barking to be reloaded overnight. Wagon 3415 had
travelled loaded as part of the same train on the same route on nine previous
occasions during 2020, including on the two previous days。
20
At the time of derailment, the train was running at 22 mph (35 kmlh) on a section
of line Where the maximum permitted speed was 40 mph (64 kmlh) and with
the locomotive under power as the rear part of the train was still ascending the
gradient. There is no indication that the handling of the train had any influence on
the cause of the derailment.
21
The second wagon to derail was wagon number 3114. This was a type JXA bogie
box wagon, and was positioned immediately behind wagon 3415.

Railinfrastructure and systemsinvolved
22
The railway is double track, and is electrified with 25 kV AC overhead line.
It has

a maximum permitted speed of 45 mph (72 kmlh) in both directions, although this
is reduced to 40 mph (64 kmlh) in the vicinity of bridge 456 due to the curvature
岂
of the line. The track circuit block signalling is operated by a signaller located at
South Tottenham Station Junction signal box.
23
The track is formed of continuously welded CEN-GO flat-bottomed rails. Most of
the track is ballasted with rails secured to EG47 sleepers by Pandrol FastClips.
On bridges fitted with longitudinal timbers, rails are secured by NRS2 baseplates
Which are attached to the timbers using angled baseplate screws (figure 5 and
figure 6).
Point of derailment (Po01)
456
Figure 5: Bridge 456 following the accident but before removal of the deck walkway
24
On bridge 456, the timbers are held at the correct distance apart by tubular steel
transoms which enclose steel tie rods (figure 6). The timbers rest directly on the
metal bridge deck and are held in position by metal brackets known as cleats。
25
Supporting running rails on longitudinal timbers, rather than using conventional
sleepers and ballast, imposes less weight on the bridge and thereby permits
a
lighter and shallower bridge structure. This increases the clearance for high
vehicles using the roads below. Although less expensive to construct; bridges
with longitudinal timber systems (also known as waybeams, longitudinal wheel
timbers, or longitudinal bearers) are Vulnerable to developing track geometry
faults and so have increased inspection and maintenance requirements。

Network Rail owns over 2,500 spans Where the track is supported on longitudinal
timbers, and has a long-term policy for replacing them With ballasted track where
possible. This normally requires the complete reconstruction of a
to take
heavier ballasted track. On Anglia route, there are still about 200 track spans fitted
with
longitudinal timbers of which about 30% are softwood and the remainder
hardwood.A single span bridge carrying two tracks is counted as two track spans
in this data, and some larger structures carry one or more tracks over several
successive track spans. The 200 track spans represent about 4% of Anglia route's
total number of underbridge spans Where roads, watercourses or other features
pass under the railway。
27
Bridge 456 was constructed in 1893 using fabricated steel girders and a metal
deck and the line opened in the following year The bridge has a single span of
20.5 metres between abutments, Which are skewed at 25。 to cater for the relative
alignments of the railway and Lorne Road. The bridge carries two tracks on
separate; parallel decks with two outer main girders, and a central main girder
positioned between the tracks。
28
The longitudinal timbers vary in depth between 275 mm on the left-hand (cess)
and 350 mm on the right-hand (six-foot) rail. The difference in depth is required
to achieve a designed track cross-level (cant) of 75 mm. The longitudinal timbers
were last renewed in 2008.
29
Network Rail monitors its track using a fleet of track recording vehicles. These
vehicles are formed into trains and cover the national network to a pre-determined
schedule.

The sequence Of events

Events preceding the accident
9
36
Train 6254 completed loading at 03:45 hrs on 23 January 2020 and departed
from Barking Eurohub at 05:33 hrs. The train proceeded via Barking station and

crossed Barking flyover. It passed Woodgrange Park Junction where it joined the
up Tottenham & Hampstead line at about 05:49 hrs.
37
The on-train monitoring recorder (OTMR) data from the locomotive indicates that
the driver
applied full power to climb the
in 65 gradient south of Woodgrange
Park Junction onto the elevated section of line. The train's speed had reduced
from 29 mph (47 kmlh) at the junction to approximately 22 mph (35 kmlh) when
wagon 3415 reached bridge 456.
Events durinq theaccident
38
The right-hand wheel of the rearmost wheelset on wagon 3415 derailed as it
passed over bridge 456 (figure 7). Less than a second later, the left-hand wheel
on the leading Wheelset of following wagon 3114 also derailed causing both
rails to rotate outwards (figure 8). The driver was unaware of these events and
maintained full power. The train gradually accelerated to 35 mph (56 kmlh).
39
Wagon 3114, the second derailed wagon, re-railed itself after travelling
approximately 230 metres and crossing two other longitudinal timber
Rerailing occurred before Wanstead Park station, as the left-hand curve started to
transition into a right-hand curve_
Gauge widening occurred

Wagon 3415 continued with its rear right-hand wheel derailed and running
inside the right-hand rail for approximately 450 metres. As the train traversed a
right-hand curve through Wanstead Park station, marks on the railhead indicate
that the associated left-hand wheel climbed over the railhead and derailed to
the left. The wagon then continued with both Wheels of the rear wheelset of
the trailing bogie derailed to the left. In this condition it crossed a further seven
longitudinal timber bridges and damaged the track (figures 9, 10 and 11).

Analysis

Identification of the immediate cause
43
The track Was unable to maintain the correct gauge as train 6254 passed
oVer 计。
44
A derailment mark on the inside face of the right-hand rail on bridge 456 showed
that a Wheel had dropped into the four-foot (the area between the rails) at
this location. Another derailment mark was identified on the inside face of the
left-hand rail about seven metres beyond the first mark, showing that a second
Wheel dropped into the four-foot. Post-accident examination of the two wagons
involved showed that the Wheels on the derailed wheelsets were at the correct
Spacing. There Was no evidence that
had moved inwards, along the axle, at
any time。
This demonstrates that derailment was a consequence of rail movement
causing the track gauge (the horizontal distance between the rails) to increase by
at least 85 mm, sufficient to allow the right-hand wheel of a wagon to drop inside
the right-hand rail (figure 7). The locations of the derailed wheelsets (trailing on
one bogie and then leading on a following bogie) and the wheels (right then left)
are consistent With classic curving behaviour of a conventional bogie vehicle
on small radius curves, and explain the order that the Wheels dropped into the
four-foot.
45
The absence of derailment marks on the right-hand wheel of wagon 3114 shows
that wagon 3415 derailed at the first
(right-hand rail) derailment mark and
wagon 3114 at the second (left-hand rail). It is
that spreading of the rails
by the derailed wheelset of wagon 3415 provided room for the leading Wheelset
of the following wagon 3114 to derail. The absence of significant damage to
the left-hand rail at the location Where wagon 3415 derailed indicates that the
accident Was
initially caused by the right-hand rail rotating or moving outwards。
46
The relatively low speed of the train meant that the cross-level or cant at this
location Was
greater than required, a condition known as cant excess. When cant
excess is present on a small radius curve, the leading outer wheelset on a bogie
would be expected to be displaced to the outside of the curve (right wheel) and
the trailing wheelset displaced toward the inside (left wheel), and this is the likely
reason Why it was the right Wheel on the trailing Wheelset of the trailing bogie of
wagon 3415 that dropped into the four-foot。
47
A defect pushing the leading wheelset of the trailing bogie further towards the
right-hand rail (paragraph 113) is likely to have increased outward lateral forces
on the right-hand rail。
Identification of causal factors
48
The accident occurred due to a combination of the following causal factors:
3.
the rail restraint was inadequate leading to a persistent problem With wide
gauge (paragraph 49)
b
track recording vehicles identified a wide gauge fault but output derived from
this data did not result in track maintenance staff repairing faults at the correct
location (paragraph 74)
Report 12/2020
19
November 2020
Wanstead Park
they
likely

C
Network Rail was not aware of the severity of the longitudinal timber

degradation and so took no action to deal with this (paragraph 95)
d.
the condition of the trailing bogie on wagon 3415 imposed unusually high
lateral forces on the track (paragraph 111.
Each of these factors is now considered in turn.
49
The rail restraint was inadequate leading to a persistent problem with wide
gauge。
50
The up line across bridge 456 was supported by four longitudinal timbers under
each rail, each about 6 metres long and laid end to end. The combined length of
just over 24 metres was sufficient to cross the bridge and extend a few metres
onto the embankment at each end,
3 feature known as a flying end. This Was to
provide a transition between the relatively stiff bridge deck and the more flexible
ballasted embankment. In the direction of travel, the timbers were numbered
R4 to R1 supporting the left-hand rail (cess rail) and 4L to 1L supporting the
right-hand rail (six-foot rail). The initial derailment occurred close to the joint
between timbers 2Land 1L at the location marked POD

The standard gauge (distance between the vertical faces of two rails on the same
track) on Network Rail infrastructure is 1435 mm. Gauge is either measured
statically; for instance using a hand-held track gauge, or dynamically when
additional deflection due to the forces from passing trains is taken into account。
Dynamic measurements can be recorded either by equipment fitted to the track
or to a train. The response by maintenance staff to wide gauge faults is specified
by Network Rail standard NRIL2ITRKIOO1 mod 11 (issue 8), published September
2015.

The standard indicates that for a line on Which the maximum permissible speed
for trains is between 26 mph and 50 mph (42 kmlh and 80 kmlh), the following

limits apply: If either static or dynamic gauge reaches 1450 mm, the alert limit
is exceeded and track maintenance staff are required to
remedial action.
If the static plus dynamic movement reaches 1460 mm, the intervention limit is
exceeded and remedial action is required within 14 days, or 36 hours if gauge
reaches 1470 mm. If the static gauge plus the additional deflection from passing
trains is 1478 mm or greater, the immediate action limit is reached and the line
must be immediately blocked to all traffic.
These limits are equivalent to wide
gauge of 15 mm (alert limit), 25 mm and 35 mm (intervention limits) and 43 mm
(immediate action limit).
53
Bridge 456's longitudinal timbers were last renewed in 2008 using Douglas Fir
(softwood). Network Rail standard NRIL2ITRK/3038 (issue 4), which was current
in 2008, stated:
'For complete replacement of Longitudinal Timbers on lines with track
categories 1A,
1and 2 only hardwood shall be used. Hardwood timber shall be
used for other lines unless the written approval is obtained from the Railtrack
Directors Nominee for the Use of softwood。
54
The track category is derived from the speed of traffic and equivalent tonnage
using the line; and ranges from 6 (low speed and low use) to 1A, the highest。
It is used to determine inspection frequencies and renewals specifications. In
2008, this section of line carried 2.9 equivalent million gross tonnes per annumz
(EMGTPA) and Was rated track category 4.
55
Between 2008 and 2018, there was a significant increase in rail traffic using
the Barking to Gospel Oak route. During this period the annual tonnage carried
increased fivefold from 2.9 EMGTPA to 15.5 EMGTPA. This was due to both the
doubling of the frequency of passenger services operated by London Overground,
and increased freight traffic associated with Barking Eurohub and the London
Gateway container port near Stanford-le-Hope; Essex, Which opened in 2013.As
traffic increased, the track category changed in steps from 4 to 2
It subsequently
dropped back to category 3 in the immediate vicinity of bridge 456 due to the
40 mph (64 kmlh) permanent speed restriction at that location.
Most of the route
remained within track category 2 (paragraph 22).
56
The maximum weight of vehicles permitted over bridge 456 was managed
through Network Rail's Route Availability (RA) process. The highest routine
category is RA8 Which permits rail vehicles with a maximum gross laden weight
of 91.4 tonnes, but heavier freight wagons are permitted on some lines by a
dispensation issued using Network Rails RT3973 Heavy Axle Weight process
afteran assessment by the route's structures and track engineers. Over 25% of
loaded freight trains operate under a dispensation. The Barking to Gospel Oak
route had a dispensation allowing its use by wagons of the types in train 6254
loaded to RA10, a category permitting a maximum gross laden weight of 101.6
tonnes and a maximum axle load of 25.4 tonnes.
The EMGTPA value is obtained by multiplying actual annual tonnage of traffic by factors allowing for axle weight
and speed.

The softwood longitudinal timbers on bridge 456 were over 10 years old. Anglia

Route's asset management plan showed that bridge 456's timbers were due to
be replaced in 2021. Hardwood timbers would normally be expected to last for at
least 25 years。
58
AGRP (glass fibre reinforced plastic) walkway with a solid surface was installed
on the up line between the longitudinal timbers on bridge 456 when the timbers
were renewed in 2008.Asimilar walkway was installed on the down line across
the bridge in 2018 during
refurbishment work。
ldequate railrestraint
59
Evidence of inadequate rail restraint over a period of time is provided by Network
Rails track gauge measurements. The gauge across bridge 456 had exceeded
the alert limit since at least June 2018 when static gauge of up to 1455 mm was
recorded during a detailed inspection (paragraph 96), equivalent to wide gauge
of 20 mm. Track recording vehicles had recorded dynamic gauge exceeding the
intervention limit at about the same location since March 2019 (figure 13). The
difference between static and dynamic gauge demonstrates that the track Was
flexible enough for the gauge to widen significantly under train loading. Issues
associated With the management of track gauge are discussed at paragraph 95
onwards.

RAIB took post-accident measurements on the bridge to determine f the stiffness
Of the track varied on approach to the
Of derailment。
A
hydraulic ram was

installed between the rails, and the pressure Was increased in increments,
creating spreading forces up to 50 KN (equivalent to 5 tonnes). This test was
repeated at five locations across the bridge. The results show that the rails were
less able to resist movement under the lateral forces imposed by moving trains
as the
of derailment was approached (figure 14). These results are broadly
consistent with Network Rails track gauge measurements. However, it should
be noted that accident damage meant that measured stiffness in the area of
significant damage Will be less than before the accident and, due to distribution
of load along the rails, measured stiffness Will also be lower than pre-accident

Further evidence of pre-accident track movement is provided by the right-hand
rails railhead profile; Which varied in shape across the bridge (figure 15). A
new rail is rolled to a constant profile, but the wear from passing train wheels,
particularly on the outside rail on curved track, Will gradually change this shape.
The rail showed a relatively consistent amount of wear on the side of the railhead
(sidewear), but a pronounced change occurred a few metres before the point of
derailment. In this area, there Was less sidewear, suggesting that lateral loads
from train Wheels caused the rail to move away from the Wheel flanges。
The
consequential reduction in lateral force exerted on the outer rail by the Wheel
flange would have reduced the amount of rail wear。

Following the accident, the up line longitudinal timbers were removed from bridge
456 in four panels, each
comprising the left-hand and right-hand timber with
the transoms and tie bars connecting them. They were taken to a secure site and
laid out for examination by RAIB, an independent timber specialist commissioned
by RAIB and Network Rail (figure 16 and figure 17). The panels were dismantled
in controlled stages during the examination.

The section of timber 2L supporting the track at the point of derailment (figure 18
and figure 19) was cut into sections and examined. It was found to be saturated
with water and extremely soft.A long probe was pushed into the wood at several
locations without meeting resistance and part of the timber disintegrated While
being moved during the examination. There was evidence of baseplate screw
holes having been plugged and re-drilled, indicating that a previous attempt had
been made to restore the track gauge at this location. This method of re-gauging
can only be regarded as a temporary measure in softwood as there is often
insufficient sound material to withstand the forces imposed.

The section of Timber 1L (figure 20) immediately after the

evidence of a longstanding corner fracture (split) and moisture ingress. This was
in thearea Where the
leading right-hand wheel of wagon 3415's trailing bogie was
probably pushing against the rail (see paragraph 111) at the moment the trailing
right-hand wheel derailed. The longitudinal fracture ran through the outermost
baseplate screws.
It is likely that this fracture Was caused by lateral loads
imposed by the screws and stresses associated With natural timber shrinkage
around the screws.

65
The split in timber 1L had been identified and recorded during a detailed
inspection in June 2019 (refer to paragraph 105). The post-accident examination
found evidence of fungi growing within the wood indicating the presence of
air. The presence of a split along the line of the large screws securing the rail
baseplates meant that the outer row of screws became ineffective in securing the
rail. The additional horizontal force applied to the inner row of baseplate screws
had caused their holes to become oval shaped, as the metal screw pressed into
the partly-decayed wood due to lateral loading from trains (figure 21.

The timber specialist's report included the following conclusions:

3
timbers 1Land 2L, adjacent to the derailment location, both had significant
decay Which would have severely reduced their integritylstructural capabilities
b
the extent of decay recorded in timber 2L for approximately 2 metres
approaching the
of derailment was Up to 70% loss of the cross section
C
the amount of decay in timbers 1L and 2L would have resulted in these
timbers being at risk of deforming either permanently, or when loaded.
67
Laboratory examination confirmed that timber preservative was present on the
surfaces, and to a depth of a few millimetres below the surfaces of timbers 1Land
2L. The heartwood, the dense inner
of the tree trunk Which forms the majority
of a timber section of this size; Was not protected. The heartwood of Douglas
Fir originating from North America and Europe is classified as 'extremely difficult
to treat'
even under vacuum and pressure treatment
Preservative
treatments limited to near the surface of the wood can result in timber appearing
superficially sound While deeper decay is hidden。
68
It is probable that the rot was partly a consequence of rust flakes collecting on
the deck and trapping moisture around the base of the timbers. Evidence that
this Was
occurring is provided by photographs taken during an inspection in June
2018 (figure 22). Some of this debris was removed during bridge strengthening
and refurbishment works completed later that year. It is also probable that
evaporation of water from the
deck and some faces of the longitudinal
timbers was restricted by the solid walkway installed between the rails on the Up
line in 2008, which restricted ventilation (figure 5).

Lateralrestraint to timbers
69
Lateral restraint for the longitudinal timbers was provided by cleats attached to

the bridge deck and by the tie rod and transom (strut) arrangement described in
paragraph 24. The timbers supporting the right-hand rail were significantly deeper
than the timbers supporting the left-hand rail due to the need to allow a 75 mm
cant on the curve (paragraph 28).
70
The height of the cleats retaining the right-hand rail timbers was less than 50%
Of the timbers' depth (figure 23).
The combined effect of the cleat height and
tie rod position was to leave the upper section of the timbers 4L-1L with no
lateral restraint except that provided by transferring load downwards through
the decayed timber. The tie rods connecting the timbers together to maintain
track gauge were set horizontally。
passed through the left-hand timbers at
mid-height, but consequently were below mid-height for the deeper right-hand
timbers (figure 24).
71
A revision to standard NRIL2ITRK/3038 (issue 6) published in 2014, requires
new or replacement cleats to be designed with a minimum height of not Iess
than 2/3 the depth of the longitudinal bearer. Although this requirement was not
retrospective, it gives an indication of the importance of the relative height of the
cleats in restraining the timbers, particularly on curved track where the track is
subject to lateral forces。

72
Junction plates connecting the timbers also extended for only part of the timbers'
depth (figure 23) This meant that the outside plate connecting 2Land 1L provided
no support to the upper part of the timber and this is a possible reason for the
longitudinal split developing in this area. The combination of decayed timber and
limited direct support from the tie rods and cleats, possibly exacerbated by the
junction plate arrangement, meant that lateral loading from train Wheels would
result in relatively large movements of the right-hand rail。

73
The track's ability to resist gauge widening on bridge 456 is likely to have

worsened when the vertical split in timber 1L joined up with a horizontal
displacing a section of timber (figure 20). Some of the gauge widening forces
Which could not be resisted by timber 1L will have been transferred by the rail into
the adjacent section of timber 2L Which was already weakened by decay。
74
Track recording vehicles identified a wide gauge fault but output derived
from this data did not result in track maintenance staff repairing faults at the
correct location。

The data includes a trace, comprising a multi-channel graph
showing gauge; alignment and other track geometry parameters。
76
Geometry faults Which exceed the intervention limit are also listed, with their
global positioning system (GPS) co-ordinates, on a track geometry action report。
This is also known as an immediate action report or fault report. Network Rail
states that these co-ordinates are accurate to 士Im, providing the track recording
vehicle is able to receive a strong enough GPS signal. The signal can be
restricted when a train is within a structure such as a tunnel or station. There are
no features of this type at the accident site。
Evidenceoftrack movementatbridge 456
77
RAIB has reviewed track recording vehicle data for the up line across bridge
456 from June 2018 onwards. On 20 June 2018,a dynamic wide gauge fault of
23 mm Was recorded on bridge 456. This value was 8 mm greater than static
gauge recorded at the same location during a detailed inspection on 6 June 2018
(paragraph 97), indicating that track movement was already occurring under
trains.At this stage, the dynamic gauge fault remained below the intervention limit
(25 mm):
78
Similar gauge faults were apparent on two subsequent track recording vehicle
runs during 2018, but the run on 6 February 2019 indicated that the gauge had
significantly improved , recording wide gauge of just 10.5 mm near the POD.
However; the next run on 6 March 2019 recorded a wide gauge fault of 26.9 mm.
Network Rail's central track geometry processing team compared this data with
the previous recording on 6 February 2019 and declared the gauge data invalid
for a 10 chain (201 metre) length of track Which, by chance; included bridge 456.
Consequently; the data Was discounted and did not appear in the associated fault
report So no action Was taken。
RAIB has identified that the February data was
significantly different to previous recordings and may itself have been spurious.
79
On
2019, the next track recording Vehicle run recorded a wide gauge fault
of 29.8 mm in the same location , exhibiting a similar 'shape' to the data recorded
on 6 March
(figure 25). This was the first recognised indication of a gauge fault
exceeding the intervention limit at this location, and was shown on the trace and
listed on the fault report。

On 23
2019, track maintenance staff from Barking depot, led by the team
leader [track maintenance], attended site during an overnight possession of the
line.
The team leader stated that
used an approved app on a Network Rail
mobile phone to locate the fault. This app works by manually entering the GPS
co-ordinates, and this causes the phone to vibrate when within five metres of the
Site, and the display to change colour when within three metres, giving staff a
three to five metre radius around the reported site to locate and inspect the fault。
The process is dependent on the mobile phone 's accuracy When receiving the
GPS signal. In this case, although the GPS co-ordinates
the fault on bridge
456 (figure 26), staff undertook work about eight metres west of the actual fault
location and on a section of track With concrete sleepers。
81
The team leader used a cross-level gauge to identify a section of track with
Wide gauge, and found nine concrete sleepers with crushed or displaced nylon
insulation pads4 supporting the right-hand (high) rail. Members of the team
unclipped the rail , renewed the nylon
and clipped the rail back up. When
they rechecked with the cross-level gauge, it showed that the gauge was back
within tolerance。
The team leader signed a form to confirm that work had been
undertaken, and under the heading
Details of work carried out to repair the
fault' ,
wrote ' Regauged track' .
The team leader stated that he had a quick look at
the longitudinal timbers on the bridge and measured the gauge but did not find
anything to suggest a Wide gauge fault that exceeded the intervention limit on the
bridge。
82
On 29
2019, the next scheduled track recording vehicle run identified and
recorded a wide gauge fault in the same location and same magnitude as on
1
(figure 27). The shape of the graph indicated a very similar pattern of gauge
widening. On this occasion, the GPS co-ordinates on the fault report put the
location of the wide gauge fault just Off the bridge.
Pads are required to electrically insulate the rail from sleepers and clips, and are available in different sizes so
they can be used to adjust the track gauge。

Hysteresis thresholg forreporting faults
87
For the next two track recording vehicle runs on 11 December 2019 and 8
January 2020, Wide gauge faults of 26.5 mm and 30.1 mm respectively were
recorded on bridge 456. On both occasions, the fault exceeded the intervention
limit (figure 29 and figure 30) but was missing from the associated fault report。
88
The same issue caused both omissions and is explained by an extract from the
track recording vehicle trace for 8 Jan 2020 (figure 31). This shows wide gauge
faults, automatically highlighted in red on the trace, corresponding with
456 and 448 located within a section of continuous Wide gauge. The wide gauge
fault of 30.1 mm on bridge 456 is less severe than the wide gauge fault of
34.4 mm recorded on bridge 448.

The TrueTrak recording system used by Network Rails fleet of track recording
vehicles incorporates a feature to provide a single GPS location for each track

geometry fault. Fault sheets are produced following each run Which show the
type of fault detected, its magnitude and the GPS location where the fault is
most severe. They do not show the distance over which the fault extends. To
enable it to distinguish between consecutive faults, the processing software
applies a pre-set quantity known as the hysteresis threshold value. The recorded
magnitude of the fault must improve until it is better than this threshold for the
System to register the end of one fault and the start of the next。
90
For Wide gauge, the hysteresis threshold value Was set nationally at 5.8 mm,
equivalent to a gauge of 1440.8 mm. However, as gauge widening may occur
over long sections of track, particularly on curves, only identifying the location and
magnitude of the peak (widest) reading will have the effect of hiding other peaks
within a length of track Which continually exceeds the threshold.
91
On both 11 December 2019 and 8 January 2020, the hysteresis threshold value
for gauge was exceeded continuously for a distance of about 240 metres on a
section of track Which included bridges 456 and 448. Consequently, this Was
reported as a single fault With a GPS location corresponding to the maximum
recorded wide gauge which occurred at bridge 448. The lower peak on bridge 456
was not reported on either fault sheet and was therefore not addressed。
92
Gauge widening greater than the hysteresis threshold between bridges 456 and
448 probably occurred because of a combination of worn or damaged nylon
insulation pads and rail wear. Network Rail has confirmed that this section of track
did not require designed gauge widening:
93
When the trace and fault reports were received by the TME following a track
recording vehicle run, technical staff at Barking depot reviewed the trace and
compared it with the previous trace
The purpose was to identify repeat faults
and poor sections of track Where intervention is required. Actionable faults Which
exceeded the intervention limit (also known as Level 2 faults
were reviewed
at a regular maintenance planning meeting and entered into Network Rails
computerised workbank (Ellipse) so
could be monitored and closed-out
When remedial work was complete. The TME did not consider that it Was the
responsibility of the depot staff to check that faults shown on the trace were
included on the fault reports and there Was no requirement to do so in the
Network Rail procedure TRK/O01 mod 11

minimum actions' , issue 8 published in September 2015. However, x the review
by depot staff identified an anomaly, this would be checked with the central track
geometry processing team and, xnecessary; the fault would be added to the
Ellipse work bank for correction。
94
The data from the track recording vehicle run on 8 January was received by the
TME on 15 January. At the time of the accident, the technical review was ongoing
in preparation for a maintenance planning meeting scheduled for 23 January (the
of the accident).
Track gauge is sometimes deliberately designed to be a few millimetres wider than 1435 mm on tight curves to
reduce rail Wear。

96
On 6 June 2018, the team leader [longitudinal timbers] for Barking depot
undertook an annual detailed inspection of the timbers supporting the up line
on bridge 456.
This was a role for Which he had received specialist training and
Which he had undertaken for six years. He was responsible for inspecting 21
structures, most of which comprised two individual spans and which incorporated
282 individual timbers。
97
Although the team leader was not undertaking a scheduled Supervisor's visual
track inspection, he used form TEF3021 'Supervisor's Visual Inspection of
Longitudinal Timbers
Issue 6 Sept 2013' to record static gauge readings at 12
positions across the bridge, as there was nowhere to record this information on
the detailed inspection form itself. His report indicates that the static track gauge
ranged between 1445 mm and 1455 mm, equivalent to wide gauge of 10 mm to
20 mm.As the static gauge exceeded the alert limit of
1450 mm, equivalent to
Wide gauge of 15 mm, at several locations towards the middle of the bridge; he
recorded 'adjust gauge' on this form。
98
He also used form TEF3014
Detailed Inspection of Longitudinal Timber System
report
Issue 5 Dec 2010' to record the detailed inspection. He noted that timber
2L Was in 'good' condition, but that there Was a 300 mm long split at the end of
the timber where the derailment occurred.
He recorded that timber 1L was in 'fair
condition With rot starting at the end furthest from timber 2L. He also identified
that the plate decking was corroding, with debris on the bridge. He assessed that
all the timbers on the up line had five years' remaining life. On the final page; he
recorded
Some of the timbers are starting to show signs of deterioration on the
Up road [up line] so life span has been reduced '
99
The GRP walkway fitted between the timbers had not been removed as required
by standard TRK/3038 (issue 6), so the team leader was unable to view the
inside faces of the timber Clause 8.2 Which covers the annual detailed inspection
States:
Where walkway boards prevent inspection of significant elements of the
longitudinal timber system e.9. cleats; transoms and tie rods, the boards shall
be removed to allow inspection '
100 The team leader recorded
Underside of timbers not inspected and 'Inside of
timber not accessible due to fibre glass walkway in his report。
101 The presence of fixed walkways Was an ongoing issue at
spans on the
Barking to Gospel Oak line where there were walkways installed, including
bridges 456 and 448. The team leader stated that walkways were never removed
for inspections (figure 32). The walkway on bridge 456 had been installed to
assist staff walking along the track, but as the bridge was located on a section of
track Where access was prohibited except during a possession or line blockage;
i Was rarely used。
As there was insufficient time during a possession to removel
reinstall the Walkways and complete a detailed examination, the TME planned to
have the walkways removed permanently during 2020.

102 In December 2018, the TME visited bridge 456 during a planned two-yearly
track maintenance engineer's inspection. He observed and recorded a split in a
longitudinal timber on the down line, but did not observe anything amiss With the
track orany of the longitudinal timbers on the up line. The first indication of a wide
gauge fault was not apparent until three months later (paragraph 78).
103 In March 2019, the acting team leader [longitudinal timbers] took over
responsibility for detailed longitudinal timber inspections for Barking depot. On 19
June 2019, he undertook an annual detailed inspection of bridge 456.
He Used
form TEF3021 to record the gauge Which ranged from 1448 mm to 1453 mm,
equivalent to Wide gauge of 13 mm to 18 mm, and Was 14 mm near the POD. The
gauge exceeded the alert limit but remained below the intervention limit and he
recorded 'adjust gauge' on the form。
104 During the detailed inspection he stated that he checked for damage, loose
screws, and large splits but found nothing loose:
He Was unable to inspect the
inside of the timbers and reported 'inside of timber not accessible due to fibre
glass walkway 
He also identified that 12 cleats were corroding and wrote 'New
cleat system required '
105 He identified a split in timber 1L and observed that part of the timber was out of
alignment. He recorded
15mm

and included three photographs of the split in his report (figure 33 and figure 34).

106 In answer to the question 'what method did you use to test timber integrity'
the

report states 'hammer and drill . The report does not record which timbers were
tested, but the acting team leader [longitudinal timbers] did not identify decay
within timbers 1L or 2L. Standard TRK/3038 (issue 6) states
Test drillings of
timber shall only be taken when there are signs of deterioration or other grounds
to suspect decay of the timber '
The photographs show that the visible faces of
timber 2L showed no sign of the interior deterioration. This Was probably because
ofthe effect of the timber preservative (paragraph 67).
107 The acting team leader had not reviewed a copy of the most recent track
recording vehicle trace prior to commencing his inspection, despite his training
telling him that he should do so (paragraph 134). He was therefore unaware that
during the previous month, two track recording vehicle runs had recorded wide
gauge faults on, or near, the bridge (paragraphs 79 and 82).

reported that drainage Was 'G' (i.e. Good) and marked Timber 1L condition as

'General observation & Recommendations' because he considered it would be
repeating information in the body of the report. On 3 July 2019, the TME signed
Off both the TEF3021 and TEF3014 reports without adding any comments.
The
TME stated that it was difficult from a photograph to know the severity of the split
and there Was nothing that brought his attention to the split being a concern。
109 The assistant track manager undertook planned supervisor's visual inspections
of the longitudinal timbers on 8 February, 23
22 August and 10 November
2019. On each occasion, he measured the static gauge (figure 13) and recorded
this on a TEF3021 form.
In the vicinity of the POD, gauge measurements ranged
between 1455 mm (equivalent to 20 mm Wide gauge) on 23
2019,and 1447
mm (equivalent to 12 mm wide gauge) on 10 November 2019. He marked the
timber condition 'Fair' for all eight longitudinal timbers on the up line on each
occasion.

110 On the report for the 22 August 2019 inspection, the supervisor wrote 'timber
gauge job' with a reference number. This referred to a work order to correct the

wide gauge fault that had been raised in Ellipse on 25 July 2018 following the
note added to the detailed inspection report the previous month (paragraph 97).
However; this activity had been repeatedly reprioritised and the work deferred
because site reports and inspections indicated that the gauge Was not
deteriorating and had not yet exceeded the intervention limit. The TME also
understood that the previous five track recording vehicle runs had shown there
were no gauge faults on the bridge, and that the gauge faults that were shown
related to the concrete sleepers near the bridge With crushed nylon pads where
remedial work had been undertaken (paragraph 81 ). Although there was an
established process for raising queries, the TME did not consider it Was his
team's responsibility to cross-check the centrally-produced fault sheets against
the traces for errors or omissions。
111
The condition of the trailing bogie on wagon 3415 imposed unusually high
lateral loading on the track。
112 The curving behaviour of conventional rolling stock means that significant lateral
track forces are normal when trains negotiate small radius curves. However;
the presence of unusually high lateral forces
to the track by the trailing
bogie of wagon 3415 is suggested by the following six wagons not derailing When
travelling over the position where the bogie derailed (the leading bogie of wagon
3114 derailed beyond this position). This implies that the rails on the curve spread
outwards as the trailing bogie of wagon 3415 travelled past, and moved back
before the remaining wagons passed . Damage to bridge timbers (paragraphs 62
to 73) indicates that most of the spread was due to movement of the right-hand
rail. It is possible that the trailing bogie applied unusually high lateral forces
because of a combination of the following two factors:
a defect on wagon 3415
(paragraph 113)
uneven payload (paragraph 124).
Defect on Wagon 3415
113 Evidence that wagon 3415's trailing bogie was imposing a high lateral force
(figure 35) on the right-hand rail is provided in the following paragraphs by
considering wheel flange wear over the previous three years. Curving behaviour
under cant excess suggests that the right wheel flange of the trailing bogies of
each wagon would have been close to, and probably in contact With, the outer
(right-hand) rail (paragraph 46).

114 The corners of the wagon are numbered
to 4in a clockwise direction (as seen
from above). On 23 January 2020, the 2-3 end of the wagon was leading so the
trailing bogie was at the 1-4 end of the wagon. Analysis of maintenance records
provided by the wagon's owner; VTG, shows that wagon 3415 was removed
from service in November 2017, August 2018 and September 2019 because its
Wheel flanges had worn thin and were approaching the wear limit. For wheels with
the PG profile, as fitted to this wagon, the minimum permitted flange thickness
is 24 mm. On each occasion, the significant flange wear had occurred to the
Wheels fitted to the 1-4 end bogie, but only affected one Wheelon each Wheelset。
Records do not show Whether this Was the left-hand side or right-hand side.
On
each occasion, two full profile wheelsets were fitted to the 1-4 end bogie before
the wagon re-entered traffic. VTG's Wheel Exchange Authorisation forms show
that throughout this time, the wheelsets on the 2-3 end bogie experienced normal
wearand were not changed.
115 The most recent wheelset change took place in October 2019. Following the
derailment on 23 January 2020, wheel measurements showed that the right-hand
flanges on the two wheelsets fitted to the 1-4 end bogie were at least 2 mm
thinner than those on the left-hand wheels, despite having been in service for
less than four months. This unusually high wear is consistent With the right-hand
wheels of this bogie running for longer in flange contact with the rail than the
left-hand wheels。
116
A detailed inspection of the 1-4 end bogie; undertaken by RAIB before the wagon
body was lifted from the bogie, found that the bogie centre pivot, provided to allow
bogie rotation when the wagon goes around curves, Was offset by 7 mm to the
right of the wagon body centre-line. This suggested an issue with the bogie pivot
SO RAIB and VTG carried out further examinations of this centre pivot, and the
2-3 end bogie centre pivot, after the body was lifted from the bogies.

To permit bogie rotation, the
ofeach bogie is fitted with a bogie centre pivot
with an internal diameter of 17 inches (432 mm) (figure 36). This encloses and

supports a slightly smaller
centre pivot fitted to the underside of the wagon's
underframe (figure 37). The
parts are designed to allow a radial clearance of
approximately 6 mm between each of the vertical faces within the assembly. This
is to allow the bogie to move laterally into the appropriate position relative to the
wagon body. The large horizontal surfaces of these steel castings are designed to
be in contact and support the weight of the wagon body in conjunction with side
bearers. 6

119 The bogie centre pivots incorporate a central upstand, 40 mm high and 108

mm diameter with a 63 mm diameter hole to contain a pin. The upstand fits into
a recess in the
centre pivot. On the 2-3 end, the
centre pivot recess
measured 43 mm deep, into which the 40 mm high upstand could fit without
making contact at the top when the large horizonal faces of the castings were
in contact. On the 1-4 end, the recess was also 43 mm deep, but it contained a
Smm thick plug of hardened debris-impregnated grease which had the effect of
reducing its depth to 38 mm (figure 40 and figure 41). The grease plug pressed
against the top of the upstand and carried part of the load intended to be carried
on the large horizontal faces. This prevented the bearing from being correctly
seated on the horizontal surfaces (figure 42 and figure 43).

120 Part of the recovered grease plug was tested by RAIB to determine the maximum
compressive force the material could withstand. Samples of the grease were
formed into 12 mm diameter X 4.7 mm thick pellets and placed into a testing rig
Which restricted lateral expansion.A force of up to 60 KN (6,000 kg) was applied
and the amount of compression measured and recorded.A series of samples
were each able to support a load of at least 170 Nlmmz before the grease started
to break down and flow. The test rig reproduced loading conditions that were
similar to those that the grease plug Was subject to when constrained in the
bogie pivot. As the
of the central upstand has a surface area of approximately
6,000 mm?, the grease plug would have been capable of carrying the weight of
one end of a fully loaded wagon body.
121
When the bogie was installed, the grease would have been of a normal viscosity
and would have flowed relatively freely. Grease contains oil and a thickening
agent; but on examination, the grease had lost the volatile compounds of the oil,
and gained some debris. This had resulted in it gradually hardening to form the
plug found in the recess。
122 The source and role of the three pieces of metal debris in the grease plug is
uncertain, but they may have formed as a result of earlier repair work. It is
possible that the metal debris had played a part in transferring part of the wagon
body load into an off-centre position on the upstand, so encouraging an uneven
build-up of dried grease to one side of the pivot。
This could have been enough to
bias the bogie to one side andlor to restrict its free movement:

123 This Wagon defect is considered to be a factor, since the resulting restricted bogie

movement possibly explains the uneven flange wear on the right-hand wheels
of the trailing bogie on wagon 3415 and the abnormally high forces that would
be associated with this. The defect is not considered sufficient in itself to have
resulted in the lateral loading needed to cause the derailment. This is evidenced
by the same bogie passing over bridge 456 without derailing on nine previous
occasions in the same month (paragraph 19).
Ueven payload
124 The wagons of train 6254 had been weighed when
arrived at Barking
for loading, and again after they were loaded on 23 January 2020. On both
occasions, the weighing equipment recorded the weight of each wheel. Weighing
on arrival allowed the amount of residual payload from previous journeys to be
taken into account when determining the maximum amount of material which
Should be loaded at Barking. Prior to loading on 23 January 2020, the average
residual payload in each wagon was about 6.6 tonnes and the maximum Was
13.5 tonnes。
125 The wagons were loaded at Barking using a 3602
excavator with a weighing
facility; working from the right-hand side of the train. This method of loading, and
the nature of the clayey material involved, contributed to the payload in every
wagon being off-set towards the right-hand side when the train left Barking on
23 January. Wagon 3415 did not exceed the maximum gross vehicle weight;
but the load Was concentrated towards the rear right corner of the wagon. The
load on the leading and trailing wheelsets on the trailing bogie weighed 26.4
tonnes and 25.95 tonnes respectively, both exceeding the 25.4 tonne RA10 limit
(paragraph 56). In addition, the payload Was off-set so that the
right-hand
Wheels on this bogie were carrying over 6 tonnes more than the left-hand wheels
with a maximum Wheel load of 14.9 tonnes, Which can be compared to the
12.7 tonnes carried f the maximum permitted vehicle load is distributed equally
between all wagon Wheels (figure 44). The maximum Wheel load is also defined
by Railway Group Standard GMRT2141 'Permissible track forces and resistance
to derailment and roll-over of railway vehicles' as not exceeding 124.5 KN. This is
equivalent to a Wheel load of 12.7 tonnes。

126 Industry guidance? published by the National Freight Safety Group includes the
following advice under the heading
Bulk load distribution' =

'Wagons when fully loaded or otherwise are required to operate within
parameters of weight distribution. Unbalanced wagons change the ride
characteristics of a wagon and are likely to have a greater propensity to derail。
As a
general rule the more evenly loaded from side to side and end to end the
lower the risk。
The side to side placement of the load should be controlled and monitored.
In
practice parties should target for balanced loading and manage their activities to
reduce the potential inadvertent bias generated from loading activities. This can
be achieved by monitoring the performance of their activities (visual or weights
recorded) and providing feedback to the staff undertaking the load placement;
identifying actions to be taken。
The load placement process may require
redesign 讦 staff are unable to adjust loading to within the parameters。
127 RAIB has also analysed wagon loading data for the three preceding journeys. On
three of the four occasions
icluding 23 January; all wagons were more heavily
loaded on the right-hand side. The recorded weight exceeded 12.7 tonnes for
89% of the wheels on the right-hand side of the train on 23 January. Over the four
journeys, the average Was 80%.
128 The magnitude of the payload and its unevenness would have affected the
Vertical loads on the bogie pivot assembly and the side bearers and, as a result,
the horizontal friction forces acting at each of the various associated contact
points and surfaces. It is possible that this combined with the behaviour of the
defective bogie pivot arrangement to exacerbate the restriction on bogie rotation,
thereby further increasing the lateral forces on the rails。
Underlying factors
129 Network Rails inspection and maintenance processes were insufficiently
rigorous to identify timber deterioration before an unsafe situation
developed。
130 Network Rail manages and monitors the safety of its longitudinal timber assets
by a combination of timber inspections by trained staff, data provided by track
recording vehicle runs, and planned track inspections。
131 The acting team leader [longitudinal timbers], who undertook the detailed
inspection in June 2019 (paragraph 103), had attended and passed an 'Inspection
& Maintenance of Longitudinal Timber' training course in January 2019. Delegates
attending this course were required to have already attended a supervisor's Visual
inspection course to enable them to recognise signs of track movement and
interpret track geometry traces produced following a track recording vehicle run。
The acting team leader had attended and passed this course in November 2018.

132 The longitudinal timbers course was run by an experienced Network Rail trainer。

The course materials provided an extensive overview of the issues associated
with inspecting and maintaining longitudinal timber systems. The two-day course
was intended to be entirely classroom-based and the syllabus did not include any
practical elements. There Was no structured opportunity for delegates to look for
rot, wear or damage, and there was no opportunity to practice testing techniques
such as assessing the internal condition of timber by taking drill samples and
sounding with a hammer (listening to the noise made When striking the timber
with a hammer). The training was not specific on Where or how inspectors should
drill into timbers to detect decay。
133 Inspectors are required to assess the remaining life of the timbers, but this is a
Very subjective assessment
not easy to teach without practical elements, and
dependent on variables including the amount of rail traffic; Wheel loadings and
track geometry. The training course included advice on looking for visual signs
Of failure starting, although these can be hard to identify in softwood such as the
Douglas Fir used on bridge 456. Assessing the remaining life of a softwood timber
was not specifically covered by the training. Some assets, such as earthworks,
USe a
scoring system to assess asset condition, but there is no similar system for
longitudinal timber inspections.
134 Delegates were instructed that
should obtain and review background
information, including recent track recording vehicle traces, prior to an inspection。
135 The training course referred to use of the TEF3014 form (paragraph 98), but there
WaS no
guidance on how to complete the form and no guidance on whether the
timber grading (GoodlFairlPoor) should apply to the whole timber or to its worst
The course did not refer to the importance of completing the comments and
recommendations section of the report to guide those responsible for reviewing it。
136 The techniques available to Network Rail timber inspectors seeking to determine
the internal condition of timbers were limited to sounding with a hammer and
taking drill samples. For timbers of this size, the effectiveness of a hammer test
is limited
as a timber that made a hollow sound when hit would already beinan
unsafe condition。
137 The drill provided to inspectors formed relatively large holes with the potential
to introduce water, and so encourage rot, in the inner parts of timbers. Standard
NR/LZITRK/3038 (issue 6) therefore limited the use of drills to instances where
there were signs of deterioration or other grounds to suspect decay of the timber。
As demonstrated at bridge 456, timbers appearing to be in good condition can
have a good surface concealing a rotten core (paragraph 67).
138 The timber specialist commissioned by RAIB to inspect timbers from bridge 456
(paragraphs 62 and 66) concluded that the internal decay in timbers 1L and 2L
should have been detected by an effective inspection regime. The training given

139 VTG's processes did not recognise an underlying problem with wagon
3415 despite the unusual distribution and rate of flange wear on some Of its

wheelsets。
140 The need for frequent replacement of some wheelsets on wagon 3415 and the
nature of wheel wear on the
trailing bogie provided VTG with an opportunity to
recognise a problem requiring consideration as a possible safety issue. However;
the problem was not identified and so VTG did not consider the underlying cause
and its possible implications for safety。
141 VTG stated that it did not have any specific process for monitoring or identifying
unusual wheel wear patterns. Instead, i relied on the vigilance of the
organisations responsible for maintaining the wagons or supplying the wheelsets
to identify wear patterns which might indicate a significant geometry fault. VTG
provided records of wear patterns for wheelsets fitted to other wagons in the
same train, and RAIB found no other examples of wheel wear occurring as rapidly
as on wagon 3415.
142 VTG also stated that uneven Wheel flange wear can occur on wagons fitted with
3-piece bogies, such as those fitted to wagon 3415. The wear often occurs When
the bogie needs to steer on sections of track with small radius curves and no
flange lubrication, such as in sidings. Spilt sand and aggregates collecting on the
trackin
loading areas can also contribute by grinding the Wheelset flanges against
the rails。
143 Although uneven wheel flange wear is not unusual, significant wear on two
Wheels on the same side of a bogie does appear to be so. Wheel wear data
provided by VTG for most of the other wagons on the train, measured following
the accident, showed a variation in flange wear of up to 3 mm when other wheels
on the same Wheelset were compared. However, only wagon 3415 exhibited rapid
flange wear on the same side of both wheelsets on the same bogie.
Observation
144 Three wagons on train 6754 exceeded the maximum permitted weight。
145 Wagon Wheel weights measured after loading on 23 January 2020
(paragraph 125) were used by loading staff to calculate the total weight of the
train, and this weight was passed to a member of DB Cargo staff at Barking:
informed the DB Cargo TOPS office by phone who entered the train's details
into TOPS (Total Operations Processing System) Which is operated by Network
Rail for purposes including assisting management and recording freight train
operations. TOPS carried out some checks before providing output indicating that
the train Was permitted to leave the loading facility. As only the total train weight
had been provided, TOPS calculated the average weight per wagon, checked that
this was within the permitted limit, and released the train for departure。

146 On 23 January; train 6254 departed from Barking with a total gross weight of

2167 tonnes excluding the locomotive。
The maximum theoretical weight for the
22 wagons of train 6254, each at the maximum permitted weight of 101.6 tonnes;
Was 2235 tonnes and TOPS released the train on this basis. However, the train
Was released with three overweight wagons. These were wagons 3114 and 3125
positioned directly behind wagon 3415. These weighed 105 tonnes and 105.45
tonnes respectively, with the weight concentrated towards the trailing bogie in
both cases (figure 44). The other overloaded wagon Was the fourth in the train
and weighed 102.35 tonnes. All three overloaded wagons were of the JXA type
Which are larger vehicles (paragraph 17) and therefore may have appeared to
be less full. These three wagons Were each carrying a residual payload ofat
least 10 tonnes on arrival at Barking (paragraph 124). Despite only three wagons
exceeding the 101.6 tonnes gross weight limit for RA10, uneven loading meant
that 24 ofthe 88 individual axles (27%) had loads in excess of 25.4 tonnes;
and 82 of the 176 individual wheels (46%) had loads in excess of 12.7 tonnes
(paragraph 125)
147
An alternative way to enter train data into the TOPS system, is to input the total
weight of each individual wagon. Had this been done on 23 January 2020, TOPS
would have prevented the train from being released because three wagons
exceeded the maximum permitted weight of 101.6 tonnes (paragraph 18). The
total weight of wagon 3415 was 100.15 tonnes and was not sufficient for TOPS to
prevent the train commencing its journey. Network Rail has stated that it does not
mandate that weighbridge weights for each wagon are entered into TOPS, but if
overloading is identified, the wagons should be returned to the terminal to allow
product to be removed.
148 For the journeys on 18,21 and 22 January; only one wagon in each train
exceeded the 101.6 tonne gross laden weight limit. However, uneven loading
meant that an average of 26% of individual axles exceeded the 25.4 tonne
maximum axle weight limit (paragraph 56).

151 The last bogie of a three-car passenger train derailed due to the widening of

condition. Track maintenance was not sufficient to prevent the condition of the
track deteriorating over time。
A
computer simulation study, undertaken as part of
the RAIB investigation, demonstrated the influence that the leading wheelsets
had on the gauge presented to the following wheelsets. It showed that, on track
having poor rail-sleeper lateral restraint, preceding wheelsets progressively widen
the gauge
It also showed how increased flexibility led to increased spreading
force and hence to progressive rail fixing damage Which resulted in more spread.

152 Two wagons of a nominally empty freight train derailed on the approach to
Angerstein Junction, near Charlton in south-east London. The wagons derailed
because the leading right-hand wheel on one of them was carrying insufficient
load to prevent the wheel climbing up the outer rail on a curved section of track。
The insufficient load Was due to a combination of a track defect, an unevenly
distributed residual payload in the wagon, and an uneven distribution of load
associated with a twisted bogie。

153 One bogie of a wagon in a container train derailed on a set of points as it crossed
between lines at Washwood Heath West Junction, in Birmingham. The bogie
ran derailed for 121 metres before rerailing itself as it ran through another set of
points. The track contained a twist fault of a magnitude Which Network Rails track
maintenance standard specified should be rectified within 36 hours. Network Rail
Was not aware ofthe existence of this fault at the time。
154 Wagons should be capable of negotiating a track twist of a magnitude Which the
track standard allows to remain in a line open to traffic. When examined after the
derailment, the liner on the centre pivot of the bogie Was found to be worn beyond
its maintenance limit. The centre pivot liner is made from a plastic material and
is provided to allow relative movement between the body centre pivot and the
bogie. The worn liner had restricted the freedom of the bogie to rotate, increasing
its rotational stiffness. Furthermore,it resulted in reduced side bearer clearances;
increasing Wheel unloading in track twist conditions. Both the increased rotational
stiffness and the increased wheel unloading reduced the wagon's resistance to
derailment, causing i to derail when it encountered the track twist on the curved
track. The worn centre pivot liner had not been identified during maintenance of
the wagon as the maintenance instructions were unclear about when it should be
inspected.A check on other wagons in the same fleet revealed that a number of
other wagons of the same type had experienced a similar degree of centre pivot
liner Wear

South
Junction in Lewisham. The first of the wagons ran derailed, damaging the track;
then overturned spilling its payload of sand. The RAIB investigation found that
the derailment occurred because this wagon, Which was probably carrying an
uneven payload, encountered a significant track twist on tightly curved track. This
resulted in there being insufficient wheel load to prevent its flange climbing over

Eailureof alongitudinaltimberat bridge 2013HaringeyAuqust20lz
156 Part of a longitudinal timber from bridge 2013 (StAnn's Road) in Haringey; north
London, fell onto the pavement of the street below on another part of the Barking
to Gospel Oak route。
On this bridge; the longitudinal timbers span between
CrOSS
girders but Without a metal deck, So the underside of the timbers is visible
from beneath the bridge.
Amember of the
public reported the incident to the
police. There were no injuries。
157 The longitudinal timbers on this bridge had already been identified as being in
need of renewal, but as this was a relatively long bridge, the work was repeatedly
deferred due to shortcomings with the arrangements for planning and funding
the work. RAIB undertook a preliminary examination, but as the incident did not
appear to be directly associated with the movement of a train, it did not undertake
a full investigation. However, RAIB highlighted its concerns in a letter to Network
Rail and the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) (Appendix C)
158
A Network Rail internal investigation found that the affected softwood timber
had rotted internally to the heartwood, Which crushed under load resulting in
the section of wood detaching. The investigation also found that the route asset
manager was not informed that the timber required renewal and that detailed
knowledge of work needing to be done was lost due to the departure of staff。
159 ORR carried out an intervention and in November 2018, issued a Special
Track Inspections Intervention Report to Network Rail which addressed the
management of longitudinal timbers on Anglia route, including factors relating to
the incident at bridge 2013. The review found that the route conducted no formal
analysis of inspection information to see trends. The report recommended that the
route should define in more detail exactly when and where drill samples should be
taken and When a hammer should be used for sounding.

Summary of conclusions
Immediate cause

台
160 The track was unable to maintain the correct gauge as train 6254 passed over it
(paragraph 43).

Causal factors
161 The causal factors were:
3.
the rail restraint was inadequate leading to a persistent problem with wide
gauge (paragraph 49, see action already taken (paragraph 171) hence no
recommendation, Learning
1)
b
track recording vehicles identified a wide gauge fault but output derived from
this data did not result in track maintenance staff repairing faults at the correct
location (paragraph 74, Recommendation 1)
C
Network Rail was not aware of the severity of the longitudinal timber
degradation and so took no action to deal with this (paragraph 95, see action
already taken (paragraphs 171 to 173) hence no recommendation, Learning
point 2)
d
the condition of the trailing bogie on wagon 3415 imposed unusually high
lateral loading on the track (paragraph 111 ) due to a combination of the
following:
1
a defect on wagon 3415 (paragraph 113, Recommendation 2)
i
Uneven
payload (paragraph 124, Learning point 3).
Underlying factors
162 The underlying factors were:
a
Network Rail's inspection and maintenance processes were insufficiently
rigorous to identify timber deterioration before an unsafe situation
developed (paragraph 129, action already taken (paragraph 172) hence no
recommendation)
b
VTG's processes did not recognise an underlying problem with the wagon or
bogie despite the unusual distribution and rate of flange wear on the Wheels
on some ofits wheelsets (paragraph 139, Recommendation 2)
Observation
163 Three wagons on train 6254 exceeded the maximum permitted weight
(paragraph 144, Learning point 3).

165 Recommendation 5 of the RAIB report into the derailment at Angerstein Junction
is relevant to the Wanstead Park derailment because it relates to the detection
of incorrectly loaded wagons. The intention of this recommendation was to
encourage use of available monitoring data from wheel impact load detection

Systems, such as Gotcha, to inform rolling stock maintenance。
Network Rail should review the potential to use Wheel impact load detection
{
system data to provide information about possible defects, such as uneven
芸
Wheel loading or uneven load distribution, relating to specific wagons。
The
review should include cosideration of how this information could be used to
improve control of overall derailment risk (such as identifying the need for

entities in charge of maintenance to check the condition of suspect wagons and
take
appropriate remedial action) . Network Rail should seek inputs from relevant
entities in charge of maintenance as part of the review. If justified by the review;
Network Rail should implement track side and reporting processes needed for
collecting and disseminating this information。
166 Recommendation 6 is also relevant:
RSSB,in consultation with industry; should review the risks associated with
the uneven loading of wagons, with particular reference to partial loads;
and propose any necessary mitigation, so that the extent of permitted load
imbalance is effectively controlled。

Would have resulted in a RAIB recommendation
171
Following several incidents on Anglia route, including the failure of part of a timber
鼍
at bridge 2013 in August 2017 (paragraph
156), Network Rail commenced a
detailed review of how it manages its longitudinal timber systems. Actions taken
荨
on
Anglia route as a result of this review have included:
a
creating a new role of senior asset engineer (track structures) to centralise

responsibility for managing the process of inspecting and renewing
longitudinal timber systems and to provide support for team leaders based at
簋
depots and responsible for longitudinal timbers
b
instructing TMEs to provide reports to the senior asset engineer (track
structures
for all longitudinal timber structures requiring renewal within three

years so that the asset engineer can check that the correct priority has been
assigned

C
introducing a four-weekly meeting between the senior asset engineer (track
structures), track renewals engineer and structures engineer to co-ordinate the
work of the delivery teams。

172 In March 2020,
Network Rail published issue 7 of standard NRIL2/TRK/3038

Longitudinal Bearer Systems
Inspection , Maintenance and Design' . Issuing
the significantly updated standard was already at an advanced stage when
the accident occurred at bridge 456. The new version of the standard provides

additional guidance for staff and introduces a new TEF 3279 Long Bearer

Recommendations
174 The
following recommendations are made:9
詈
The intent of this recommendation is to reduce the risk that track

maintenance staff miss defects identified by track recording vehicles; it is
likely that work already started by Network Rail will assist implementation
晨
ofthis recommendation。
Network Rail should take measures to improve the clarity of information
provided from Track Recording Vehicle systems, and the procedures
adopted by those investigating defects, to assist track maintenance staff
to correctly locate all recorded defects. The improvements shall include
consideration of:
ways Of identifying discrete defects when these occur within one area
Of relatively poor track quality where multiple defects are currently
reported as a single defect at one location due to the 'hysteresis
threshold' feature of the track recording vehicle system
the extent to which staff should look for defects beyond a nominal
defect position due to inaccuracies in locations determined using
global positioning system (GPS) equipment (paragraph 161).
2
The intent of this recommendation is to reduce the risk of defective rail
vehicles entering service; it is likely that work already started by VTG will
assist implementation of this recommendation。
VTG should review and improve monitoring of maintenance activities
on individual rail wagons to detect repetitive maintenance requirements
Which may indicate an underlying fault Which is not being addressed
(paragraph 162b).
This recommendation may apply to other Entities in Charge of
Maintenance.
Those identified in the recommendations have a general and ongoing obligation to comply with health and safety
legislation, and need to take these recommendations into account in ensuring the safety of their employees and
others_
Additionally, for the purposes of regulation 12(1) of the Railways (Accident Investigation and Reporting) Regulations
2005, these recommendations are addressed to the Office of Rail and Road to enable it to carry out its duties under
regulation 12(2) to:
(a) ensure that recommendations are duly considered and where appropriate acted upon; and
(b) report back to RAIB details of any implementation measures, or the reasons Why no implementation
measures are
being taken。

writing to advise you of the outcome of the RAIB's preliminary examination into an
incident that occurred at St Ann's Road, Haringey overnight on 25/26 August 2017.Alarge
piece of timber was found under the bridge by a member of the public (figure 1, and was
reported to Network Rail by the Metropolitan Police. The wood was
ofan unsupported
longitudinal timber (ie there was no supporting deck plate) carrying the 6 foot rail of the up line
Which had rotted. Network Rail staff initially imposed a 5 mph emergency speed restriction, but
the line was later blocked when track maintenance staff determined that the timber had to be
renewed. The remaining section of the timber was found to have rotted through from the
and it disintegrated as it Was being removed from the bridge on 28 August (figure 2). Sections
examined by the RAIB on 30 August were found to be spongy and wet。

Bridge 2013 carries the Gospel Oak to Barking line (TAH1 and TAH2) over the junctions of St
Ann's Road and Seven Sisters Road in Haringey; north London. The line is currently being
electrified, which will allow an improved passenger service and an increase in the number of
freight paths available to access the London Gateway container port on the Thames east of
Tilbury. Project works have included renewal of four bridges and modernisation of six others,
but the route has still has numerous underbridges with longitudinal timber track support
systems。

The current longitudinal timbers on bridge 2013 were installed in about 1986 with a 20 year
service life. By 2012, their condition had deteriorated to the extent that the Barking Track
Maintenance Engineer proposed that the timbers be renewed。

Longitudinal timber systems, because of their vulnerability, are subject to annual inspections in
accordance with Network Rail standard NR/LZITRK/3038. The last three TEF3014 long timber
examination reports for this bridge have marked the timbers as 'red' , meaning replacement
required in 1-12 months。
The length of the bridge meant that this activity exceeded the
capability of the local delivery unit and required funding from the CAPEX budget. The RAIB
understands that, prior to the incident, this renewal work was planned for 2019.
Prior to the line reopening after an eight month electrification blockade in February 2017, the
newly-appointed Infrastructure Maintenance engineer (IME) sent an email to the RAM [Track]
proposing that advantage be taken of the blockade to gain access and renew timbers. The
RAM [Track] did not take the proposal forward , apparently due to budget constraints. The line
reopened with tie bars fitted and a 20 mph emergency speed restriction. The poor condition
of the longitudinal timbers is illustrated in a photograph dated January 2017 (figure 3) Which
shows the disintegration of the
surface。

Astructures Visual examination report dated March 2017 identified that urgent attention
WaS
required to replace the severely decayed wheel-timbers. This concern Was raised by
the examiner even though longitudinal timbers are not deemed a structures asset。
The IME
forwarded a copy of this report to the RAM [Track] to reinforce his request that action be
taken. The most recent supervisor's inspection in August 2017 also categorised the affected
timber as 'poor'_
It is apparent that numerous warnings were raised about the deterioration of the longitudinal
timbers on this bridge. In view of the similarities with the 1997 Bexley derailment which Was
caused by significant deterioration to the track support and fastenings,
Would like to draw
your attention to the following aspects of this event:
1
The RAM [Track] did not approve Work to renew the longitudinal timbers. The RAIB has
not sought to establish Why, but observes that as the longitudinal timbers on bridge 2013
Were
un-supported (ie there Was no deck plate beneath the timbers
figure 4), so were
required to have the strength necessary to carry and transfer rail traffic loading to the
supporting structure.
2
Areview; required by standard NRILZITRK/3038 when the tonnage of traffic using a
longitudinal timber bridge was expected to increase significantly, either did not occur, or
did not identify that work was urgently required.

It would appear that the sponsors of the electrification project either did not identify, or did
not promotelsupport Work which essential for the project's own success. This is surprising,

as the scope of the project included bridgeworks elsewhere on the line。
The RAIB has decided to take no further action in respect of this incident. However, given
the apparent safety management issues it raises, we advise Network Rail to take the above
points into account when concluding their own investigation and developing recommendations
to prevent a reoccurrence.
